opening comments and I appreciate the
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk with you about sort
 
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
of the court system you're going to be

seeing a lot of me throughout the course
 
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
of the session
 
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
um and and in my role as as a government
 
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
Affairs coordinator I I sort of manage
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
all of the bills that have an impact on
 
00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch and a lot of that
 
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
you'll hear me talk about is fiscal
 
00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
impact because the bills are going to
 
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
have impacts on the resources of the
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
court system
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
affect the way in which we process cases
 
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
or the
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
um the timing of cases where there are a
 
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
number of bills that are in the session
 
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
that would require us to hear cases
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
within a certain period of time so you
 
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
hear you'll hear me say I don't have a
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
policy the court doesn't have a policy
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
position on the bill but I will talk
 
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
about how it impacts our procedures and
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
our processes I am here I'm hope I I
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
hope as a as a resource if at any time
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
anyone has questions always feel free to
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
reach out to me uh
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
can email me and I try to be very
 
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
responsive if for whatever reason I
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.170 align:start position:0%
calling me and I apologize if I'm if I'm
delayed

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
delayed
 
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 align:start position:0%
I did want to just talk generally about
 
00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 align:start position:0%
what our court system looks like judge
 
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
math and clerk McCafferty will fill in
 
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
some of the details but just to sort of
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
talk through what is our system we have
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
two trial court systems we have the
 
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 align:start position:0%
superior court and the circuit court
 
00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419 align:start position:0%
within our Circuit Court we have three
 
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
divisions that themselves used to be
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
courts they were all merged in 2012 into
 
00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
a circuit court system so Family
 
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
Division probate Division and District
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
division are all part of the circuit
 
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
court so so a circuit court judge hears
 
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
everything that is in circuit court so
 
00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:31.259 align:start position:0%
they can hear probate cases they can
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
hear family cases and they'll hear
 
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
District cases district is really the
 
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
the division that you're interested in
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's a criminal and civil cases are
 
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.650 align:start position:0%
that's a criminal and civil cases are
heard

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:41.660 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
and that's that's really where you know
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
the stuff that you were involved with is
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
interacting with the judicial branch
 
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court here's the felonies
 
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court here's the
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and violations beginning
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
January 1st last session the thing
 
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:02.660 align:start position:0%
called felonies first was repealed
 
00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:04.819 align:start position:0%
felonies first
 
00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:08.419 align:start position:0%
changed our processes back in 2015-ish
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
and had all of the felonies get heard uh
 
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
in in Superior Court I'm going to pause
 
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.990 align:start position:0%
in in Superior Court I'm going to pause
briefly

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
and just introduce judge
 
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:23.660 align:start position:0%
and Terry McCafferty clerk of the court
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
in in terms of of our presentation as
 
00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
they settle in I'm just going to give
 
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
some background and really what they're
 
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
going to try to do is is put a little
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
sort of life in terms of what a criminal
 
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
case is when it comes before the system
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh when it gets into the court system
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
and sort of how does it get managed
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the process
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
and and so in in Circuit Court as I said
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
you know a circuit court judge hears
 
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
cases from all divisions and sometimes
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
they're hearing them all in the same
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
morning session you know whatever is
 
00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
coming through is going to be heard by
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
that by that court or by that judge
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
and in general when a layout and then
 
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
I'll be corrected in about 10 minutes or
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
10 seconds in terms of what I say uh and
 
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
and that's fine because they actually
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
know what they're talking about
 
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
if you look very generally at what a
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
system is going through on a on a week
 
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
and I have like this week's docket is
 
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
here it's 49 Pages uh for the Concord
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court
 
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
on Mondays in the morning that's when
 
00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
you get arraignments
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
um so that's you know I'll give rough
 
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
number 65 arraignments are coming
 
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
through that's until 11 o'clock 11
 
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
o'clock that shifts to video so those
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
are the you know uh 8 30 to 11 is live
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock is going to be video
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
arraignments and we don't know how many
 
00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
video arraignments are going to be lined
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
up in that particular morning video is
 
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
set up with the with the jails and is is
 
00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
frequently Limited in terms of time
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
because they're going from one Court to
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
the next so we may have an hour uh with
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
with the jail and then they're moving on
 
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.190 align:start position:0%
with the jail and then they're moving on
um

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a good sense of how
 
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
many video arraignments necessarily are
 
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
going to happen and then Monday
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
afternoon criminal trials and the
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
Overflow from the morning that couldn't
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily that could not necessarily
 
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
get reached Tuesday Morning criminal uh
 
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
proceedings trial management comp uh
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
trial management hearings competency
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
suppression pre-trial sort of criminal
 
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
stuff 11 o'clock go back to videos and
 
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
then in the afternoon criminal trials
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
um Wednesday mornings abuse and neglect
 
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:41.459 align:start position:0%
full hearings these are
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
much more complex or incredibly complex
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
hearings they take time and they require
 
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
sort of lengthy orders when they're
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know a judge has to
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately write something down
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon juvenile cases juvenile has
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
its own sort of procedural issues in
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
terms of them having confidentiality
 
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
issues the scheduling of them has to be
 
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
staggered because you can't have
 
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
everybody in the courtroom at the same
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
time so there are some very complex sort
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
of scheduling and just management issues
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
associated with that
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
frequently these are cases that involve
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
an arrest where police have a very
 
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
limited period of time they can hold the
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
juveniles they happen very quickly they
 
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
can be held for four hours and have to
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
get in front of a judge
 
00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:30.170 align:start position:0%
get in front of a judge
um

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
so you have some very complex both types
 
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
of cases and scheduling and management
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
of cases due to the nature of of those
 
00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:41.459 align:start position:0%
Thursday tends to be civil and then
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
Friday are state criminal cases State
 
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.530 align:start position:0%
Friday are state criminal cases State
Police

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
Police
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and and stuff that's that's generated
 
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
out of the state system every day you
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
have walk-ins you have the the cases
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
that are not scheduled
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
stalking domestic violence uh ex parte
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
dcyf guardianships juvenile arrest again
 
00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:05.459 align:start position:0%
where they have to be where police has
 
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
the the juvenile has to be before a
 
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
judge within a limited period of time
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and then you know all of these are
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
being held by the same or being heard by
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
the same judge so this isn't you know
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
one judge for criminal one judge for
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
juvenile you know they hear all types of
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
cases within the Circuit Court we have
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
about I may be off by one or two we have
 
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
42 full-time judges
 
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
and then we have on the superior court
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
side where the felonies are being heard
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
civil cases and and stuff that's that's
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
on the Civil side we have 21 judges
 
00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:40.910 align:start position:0%
on the Civil side we have 21 judges
there

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of rough numbers in the Circuit
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
Court total number of cases that are
 
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
being filed for those 42 judges is about
 
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
a hundred and five hundred and ten
 
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:53.459 align:start position:0%
thousand of those criminal cases we're
 
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
talking about 51
 
00:12:59.210 --> 00:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
000 to 55 uh 65 000 depending on the
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
year so that's just the criminal docket
 
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
is about 50 to 65 000 in the superior
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
court side where we have about 21 judges
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
uh it's nine to ten thousand cases uh
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
criminal cases that are being heard
 
00:13:12.899 --> 00:13:14.449 align:start position:0%
criminal cases that are being heard
there

00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
um civil cases we're talking in the in
 
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court about 5000
 
00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
um and then sort of I could run through
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers but there's just a lot of
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
cases and a lot of volume so essentially
 
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
every day they are people are in front
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
of them they're moving those cases and
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
then people are showing up again and
 
00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:37.019 align:start position:0%
they're moving those cases and then in
 
00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:38.459 align:start position:0%
between they have to write the orders
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
they have to research they have to do
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
the other stuff but I did think and and
 
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
so I turn it over and ask uh judge math
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
and clerk McCafferty just introduce
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
themselves give a little background but
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
just you know what happens in a criminal
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
case in the court system and how does it
 
00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
what are the sort of steps that a
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
criminal case takes once it shows up in
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
the in the court system so if it's all
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
right with you two I'll just ask you to
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
introduce yourselves and and and just
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
start through the system or through this
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
good morning first I would like to
 
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
apologize for our tardiness I do have
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
I've already had my morning docket at 8
 
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
15 and 9 15. I was able to sneak out if
 
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
you will because my 10 o'clock case was
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
continued so I do apologize for the
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
delay I have been a circuit court judge
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
for 11 years almost 12 years I have been
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
an attorney for 38 years I started my
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
career as a state public defender also
 
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
served as a federal public defender
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
served five years as the deputy Clerk of
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County Superior Court and then
 
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.019 align:start position:0%
the 11 years before I was appointed to
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
the bench I was at the Attorney
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
General's office so I am pleased that I
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
was able to have such a diverse
 
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.810 align:start position:0%
was able to have such a diverse
background

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:49.820 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:51.620 align:start position:0%
I have
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
recently taken senior status which means
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
I am technically retired but I sit one
 
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
day a week still in Concord my first six
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
years on the bench I truly did ride the
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
circuit and I sat all over the place and
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
in fact Salem was one of the places
 
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
where I got to know representative
 
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
Manion because he was a police
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
prosecutor back then and so it's nice to
 
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
see you in another setting uh and Terry
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
will speak to you about her background
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
and then we thought we would take you
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
through the life of a criminal case
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
my name is Terry McCaffrey I'm the clerk
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the Concord Circuit Court I've worked
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
for the court for 19 years I've been a
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
clerk for 13 and I've been in Concord
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
for eight years so as um
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
attorney had mentioned injured Scott
 
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
mentioned the circuit Court's very busy
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
as Clerks of Court were responsible for
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
the entire court which as you know
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
circuit court is family civil district
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
some probate I don't have to have a
 
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
probate but um you know this this just
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of cases as attorney had
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned um it's just a very busy Court
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
we you know we as clerks just kind of
 
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
oversee everything that's going on in
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
the court uh day to day and it's busy
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
constantly running we're very short
 
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:09.380 align:start position:0%
staffed in Concord right now I have
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
for full-time Port assistant three
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
positions open which is a step up from
 
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
quarter 62 is the entry level quarter
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
system three I currently have four
 
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
full-time positions open so all of that
 
00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
work those four people do are now on the
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
backs of the other people uh that are
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
working there so it's it's kind of
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
stressful right now in Concord
 
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
so can you just explain what the cases
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
that you brought and sort of what so
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
what I brought was some criminal cases
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
if anybody wants to take a look at them
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
um as judge staff mentioned this would
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
you know outline the history of the case
 
00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
there's two these are criminal cases
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
there are two different color folders
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
the the ones that are green are to grab
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
the Court's job's attention
 
00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
um uh more quickly because they contain
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
criminal Bill protective orders which
 
00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
are similar to uh domestic violence
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
restraining orders or civil restraining
 
00:16:58.199 --> 00:16:59.449 align:start position:0%
restraining orders or civil restraining
orders

00:16:59.449 --> 00:16:59.459 align:start position:0%
orders
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
um so so we have to pay close attention
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
to them when they come down from court
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that criminal Bill
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
protective order hasn't been amended
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
that doesn't need to be faxed
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
um to the DB registry for entry or to be
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
removed from ncic so that's that's what
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
these cases are so um if you I'll pass
 
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
them around if you want to take a look
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
at them you'll see the criminal
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
complaint the way it comes in you'll see
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
the sentencing order you'll see any bail
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
conditions you'll see on this side
 
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
Financial affidavits for time to pay so
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
they're just um
 
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
that's the the green fold of the the
 
00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:40.100 align:start position:0%
vanilla folders are just regular cases
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
DWI Criminal Trespass Class A or Class B
 
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.710 align:start position:0%
DWI Criminal Trespass Class A or Class B
misdemeanor

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
so if anybody wants to take a look at
 
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.130 align:start position:0%
so if anybody wants to take a look at
those

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
in the Circuit Court in the criminal
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
world we hear Class A misdemeanors which
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
means there's a potential for jail time
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
and those are the cases where if someone
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
qualifies they are entitled to a
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
court-appointed attorney Class B cases
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
are do not carry uh potential jail time
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
so people are not entitled to an
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
attorney there and then violations which
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
are generally like your motor vehicle
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
cases they can be the the speeding the
 
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
handheld violations of texting and those
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
kinds of things so how we first get a
 
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
criminal complaint which is the charging
 
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.330 align:start position:0%
criminal complaint which is the charging
document

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
and is
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
it comes in one of well it always comes
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
to the court first and it comes in
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
either because someone has been arrested
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
they were bailed by a bail commissioner
 
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
who gave them a court date for a later
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
date uh sometimes the police departments
 
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
will give a person a hand summons which
 
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
will tell them what date they're coming
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
that is usually for something like minor
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
the Third Way an arraignment starts is
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
if someone is arrested and held
 
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
overnight without bail or with bail they
 
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
are unable to make and at that point the
 
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
court would hear that case when Richard
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
was talking about video arraignments
 
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
those are for the people who were
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
arrested the night before so I'll hand
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
it over to Terry to talk about what they
 
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
do when the complaint comes in and then
 
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
when we get to that first arraignment
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to you about what we do as
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
judges at that point
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
so when the case first comes in whether
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
it is by just you know handing it over
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
the counter by the police department or
 
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
they mail it in or by uh email we do
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
allow them to email them to the court if
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's for the next day or that day
 
00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
um the clerk's office enters it assigns
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
that a document number creates the
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
folder puts all the necessary paperwork
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
in here bail orders advisement of Rights
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
a few things like that if they're
 
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
detained we don't assign an attorney
 
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
um up front they'll ask for that on the
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
record and we'll schedule them for their
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
next event with an attorney
 
00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:47.289 align:start position:0%
next event with an attorney
um

00:19:47.289 --> 00:19:47.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
and they should have if they're detained
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
they should have a probable cause
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
affidavit if they're not detained then
 
00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:55.460 align:start position:0%
they don't usually have that
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
there'll be a financial affidavit also
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
if they're detained and will assign
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
Council uh that day during the
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
um video uh bail hearing
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
so at arraignment people are not
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
entitled Attorneys at a rainbow
 
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
even an individual who has been held
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
overnight and is having that initial
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
arraignment uh what happens with those
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
cases is by Statute if someone is still
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
held at the arraignment then they are
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
get are appointed an attorney the
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
attorney can request for an immediate
 
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
bail hearing so it will get reviewed
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
very quickly but for the people that
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
walk in on their arraignment date there
 
00:20:35.529 --> 00:20:35.539 align:start position:0%
are a couple of things that could happen
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
one is generally speaking the prosecutor
 
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
will speak to them first to see if they
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
want to work out a plea bargain at their
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
arraignment that does happen with some
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
frequency for some of the lower usually
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
for the lower type offenses uh if it's a
 
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:51.299 align:start position:0%
plea I take it that day and we we go
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
through the acknowledgment of Rights
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
form and the person's pleats that day I
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
if someone wants a trial or is asking
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
for a court appointed an attorney I I
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
will read the charges against them
 
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
review their bail and then if it's a
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
Class A misdemeanor and I've determined
 
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
they qualify for an attorney we then the
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
next thing that scheduled as a trial
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
management conference or a case status
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
hearing if it's a Class B misdemeanor or
 
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
a violation and the folks want a trial
 
00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
the next the date they will be given
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
that day will be that whatever their
 
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
trial date will be so those are the
 
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
files that I just then hand over back to
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
and we process it we assign Council if
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
it's a Class A
 
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
we sent it downstairs if they are
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
fleeing to pay their fine or get their
 
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.630 align:start position:0%
fleeing to pay their fine or get their
paperwork

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
fax paperwork to the jail if it's a if
 
00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
it's a an arraignment all of our
 
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
arraignments are done by WebEx now
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
nobody travels to the court we have been
 
00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:51.299 align:start position:0%
doing telephonic for our video for a
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
while but now everything is WebEx we do
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
we do a good a good amount of hearings
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
by WebEx particularly bail hearings that
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
the public defender has asked for which
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
rescheduled within 24 hours of course
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
they might be at another court so we do
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
all of those by WebEx and and uh the
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
public defender and state may appear by
 
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:12.059 align:start position:0%
WebEx as well
 
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
so then the clerk's office is is
 
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
determining based on the calendar what
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
the next court date will be and when
 
00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:21.539 align:start position:0%
with that next court date if it's the
 
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
class A it will be the trial management
 
00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.770 align:start position:0%
class A it will be the trial management
conference

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh ideally by that time the defendant
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
does have an attorney uh as I know
 
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
you're probably all aware there has been
 
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
a real backlog with finding attorneys to
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
take the cases so
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
at this point unfortunately it
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
frequently occurs that at the trial
 
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
management conference the individual
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
still has not received their court
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
appointed attorney at which point we
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
explain and apologize and we do have to
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
continue them but if the trial
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
management conference goes forward
 
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
a couple of things could happen again at
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
that point the case could plead out the
 
00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:00.059 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and the defense attorney at
 
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
that point time may have come to an
 
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
agreement if that's the case I will take
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
the plea at that time uh if it still
 
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
looks like it's a trial then I get the
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
information we need and what the clerk's
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
office will need as far as the length of
 
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
the trial so we know where we can try
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
and fit it in how many witnesses they
 
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
both sides expect to call and if there's
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
any pre-trial motions is there going to
 
00:23:21.409 --> 00:23:21.419 align:start position:0%
be a motion to suppress is there going
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
to be a motion to exclude some other
 
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
evidence and those are all discussed and
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
deadlines are given for when those
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
motions can be set when discovery which
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
is the police reports and all of the
 
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
evidence against the individual that all
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
has to be turned over to the defendant
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
or defense counsel and all of those kind
 
00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539 align:start position:0%
of anything that's sticky we try and
 
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
take care of at that time and then when
 
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
when I'm finished with those that
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
paperwork then the clerk's office gets
 
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
the file again yep and we send it out to
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
all the parties we give them a trial
 
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
date schedule would send out to the
 
00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.930 align:start position:0%
date schedule would send out to the
parties

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
parties
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I didn't mention
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
when we do the first arraignment there's
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of information a lot of paperwork
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
that has to go with packets that go to
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
the public defender's office they get a
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
copy of everything in the file as well
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
as hearing nurse everything in the file
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
as well as hearing loss is also scanned
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
to the jail so it's very paperwork heavy
 
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
processing wise for the for the clerk's
 
00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.049 align:start position:0%
processing wise for the for the clerk's
office

00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059 align:start position:0%
then when the notices go out for the
 
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:22.940 align:start position:0%
trial or also
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
neglected anywhere along this way there
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
can be motions to continue that are
 
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
filed maybe an attorney is in another
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
court maybe there's some other conflict
 
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
so the clerk's office is also processing
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
a lot more paperwork frequently in these
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
cases because it's
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon for that first trial
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
management conference date or that first
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
trial date to not occur because of a
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
conflict not a court conflict but of the
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
parties a witness may not be available
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes those things come up as well
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
but if we get to the trial date
 
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.070 align:start position:0%
but if we get to the trial date
um

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
again at that point the defendant and
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
the pro the state may have worked out an
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
agreement and there may be a plea
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
instead of the trial if it's a trial and
 
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
they're ready to go and they shouldn't
 
00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:12.620 align:start position:0%
be by that date we will have the trial
 
00:25:15.409 --> 00:25:15.419 align:start position:0%
if we have the trial or The Plea again
 
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
the court makes a ruling generally
 
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
speaking the court is able to make a
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
ruling and if it's a guilty finding we
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
will do sentencing right then and there
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
occasionally I may take a case on under
 
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
advisement if I just
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
need time to think about it one of the
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
things I I have been involved in
 
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
training a lot of new judges and one of
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
the things I really impress upon them is
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
don't feel rushed give this person their
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
full day in court and there may be
 
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
something that you heard at the
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
beginning of the trial that at that
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
point you didn't understand how
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
important it was going to be when they
 
00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
tied everything together and so I may
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
want to go back and look at my notes
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
it's rare but occasionally I might go on
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
a view in a district court case where
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's something about an intersection
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
and what occurred at the intersection or
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
at a restaurant and where this
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
altercation may have occurred and I've
 
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
always found it very helpful to do that
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
as well but if if the case is concluded
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
and the sentence is giving given
 
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
frequently that will include a fine and
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
again at that point the individual is
 
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
asked to return to the clerk's office
 
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
and then the clerks take over again
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
and we uh the majority of people don't
 
00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:27.539 align:start position:0%
have the ability to pay that day of
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
court and ask for a time payment
 
00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
um so they fill out a fine payment a
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit and then the clerk's
 
00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:36.059 align:start position:0%
office simply asked them what they uh
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
what they can reasonably afford to pay
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
each month and then we give them a
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
payment notice and then we collect
 
00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
payment usually because typically we
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
don't usually do 90 days full full you
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
know at the end we say okay so we'll do
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
30 30 Because by the time 90 days comes
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
they kind of forget about it you end up
 
00:26:54.649 --> 00:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
with more defaults so we just kind of do
 
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
a routine a routine payment so again
 
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
that's more work for the clerk's office
 
00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
they're calling in because they can call
 
00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:00.539 align:start position:0%
in a pay it's either calling in over the
 
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
phone there's a lot of foot traffic
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
coming in to make all those payments so
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
the fine payment piece you think it's
 
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
closed because they you know they they
 
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
entered their plea or there was a
 
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:12.059 align:start position:0%
sentence but then that can take you know
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
on its own life as it continues I need
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
more time to pay so the payment pieces
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
is another uh uh pretty good workload
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
for the clerk's office and there's a
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
miss miscellaneous other types of
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
hearings that the court hears one of
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
them would certainly be a fine payment
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
hearing if a defendant has been given a
 
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
lot of time and still hasn't made any
 
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
effort they'll go before the judge and
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about what is going on uh
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
other cases there may be a motion to
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
impose a sentence an individual in a
 
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
class A misdemeanor case may have gotten
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
30 days at the house of correction
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
suspended for one year condition upon
 
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
good behavior which usually means they
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
have no other felony misdemeanor or
 
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
major motor vehicle violation offenses
 
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
if they commit those the state can file
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
a motion to impose the sentence and then
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
we would have a hearing on whether that
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
previously suspended sentence would be
 
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
imposed we have competency hearings if
 
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
anyone it can be the state that's
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
typically the defense or the judge
 
00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:12.419 align:start position:0%
raises the issue of whether a defendant
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
is competent then then he or she is sent
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
for a competency evaluation and then we
 
00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:21.539 align:start position:0%
have a hearing with the doctor and the
 
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
court determines whether the defendant
 
00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:25.220 align:start position:0%
is come or not
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
extradition hearings when someone has
 
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
committed a crime in another state and
 
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
is found and there's a warrant out for
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
their arrest and they are found in New
 
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we then have a hearing to
 
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
determine whether that person will waive
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
extradition and willingly go back to the
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
state where they have the warrant or
 
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
whether they will challenge what's
 
00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
called a Governor's warrant where they
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
can put the state through their Paces of
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
that this is the individual and this is
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
the person who should be returned to
 
00:28:53.289 --> 00:28:53.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with bail conditions we
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
do in in Concord are fortunate enough to
 
00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:00.539 align:start position:0%
have a pre-trial services division for
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
the county and so if someone has been
 
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
put out on bail and are violating some
 
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
of their conditions of bail maybe they
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
were supposed to get a drug abuse
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
evaluation or report every weekly to
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
pre-trial services and they haven't then
 
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:18.260 align:start position:0%
we would have a hearing on their
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
non-non-compliance and and what what
 
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
will happen then sometimes people's bail
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
is revoked sometimes tighter conditions
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
are are placed and again sometimes at
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
that point a person may plead guilty and
 
00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:31.220 align:start position:0%
we take care of the case at that point
 
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
we do have a lot of motions to review
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
bail frequently they are in domestic
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
violence cases where an individual who
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
has a no contact order and the parties
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
do wish now to have contact and those by
 
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919 align:start position:0%
law have to be heard pretty quickly
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
and the judges also handle search
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
warrants uh they just recently changed
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
the process the entire time that I was a
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
Jud I was sitting full time
 
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
Terry was smart enough and and I
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
appreciated very much she set two times
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
a day when police departments could come
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
in to have their warrants and frankly it
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
was 8 30 before I started my morning
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
docket and at 12 30 before I started my
 
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
12 45 docket uh and they would they
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
would come in person pre-coped and I
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
would review all the forms and determine
 
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
whether they would get a search warrant
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
or not uh now
 
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
there is now a streamlined a Statewide
 
00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
streamlined way they do the search
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
warrants and so one judge is assigned
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
for a week at a time and handles all the
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
search warrants uh throughout the state
 
00:30:36.889 --> 00:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
and then they're not given a docket
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
while they're doing that so they're not
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
trying to fit them in like I was trying
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
to do and other judges had to do prior
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
to this system
 
00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
um and so for all of those different
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
motions the clerk's office again has
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
additional work it's very busy close-ups
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
and very busy public defender drops off
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
their mail about 2 30 in the afternoon
 
00:30:56.409 --> 00:30:56.419 align:start position:0%
and it is just filled with requests for
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
to modify bail either
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
the majority of them are criminal Bill
 
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
protective orders at the protected party
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
wants to have contact
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
UM or they could be held on a cash bail
 
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
and they want to review the cash bail
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
they want to be released on a on a PR
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
bail so
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
um you know as Joseph mentioned lots of
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
motions to continue it's very
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
it's it may seem that the case goes to a
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
first arraignment then you know a trial
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
management conference in a trial but the
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
case must be pulled for some kind of
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
filing at least three or four times
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
before it gets from arraignment to that
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
trial date so it's it's very very busy
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the clerk's office and Terry reminded
 
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
me by talking about those when any of
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
those motions come in after it's been
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
processed the judge then needs to review
 
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
them and make a ruling so we have what
 
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
we call a signing desk which literally
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
when I get to it at the end of the day
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
can be like this High just with criminal
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
and there's all the other kind of cases
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
that you deal with but again normally
 
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
during the course of the day we don't
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
have time to review anything other than
 
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:00.380 align:start position:0%
our docket and emergencies that come in
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
I also neglected to talk about mental
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
health Court Concord is fortunate enough
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
to have a mental health court and
 
00:32:09.169 --> 00:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
individuals who uh
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
come to mental health court are
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
sentenced to mental health court and
 
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
they usually have a suspended House of
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
Corrections time hanging over their head
 
00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
in order to comply with mental health
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
court and it's one of my favorite things
 
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
I do to be honest with you these people
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
work so hard to be in compliance
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
generally a lot of them have a dual
 
00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of a mental illness and and a
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
drug addiction so there's a lot there
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
they are helped to a lot of requirements
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
there's counseling you know they have to
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
work have to look for work they have to
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
attend all of their counseling they're
 
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:48.140 align:start position:0%
so motivated and it's a pleasure to do
 
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
but again because of our docket I do
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
that at 12 15 during lunch because we
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
just have to fit it in but it's I think
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly helpful we have lots of
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
graduates lots of people who graduate
 
00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
and it's one of the nicest things that
 
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
we see
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
and um and I'm just going to interrupt
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
it you've been very generous with your
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
time um and I know you have a very busy
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
day so I don't want to fill up anymore I
 
00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:15.659 align:start position:0%
think what I would suggest unless you
 
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
had any final comments is we would be
 
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
um but we've we've taken up some of your
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
time and we appreciate the the
 
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.690 align:start position:0%
time and we appreciate the the
opportunity

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
and in the committee thanks you you're
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
on a Madam Clerk and Mr Richard hat for
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
coming in today
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
um I I would be interested in discussing
 
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
later the potential for setting up a a
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
field trip for the committee to be able
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
to come in and see a session of Criminal
 
00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:39.590 align:start position:0%
to come in and see a session of Criminal
Court

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
um if the members are interested um I
 
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
think that would be incredibly helpful
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
and I agree and I'd be happy to
 
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
coordinate that with you today anytime
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and I also just had a couple
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
of quick questions
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
um and maybe I could knock out some of
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
the committee has as well
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
um can you real quick tell us why
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
um why so many videos versus in person
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
the videos are generally the people who
 
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
have been arrested the night before so
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
they're being held at a house of
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
Corrections and instead of incurring the
 
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
cost of transporting them to the jail I
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
mean from the jail to the court uh
 
00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:14.099 align:start position:0%
they're they're they we now hold them so
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
they're at the jail when they have the
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
hearings so those are the types that are
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
generally done that way occasionally
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
also on a competency hearing the doctor
 
00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
may appear by WebEx as opposed to coming
 
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
to the courthouse and again that's based
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
on their availability okay many more
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
hearings held by WebEx uh during covet
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
obviously but but even still it's kind
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
of continued because some of the folks
 
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
that are incarcerated I think some of
 
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
the jails still have their own protocols
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
and if they go out then they've got a
 
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
quarantine going back in so that they
 
00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
prefer it the the the folks incarcerated
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
really prefer to be by WebEx rather than
 
00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.899 --> 00:34:52.909 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
another question I have is
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned the the difficulty in
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
finding um attorneys to take cases can
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
you can you talk to that uh real quick
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
about like why is that difficulty and
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
what if anything the the legislature so
 
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
primary issue is just volume within the
 
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
public defender's office and number of
 
00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:20.339 align:start position:0%
public defenders I think others could
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
speak more specifically to to Staffing
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
the public defenders are are not funded
 
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
or managed through the court system but
 
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
you know you've you've heard I think
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
over the past year about the shortages
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
in in the public defender system and
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
then separately there are contract
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
attorneys that we we will fund or funded
 
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.450 align:start position:0%
attorneys that we we will fund or funded
through

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
um through judicial Council in order to
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
sort of make up some of that but again
 
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a limited pool of attorneys
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
who are available or willing to do that
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
so you have you know sort of no control
 
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
over the number of cases but a shortage
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
of attorneys and you know just the
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
similar to sort of the number of cases
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
that are heard before the court Jud are
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
attorneys can only manage so many cases
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
at a time and and they're tapped out so
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's really a resource issue in
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
terms of available public defenders and
 
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
then available contract attorneys who
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
would pick up any of the the difference
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
I know that in some other states I think
 
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
particularly one to our South they used
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
to at least have it so that as a member
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
a bar membership I think they had to
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
take so many Public Defender cases per
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
year a judge could just look at an
 
00:36:42.849 --> 00:36:42.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
and some of it is is what is the ability
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
of the attorney
 
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people who would
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
prefer not to see me showing up to to be
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
representing them in a criminal case
 
00:36:58.730 --> 00:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
um and so the bar does have a public
 
00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.710 align:start position:0%
um and so the bar does have a public
service

00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
objective but it is not tied
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
specifically to the criminal practice
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
okay all right that's something that I
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
find interesting I'd like to talk to you
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
about later that'd be great
 
00:37:09.359 --> 00:37:10.190 align:start position:0%
about later that'd be great
um

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
one thing that this committee deals with
 
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
a lot when we we make criminal law is
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
fines and sometimes you'll see a
 
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative say you know fifty
 
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar fine
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
obviously that that's uh Beyond
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
unrealistic how often do you see
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
um people that are end up having to be
 
00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:29.339 align:start position:0%
incarcerated because the fine was just
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
too high or or could you speak to a
 
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
little bit about the the fines back
 
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
was when I was a public defender it was
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
pretty common to be honest that a
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
defendant would serve out their fine at
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
that time it was fifty dollars a day
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
that would get credited towards a fine
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
now it is a hundred and fifty dollars a
 
00:37:48.839 --> 00:37:49.609 align:start position:0%
now it is a hundred and fifty dollars a
day

00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
but the court will not just send someone
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
to jail
 
00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
for their fine it has to be an ability
 
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
to pay issue and to be honest
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
any case where someone isn't paying a
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
fine in my experience has been they
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability at that time so
 
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll try to stagger how much they
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
pay uh community service is also an
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
alternative to work off your your fine
 
00:38:17.569 --> 00:38:17.579 align:start position:0%
what happens sometimes though was
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
someone may have been held pre-trial
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
before they made bail or until their
 
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
plea and we can if that's the case we
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
can credit them 150 a day for each day
 
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
that they were held free trial so you
 
00:38:34.569 --> 00:38:34.579 align:start position:0%
see a fair amount of fines
 
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
taken care of that way as well okay
 
00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:41.099 align:start position:0%
great and uh the last question I had
 
00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
um and it's kind of related to the fines
 
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
was what is the court seeing as far as
 
00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:47.339 align:start position:0%
the homelessness problem as far as being
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
able to to track a defendant to um know
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
where they are
 
00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
um is that becoming an issue as far as
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
some ways again there are there is a
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
large number of homeless individuals who
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
do get charged with crimes a lot of
 
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
times the bail the notices get returned
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
if we even have an address for them a
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
lot of them don't have even an address
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
again in Concord there is a homelessness
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
Resource Center that allows defendants
 
00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:23.339 align:start position:0%
to receive their mail at that address so
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
that has helped uh with with increasing
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
the number of people who do appear I
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have a different
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
observation I think it's a difficult
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
issue I think we've had
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
um you know we've had cases where they
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
file the motion to continue and we've
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
the judges had to deny the state's
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
motion to continue because the defendant
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
is homeless they won't be able to get
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
mail they won't know when the new
 
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
hearing date is
 
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
um or it it it's it's really a difficult
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
issue for the clerk's office
 
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:51.650 align:start position:0%
issue for the clerk's office
um

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
we just can't you know you'll you'll
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
have a person that will
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
um even if they're even if their mail
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
goes to the 238 North Main Street
 
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.810 align:start position:0%
goes to the 238 North Main Street
address

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:03.470 align:start position:0%
address
um

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
that address is the person has to go
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
asking hey do I have any mail and so
 
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes after I think it's three
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
months or so the resource center will
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
send us back all the mail that people
 
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
didn't pick up so you know and homeless
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
is as you know is tied to mental health
 
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
issues and I think it's it's a real
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
challenge for the court system for sure
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
and do a lot of the homeless end up in
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
warrant is that
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
they could because sometimes a lot of
 
00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
times if people don't appear on Crosby
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
or violation of offense and they're
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
homeless we wouldn't typically issue a
 
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
warrant but sometimes that's the only
 
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
way we can get find them as a PR warrant
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
and then they'll you know they get
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
picked up and then we try to get them a
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
new date but it's it's really hard okay
 
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
I can't see your name tag
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
I should know it within a week or so go
 
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.730 align:start position:0%
I should know it within a week or so go
ahead

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent it thank you um so
 
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious I know from some
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
friends experience that the court system
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
got very
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
um got stalled and very backlogged as a
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
result of the start of the pandemic and
 
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering to what extent you've been
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
able to sort of clear that backlog to
 
00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:26.339 align:start position:0%
get to sort of regular backlog as
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to extreme backlog
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
I think the backlog as far as covid has
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh cleared up I think what I'm doing now
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
is you'll see a backlog again in civil
 
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
cases and
 
00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.569 align:start position:0%
cases and
um

00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
concrete pre-trial conferences pre-trial
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
conferences our speeding ticket
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
low-level things like that that has Fine
 
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
amounts what they're called plea by
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
males so if you get a parking not a
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
parking ticket but a speeding ticket or
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
um uninspected vehicle those things that
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
have 62 dollar fine that kind of thing
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
on them we schedule those for pre-trial
 
00:42:00.359 --> 00:42:01.849 align:start position:0%
on them we schedule those for pre-trial
conferences

00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
conferences
 
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
um but I've had to pause those I haven't
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
scheduled any yet for this year because
 
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
I don't have the staff to process them
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm going to be pausing the Civil
 
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
payment hearings you know small claims
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
where they've won judgment and someone's
 
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
problem motion for payments I have to
 
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
pause those because I don't have anyone
 
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
in the Civil Department I do not have a
 
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
civil Department right now
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
um so those are getting paused but
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
because of staffing issues and not
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
because of covid
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
um I know that in the uh there that in
 
00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:41.579 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years I've heard uh
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
numerous times in the committee that um
 
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
there's also a staffing situation uh
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
within the court system itself uh can
 
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
you talk a little bit about that is that
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
something that's that's gotten better
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
gotten worse
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
most businesses have increased their
 
00:43:08.569 --> 00:43:08.579 align:start position:0%
salaries right you saw it everywhere
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
um you know companies went up to Fifteen
 
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
dollars eighteen dollars my son works
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
for Amazon he said I think their minimum
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
pay is twenty dollars an hour so I think
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's a big factor for the court system
 
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
to try to attract people
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
um we're starting our court Assistant
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
two position that starts it's about 15
 
00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
an hour so there's a lot of you know
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
conversation around well that's what
 
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
they're paying at Dunkin Donuts that's
 
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
what they're paying at Walmart and we
 
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
try to have those conversations with
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
people but this is a different job this
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
is a career track you can have a good I
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
started as a course assistant too at ten
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour in 2003. so it's
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
possible to have a good career track but
 
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes hard to reach people in
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
that mindset because they're they're say
 
00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:50.099 align:start position:0%
themselves I understand that but I need
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
to pay my rent
 
00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:53.579 align:start position:0%
um people that started the court system
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know at that fifteen dollars an hour
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
unless you are have a roommate or in a
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
relationship it's really hard to make
 
00:44:02.329 --> 00:44:02.339 align:start position:0%
that make it on your own on that kind of
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
salary so I think that that's why we're
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
seeing reduced staff in most sports and
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
they're really two aspects to the staff
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
shortage we have seen and it does exist
 
00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:14.099 align:start position:0%
throughout the system so uh within the
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
clerk's offices all of them are short we
 
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
often will put out a notice of a
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
position opening and there are no
 
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.790 align:start position:0%
position opening and there are no
applications

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
and in that's common for the
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
applications we see are simply you know
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
for that position not qualified and we
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
do try with a lower level clerk
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
positions to say you know this is an
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity it's a it's a way of getting
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
into the court system and you have the
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
opportunity to advance but salaries are
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
are difficult and then this the other
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
aspect of the shortfall is we've just
 
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
completed a weighted case study that
 
00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:53.099 align:start position:0%
um for the first time since 2005 that
 
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
talks about really for the cases and the
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
number of case as we have what should be
 
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
the full Staffing and what should be the
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
full number of judges and even if we're
 
00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:05.780 align:start position:0%
fully staffed we're short
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
so so you know we have two aspects of it
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
one is to get to the fully staffed
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
aspect of it and then the second is just
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
how do we get enough staff that how do
 
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
we get
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
the the sort of the definition of fully
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
staffed moved so that we can actually
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
manage the caseload and both of those
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
are just sort of compounding on each
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
other now I think you'll see it in the
 
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
chief justices budget presentation where
 
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
both of the the judicial resources and
 
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
the Staffing Resources we're seeking to
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
address and you'll see some of that in
 
00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
have have you um have you tried
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
recruiting at the State House here
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
because I think fifteen dollars an hour
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
is a lot more than we make so you might
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
find some takers we'll put some notices
 
00:45:53.089 --> 00:45:53.099 align:start position:0%
in the elevator it wouldn't be a bad
 
00:45:53.099 --> 00:45:54.470 align:start position:0%
in the elevator it wouldn't be a bad
idea

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
um we could talk to you all day it's
 
00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
incredibly fascinating
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
um oh one more question
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't mean to cut you off
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
Concord District Court does not but
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
um as I said um amazing stuff and I
 
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
would love to talk to you all day I will
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
get with attorney head after and see if
 
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
visit you in your in your environment um
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot to learn there and
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
uh thank you your honor thank you madam
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%

resource to you this session in the the
 
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
full biennium so just to kind of start
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
off like I mentioned there are 12 crisis
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
centers and 11 shelters that provide
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
services to victims and their families
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
Statewide they serve nearly 15 000
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
individuals with direct service support
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
and provide shelter to around 400 adults
 
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
and children annually so we work really
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
we're embedded in communities and we
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
work really closely with folks to make
 
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
sure that they get the resources and
 
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
services they need should they have
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
experienced any any form of Domestic and
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence some of the services
 
00:48:59.450 --> 00:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to highlight so you
 
00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:02.099 align:start position:0%
know sort of what that looks like is
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
access to confidential advocates
 
00:49:07.089 --> 00:49:07.099 align:start position:0%
emergency shelter and housing support
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
including helping find placement in
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
transitional housing in our rapid
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
rehousing program as well as providing
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
shelter for those fleeing violence who
 
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
need immediate safety safety is kind of
 
00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
the umbrella word that we use when we
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
think about this because we really want
 
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
to make sure that anyone who is in these
 
00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:26.579 align:start position:0%
eminent situations get the help they
 
00:49:27.849 --> 00:49:27.859 align:start position:0%
need right away
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
we also provide the crisis centers also
 
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
provide funding for immediate basic
 
00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
needs such as groceries phone cards gas
 
00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
and rent just to make sure that they
 
00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
have everything they need for stability
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
in these situations they also provide
 
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
safety planning which is a way to start
 
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
making sure that victims and survivors
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
think through everything they need in
 
00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
order to stay safe in these situations
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
for themselves and often their children
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
we also ensure that they have connection
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
to Legal Services and this is important
 
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
you heard a little bit about the court
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
system earlier so so helping with filing
 
00:50:08.329 --> 00:50:08.339 align:start position:0%
protective orders is is a huge service
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
that our crisis centers provide we also
 
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
conduct Hospital advocacy which I'll
 
00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
touch on a little bit more when I
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
briefly go over our scene program and
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
then like I mentioned connection to
 
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
Community Resources so they work really
 
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
closely with um
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
different organizations in their
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
Community to ensure that victims and
 
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
survivors have access to Mental Health
 
00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:33.500 align:start position:0%
Services and other other key services
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
and again I'm also happy to take
 
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
questions as we go to if there's
 
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
anything that I can clarify I know it's
 
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of information so please bear with
 
00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.069 align:start position:0%
a lot of information so please bear with
me

00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
um then kind of putting that into the
 
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
context so like I mentioned the
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
Coalition is the umbrella Organization
 
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
for these 12 community-based crisis
 
00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:51.950 align:start position:0%
for these 12 community-based crisis
centers

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
centers
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
um and so we as the Coalition really try
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
to seek to create safe and just
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
communities through our Statewide policy
 
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
and prevention work
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
um to really ensure that quality
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
services are being provided to victims
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
as well as promote accountability to
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
societal systems and communities
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
um and so I think we you know offer
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
technical uh support to our member
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
programs help a draft policies for
 
00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:20.099 align:start position:0%
shelters and things like that to make
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
sure that we provide standard quality of
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
care across the state and we also work
 
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
with a lot of key Partners including
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
state agencies advocacy and non-profit
 
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
organizations other community resources
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
and everything to make sure that we are
 
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
looping everyone in on these systems to
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that it really is a
 
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary approach and we're
 
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
looking at this holistically and so we
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
also provide a lot of trainings to
 
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
different state these some of these
 
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders including law
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement sometimes the court judges
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
and the judicial branch state agencies
 
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
and so on and so really just trying to
 
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
our number one goal is to raise
 
00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
awareness and really just just um be on
 
00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
the same page in in terms of how we
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
won't respond to these issues as a state
 
00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.210 align:start position:0%
won't respond to these issues as a state
um

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
I think I just wanted to quickly
 
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.109 align:start position:0%
I think I just wanted to quickly
highlight

00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
highlight
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
the prevention work our same program in
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
our human trafficking program because
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
they are very specialized and then just
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
go over a few other things as well
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so I think prevention is one of the
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
key things that we really strive to
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
focus on as a state and I think it's
 
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
something that often in the wake of
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
trying to respond to these really
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
intense situations we forget how pivotal
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
prevention is to the work we do and
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
actually ensuring that we're preventing
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
violence before it occurs so the
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
Coalition helps support our Statewide
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
prevention efforts through providing
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
technical assistance to our prevention
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
Educators each crisis center has at
 
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
least one prevention educator that works
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
within the community and sometimes
 
00:52:58.809 --> 00:52:58.819 align:start position:0%
schools to really try to
 
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
build critical skills with the goal of
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
reducing the risk of intimate partner
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
violence and child abuse and so they um
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
it I think teaching like healthy
 
00:53:10.319 --> 00:53:11.690 align:start position:0%
it I think teaching like healthy
relationships

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
um and just identifying signs of abuse
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
um and really working to
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
um increa create informed responses in
 
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
communities and also strengthening
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
Community ties and values
 
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
um so I think a community response to
 
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
prevention education is our ultimate
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
goal because then we're all really
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
working together to prevent violence
 
00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:33.500 align:start position:0%
before it occurs and really
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
act in the moment when we think
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
instances of abuse have occurred
 
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
um I think another thing that I just
 
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight because we're coming
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
up to February somehow is that um in New
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have Granite State respect
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
week during teen Dating Violence
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
awareness month which takes place in
 
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
February I'm usually the week of
 
00:53:59.089 --> 00:53:59.099 align:start position:0%
Valentine's Day and so this is a really
 
00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
important week-long campaign that we do
 
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
within schools and communities to kind
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
of really raise awareness and you know
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
try to
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
um uh support schools and students
 
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
through raising awareness promoting
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
healthy relationships and then of course
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
connecting teens to really critical
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
resources in their communities so that
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
they can get help if they need it
 
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
um and I just wanted to highlight that
 
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
last year we worked with over 26 schools
 
00:54:30.049 --> 00:54:30.059 align:start position:0%
and 19 000 students and school
 
00:54:31.609 --> 00:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
administrators and teachers and so this
 
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
is like a huge program that I think is
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
really important and we're excited to
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
see it expanding
 
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
um and then I just again want to kind of
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
summarize by just saying prevention
 
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
efforts are critical to our ability to
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
adequately respond to Domestic and
 
00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence in New Hampshire
 
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.339 align:start position:0%
unfortunately research shows that
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence has lasting
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
health and financial implications so
 
00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
again we as a state also have an
 
00:54:59.569 --> 00:54:59.579 align:start position:0%
economic benefit from intervening
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
earlier on in these things and can save
 
00:55:04.609 --> 00:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
a lot of money in the long run on Mental
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
Health Services substance abuse Services
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
housing and homelessness services and so
 
00:55:13.609 --> 00:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
on so we really are excited to have this
 
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with all of you to
 
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
hopefully enhance some of these
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
prevention efforts across the state and
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully start limiting the scope of
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
um okay sorry I know it's a lot of
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
information I hope you're also with me
 
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
um so kind of Switching gears a little
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
bit to talk a little bit about some of
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
the the responses to these issues so we
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
have the sexual assault nurse examiner
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
program that sits within the Coalition
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
and this is the program that helps train
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
registered nurses to be specialized in
 
00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
providing trauma-informed care for
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
sexual assault victims who
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
yes the same program thank you
 
00:55:59.089 --> 00:55:59.099 align:start position:0%
um that present to hospitals after an
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
incident of sexual violence
 
00:56:04.609 --> 00:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
um and so this is important work we do
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
across the state with many key
 
00:56:08.569 --> 00:56:08.579 align:start position:0%
stakeholders through the Attorney
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
General's office law enforcement
 
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and so on and Healthcare
 
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
professionals to make sure that we have
 
00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
standard care across all of our
 
00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:21.500 align:start position:0%
hospitals and that we are really kind of
 
00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.530 align:start position:0%
hospitals and that we are really kind of
maximizing

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:23.540 align:start position:0%
maximizing
 
00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
the probability of collecting and
 
00:56:27.609 --> 00:56:27.619 align:start position:0%
preserving physical evidence
 
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:30.140 align:start position:0%
for the potential use in legal services
 
00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:33.500 align:start position:0%
legal system so we don't no one has to
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
move forward but it's just to ensure
 
00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
that that opportunity is there and that
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
everything is followed through protocol
 
00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
and then of course we want to minimize
 
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
the physical and psychological trauma to
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
victims so ultimately first and foremost
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
is ensuring the health and well-being of
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
anyone who comes forward with these
 
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.510 align:start position:0%
anyone who comes forward with these
issues

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
um but then making sure that if they
 
00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
want to they can seek Justice
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and so we provide a lot of trainings
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh throughout the year and there are
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
currently approximately over a hundred
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
sane trained nurses um working in New
 
00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:07.849 align:start position:0%
sane trained nurses um working in New
Hampshire

00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
um and they're located at all 26 of our
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
acute care hospitals
 
00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
um and then we also train on average
 
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
about 35 new nurses every year so this
 
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
is something that we continue to hope
 
00:57:22.849 --> 00:57:22.859 align:start position:0%
expands and I think are seeing the
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
co-directors of this program are more
 
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
than happy to serve as a resource should
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
any legislation come forward that might
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
intersect with these issues
 
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
um and also to speak just about you know
 
00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and sexual violence and
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
and what that looks like
 
00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
um and then I think just to for your
 
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
information uh roughly 300 to 350
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
evidence kits are collected every year
 
00:57:49.849 --> 00:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and um about 75 of
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
those are reported cases
 
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
um and the rest are collected
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
anonymously so again someone who goes to
 
00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
hospital does not have to file a police
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
report they don't have to say their name
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
um they can file it anonymously and then
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
should they choose to go forward then
 
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
that's an option
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
um so our we really want to make sure
 
00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
that survivors first and foremost feel
 
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
safe that their health and safety is
 
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
taken care of and then then support them
 
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
if they move forward with legal
 
00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.549 align:start position:0%
if they move forward with legal
proceedings

00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
00:58:21.049 --> 00:58:21.059 align:start position:0%
um another program I just wanted to
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
quickly highlight is our human
 
00:58:22.559 --> 00:58:23.990 align:start position:0%
quickly highlight is our human
trafficking

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
00:58:27.049 --> 00:58:27.059 align:start position:0%
um collaborative task force or just the
 
00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
task force as I'll refer to it kind of
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
um and this is dedicated to improving
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
the Statewide response to human
 
00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:36.299 align:start position:0%
trafficking it does also sit within the
 
00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:39.059 align:start position:0%
Coalition but it consists of a wide
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
range of stakeholders including the
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice Homeland Security
 
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
investigations State Police the U.S
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
attorney's Office office Advocates of
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
our crisis centers human trafficking
 
00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
survivors and other key stakeholders
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
throughout the state it actually has
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
more than a hundred members so again it
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
really highlights how we really like to
 
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
work collaboratively and
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinarily if that's a word on
 
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
00:59:07.619 --> 00:59:08.210 align:start position:0%
um and then
um

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
kind of the the goal is to coordinate
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
and collaborate to ensure that we have
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
victim-centered and trauma-informed
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
approaches and practices and then also
 
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
hold offenders accountable we there is
 
00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:22.609 align:start position:0%
hold offenders accountable we there is
currently

00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
um a protocol being established through
 
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and so I'd
 
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
be happy to share that once that's
 
00:59:32.329 --> 00:59:32.339 align:start position:0%
available but that's just a key thing
 
00:59:34.609 --> 00:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
that we're working on to make sure that
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
there are a really straightforward and
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
standard responses to these issues and
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
so that we can have these collaborative
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
practices working really smoothly across
 
00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:44.339 align:start position:0%
the state when we need to respond to
 
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
um and I think another thing that the
 
00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
task force does is they are really
 
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
excited and happy to provide education
 
00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
through training and Outreach so if this
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
is an issue that you would like to learn
 
00:59:59.329 --> 00:59:59.339 align:start position:0%
more about um you can invite them to
 
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
come to your community or an
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
organization to provide
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
um just inform informative trainings
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
um they last in 2021 conducted over 46
 
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
trainings and reached more than a
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
thousand participants and unfortunately
 
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that is relevant to New
 
01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:17.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think sometimes we think
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
about it as a more national issue but
 
01:00:22.799 --> 01:00:23.750 align:start position:0%
about it as a more national issue but
um

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
put my numbers from
 
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
yes human trafficking
 
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.609 align:start position:0%
yes human trafficking
um

01:00:31.609 --> 01:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
but so just to give you kind of a
 
01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:35.150 align:start position:0%
but so just to give you kind of a
perspective

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
um victim Advocates from our 12 crisis
 
01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.109 align:start position:0%
um victim Advocates from our 12 crisis
centers

01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
centers
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
um assisted 374 human trafficking
 
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
victims between 200 2017 and 2021 and of
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
those 309 experience sex trafficking and
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
65 were victims of Labor trafficking so
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this is something that we
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
do see in the state and is something
 
01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
that we're working really hard to
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
respond to
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
um and uh we similar to victims of
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence our crisis
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
centers provide a lot of similar
 
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
services so a similar transitional and
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%

translation and language support and so
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
on so this is something that we really
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
try to take a human approach to and
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
really Provide support where it's needed
 
01:01:31.609 --> 01:01:31.619 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I'm almost there thanks I hope
 
01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
this is interesting
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
um so Statewide policy work
 
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to kind of highlight
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
this because this is kind of why I'm
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
here and you'll be seeing my face a lot
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%

resources
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
um moving forward
 
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
um we work we again try to work really
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
collaborative collaboratively with a
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
variety of stakeholders from State
 
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.250 align:start position:0%
variety of stakeholders from State
agencies

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:02:09.049 --> 01:02:09.059 align:start position:0%
um non-profit and advocacy organizations
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%

um as well as survivors and of course
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
you all
 
01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:18.299 align:start position:0%
um I think like I kind of have
 
01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:19.430 align:start position:0%
um I think like I kind of have
highlighted

01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
highlighted
 
01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
um this is such a intersecting issue and
 
01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:23.339 align:start position:0%
it impacts so many different things so
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
it's really important that we engage
 
01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:27.020 align:start position:0%
with a variety of
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
individuals to make sure that we fully
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
understand an issue and how it can
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
impact someone as well as any policy
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
Solutions how it will really be
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
implemented on the ground to ensure that
 
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
it's an effective solution
 
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and I think something that is
 
01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:45.059 align:start position:0%
exciting about working in this field is
 
01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
that it's one of the rare issues where
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
we often have broad bipartisan support
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
and also tremendous Community Support so
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
I just really want to take a moment to
 
01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:56.339 align:start position:0%
thank all of you for the work that you
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
do to ensure that
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
um really effective
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
um positive policies are passed to
 
01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
support victims across the state
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
um and I am just grateful to have had
 
01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:09.299 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work with some of you
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
in the past on these issues
 
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:12.770 align:start position:0%
in the past on these issues
um

01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
um we always again try
 
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
um to bring forward any legislation that
 
01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
has been vetted that we work with
 
01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
various stakeholders so
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
um you know we are always open to have
 
01:03:27.289 --> 01:03:27.299 align:start position:0%
conversations with folks and really make
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not missing anything and
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
that it's really going to have a
 
01:03:33.049 --> 01:03:33.059 align:start position:0%
positive impact
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and again like we're just really
 
01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
grateful for the work that you do
 
01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
um so I'm happy to review anything that
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
you have a question about if you are
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
wondering if it might have an impact on
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
victims I like again we are here as a
 
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
resource and if we don't know the answer
 
01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
we will absolutely find someone who can
 
01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
answer it for you
 
01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
um and kind of on that note um because
 
01:03:56.569 --> 01:03:56.579 align:start position:0%
of the critical work
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
um that you all have done in this
 
01:03:57.839 --> 01:03:58.910 align:start position:0%
um that you all have done in this
committee

01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
um and and the rest of the legislature
 
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
has done we have some of the strongest
 
01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:05.579 align:start position:0%
protocols in the nation um in laws in
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
the nation
 
01:04:09.289 --> 01:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
um and often we are cited as a leader in
 
01:04:09.299 --> 01:04:10.670 align:start position:0%
um and often we are cited as a leader in
advancing

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
advancing
 
01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.410 align:start position:0%
advancing
um

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:11.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.089 align:start position:0%
um
Services

01:04:13.089 --> 01:04:13.099 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
improvements and systems and so on for
 
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.089 align:start position:0%
improvements and systems and so on for
victims

01:04:17.089 --> 01:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
victims
 
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
um and are often cited in actual
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
National and protocols as a sample of
 
01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
what we should strive for
 
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
um so and we're continuously overhauling
 
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
these statutes and rely heavily on this
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
committee for your support
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
um so again I'm really excited to just
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
be a partner in this work
 
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
um and I just wanted to highlight I
 
01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
won't go through all of them but the
 
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office on their
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
website has a list of protocols that we
 
01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
have in the state that range from
 
01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
um you know a model protocol for
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
responding to child abuse and neglect to
 
01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protocol calls and so
 
01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
on and like the like I mentioned the
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
human trafficking protocol that will be
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
coming out soon
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%
um and so those model protocols um are a
 
01:05:02.089 --> 01:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
great resource in terms of looking at
 
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
you know what might already be in
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
statute but then what is already being
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
practiced on the ground
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
um and just making sure that everything
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
kind of um is cohesive and working
 
01:05:10.559 --> 01:05:12.230 align:start position:0%
kind of um is cohesive and working
together

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
um and then I also wanted to highlight
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
um that uh there also was uh the newly
 
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
re-established Governor's Commission on
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
domestic uh violence sexual assault and
 
01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.510 align:start position:0%
domestic uh violence sexual assault and
stalking

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
stalking
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
um and so that is another area that we
 
01:05:29.809 --> 01:05:29.819 align:start position:0%
really hope will help work in um looking
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
at these policies and identifying what
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
new laws or statutes need to be revised
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's something that we are
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
excited to be working
 
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
um with the the commission on and that's
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
something that a project that we will be
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
really taking on this summer and fall to
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
see if there's anything that we'd like
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
to put in or that needs to be put in for
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
next year um so we will definitely keep
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
you all updated
 
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
um as the commission moves forward on
 
01:05:54.059 --> 01:05:55.490 align:start position:0%
um as the commission moves forward on
reviewing

01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
reviewing
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
um you know policies and and key
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
statutes um and but we might also be
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
coming to this committee this year if
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
there are items are what pieces of
 
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that might be on the agenda
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
for the commission that we might ask you
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
to retain or consider holding off until
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
um just because we really want all of
 
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
those stakeholders to have a chance to
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
really review that legislation and make
 
01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.030 align:start position:0%
really review that legislation and make
sure

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
um it's a viable policy and I think
 
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
because the the commission has prosec um
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
it has the support of prosecutors
 
01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys civil legal aid
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
department of justice department of
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
safety and so on so it really is again a
 
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
broad group of people
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
um so that was just I kind of just
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to plug that for you that that is
 
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
a resource for you as well
 
01:06:45.529 --> 01:06:45.539 align:start position:0%
yes um Senator Carson and Senator Jody
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
Nelson are on that committee
 
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
or the commission yeah so um thank you
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
that was an important piece I forgot
 
01:06:54.539 --> 01:06:55.730 align:start position:0%
that was an important piece I forgot
um

01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
all right so kind of Shifting Gears a
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
little I just wanted to highlight a few
 
01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.370 align:start position:0%
little I just wanted to highlight a few
statistics

01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and um areas
 
01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
um really briefly
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
um kind of changing the tone a little
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
bit of the conversation to talk more
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
about the reality of some of these cases
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
um and just kind of talk a little bit
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
more about what we mean when we say
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence so
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
fundamentally it is a pattern of
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
coercive Behavior used by one person to
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
gain and maintain power and control over
 
01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
another in the context of an intimate or
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
familial relationship
 
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
um and so that's kind of where we're
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
coming from is that it's about power and
 
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
control and it's about really
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
um like looking at that intimate and
 
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
familial relationship
 
01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:47.339 align:start position:0%
um however we have Decades of research
 
01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:50.339 align:start position:0%
and practice that tells us that there
 
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
are ways that we can look at those
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
Dynamics and understanding those
 
01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.349 align:start position:0%
Dynamics and understanding those
Dynamics

01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
Dynamics
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
um that we can learn how to predict a
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
lethal event
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's important because
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
often it's New Hampshire is cited as a
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
very safe state which it is but
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the majority of homicides
 
01:08:11.089 --> 01:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
in the state are domestic violence
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
related so I think that's a really key
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
piece to consider when we're looking at
 
01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
those statistics and we're looking at
 
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
what it what it means when we say New
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a safe State
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
um so because there are ways that we can
 
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
make the state safer and so
 
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
um just uh the uh there's a committee
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
called the domestic violence fatality
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
Review Committee and they put out a
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
report every two years so we are still
 
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:39.299 align:start position:0%
waiting on the 20 20 21 report so
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I only have data from 2018
 
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
to 2019.
 
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
um but I just wanted to highlight that
 
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
21 people lost their lives to domestic
 
01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
violence homicide in the state during
 
01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
that time frame and I think there was
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
recently some an article about how the
 
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
homicide rate had actually increased so
 
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
I'm we're curious to see sort of where
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
how that um
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
how that looks this during the last two
 
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.130 align:start position:0%
how that looks this during the last two
years

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
um and then I also just kind of wanted
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
to highlight that unfortunately
 
01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.410 align:start position:0%
to highlight that unfortunately
um

01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
that means domestic violence is a factor
 
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
in more than half of all homicides and
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
actually 77 percent of all murder
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
suicides in the state
 
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
um so I think while we can talk about I
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
think that really just puts it in
 
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
context when we say safety and we say
 
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
that it's addressing the immediate needs
 
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
of survivors that's what we mean often
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're talking about
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
life-saving interventions and so that's
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
why sometimes these policies can be so
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
pivotal because it's really trying to
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
prevent the worst case scenario which is
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
that ultimate lethal event
 
01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.090 align:start position:0%
that ultimate lethal event
um

01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
and so I guess kind of like kind of
 
01:09:52.849 --> 01:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
moving to what we're doing about that I
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight The lethality
 
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
Assessment program
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
um which is a way that we can screen
 
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
um for these instances
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and just kind of help address those
 
01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:07.460 align:start position:0%
um so it's a brief intimate Partners
 
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
homicide screening tool and accompanying
 
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
response and referral protocol for law
 
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement that connects victims in
 
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
these circumstances immediately to
 
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
crisis center services and so I think
 
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
again just highlighting how the
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
immediate response to these issues is
 
01:10:26.209 --> 01:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
just really critical
 
01:10:26.219 --> 01:10:26.830 align:start position:0%
just really critical
um

01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
and part of that includes safety
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
planning and making sure that they have
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
the information and resources that they
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
need to kind of demonstrate how
 
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
important this program is
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
54 of victims so over three three
 
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
thousand individuals from 2018 to 2019
 
01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:47.219 align:start position:0%
screened in as high danger so this tool
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
is identifying cases where immediate
 
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
services are needed and so these are
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
kind of areas that we can work together
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
to when we see policies in legislation
 
01:10:59.689 --> 01:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
that might be changing how law
 
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
enforcement or other Community Partners
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
and stakeholders are responding to these
 
01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:05.780 align:start position:0%
issues making sure that we're not
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
impacting the this immediate response
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
and making sure that we're ensuring that
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
these really dangerous situations are
 
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
not going to occur
 
01:11:18.169 --> 01:11:18.179 align:start position:0%
um and then just kind of briefly wanted
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
to touch on
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and I promise I only have a couple
 
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
more things
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
um I really want to save time for
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions too so
 
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
um but I think just really wanted to
 
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
highlight again we mentioned uh domestic
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
violence and stalking protective orders
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and I just
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
um from that same report we have
 
01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
statistics from 2018 to 2019
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
um to kind of give you a context nearly
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
8 000 victim victims filed for domestic
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
violence petitions and uh 4 200 civil
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
stocking petitions were filed as well
 
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
um and then over 75 100 criminal Bill
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
protective orders were issued in that
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
time frame um so this is something that
 
01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
is occurring in our communities and and
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
requires this response
 
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
um yet only 38 of final orders are
 
01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
granted in domestic violence cases and
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
part of that is because only 12 percent
 
01:12:14.689 --> 01:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
of survivors have access to legal
 
01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:17.540 align:start position:0%
representation in New Hampshire so again
 
01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
ensuring that
 
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
um the like enforcement of protocols and
 
01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
laws are being adequately made can
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
really help address some of these issues
 
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
and making sure that
 
01:12:32.689 --> 01:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
when victims are navigating the system
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
they're getting all the support that
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
they need
 
01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.350 align:start position:0%
they need
um

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that number is even
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
smaller for stalking victims so I think
 
01:12:43.729 --> 01:12:43.739 align:start position:0%
it's about five percent actually have
 
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
about access to legal representation so
 
01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's a huge area that we really want
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
to focus on and make sure that folks
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
have adequate support when they're when
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
they're engaging in this process and I
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
think because I think it's important to
 
01:12:58.729 --> 01:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
say that because I think there's a
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
misconception that it's easy to get a
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
restraining order but you can see almost
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
a third out of the whole picture are the
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
only ones that get granted a protective
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
order so the bar is extremely high and
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
while it's a civil restraining order it
 
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
has criminal consequences so I just
 
01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of bring that into the
 
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.169 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of bring that into the
picture

01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:13:21.179 --> 01:13:21.830 align:start position:0%
picture
um

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
and then yeah I'm happy to take any
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
questions and like I mentioned we are
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
here to help
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
um we will always call you back if you
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
um and additionally we want like if
 
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
there's any questions that constituents
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
have we're happy to help connect you to
 
01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
crisis centers make sure that they get
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
the support they need
 
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
um and really help understanding the
 
01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
services that are available in
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
communities as well as connect you to
 
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and experts
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so I know I kind of covered a wide
 
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
range of things
 
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I could probably do this all day
 
01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
um so I just really want to make sure
 
01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
that you know that we're a resource and
 
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
we're happy to you know talk through
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
this one-on-one if you have
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
um deeper questions
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and like our
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
previous speaker it's a very very
 
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
important and fascinating area of the
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
law that we that we touch on
 
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
um I just myself have a couple quick
 
01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:14.689 align:start position:0%
um I just myself have a couple quick
questions

01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
um funding a lot of the stuff you talked
 
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
about sounded pretty expensive
 
01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:19.490 align:start position:0%
about sounded pretty expensive
um

01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
rent housing food shelter what's your
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
source of funding
 
01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
um several source of funding primarily
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
it is federal but we do have the
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
domestic violence prevention program
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
which is through the state budget so
 
01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
that is something that we will be
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
addressing this year with the budget
 
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
request and so that is about 1.27
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
million every year and that goes to
 
01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:49.140 align:start position:0%
Direct Services so managing the crisis
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
hotline like I mentioned emergency
 
01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
shelter legal services and so on so
 
01:14:56.689 --> 01:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
really providing the immediate Direct
 
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
Services to survivors okay great okay um
 
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
um the same program
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
do do they also conduct their train to
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
do the same interviews where where
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
there's a criminal case if you could
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
just quickly explain that to the
 
01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
committee I mean several of us might
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
know what it is but
 
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
yeah so um the same program so in
 
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
addition to serving as a resource in
 
01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
emergency departments where they
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
primarily operate they also do training
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
for all Health Care Professionals as
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
well to make sure that if there isn't a
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
senior's present they can do that but
 
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
these are folks who are especially
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
trained in the area of sexual assault
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
and how to actually like not only
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
document and collect evidence but speak
 
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
to that evidence so often they may serve
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
as Witnesses in court proceedings
 
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
um you know expert Witnesses and so on
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
um and really just help
 
01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:50.990 align:start position:0%
um and really just help
um

01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
make sure that that process is being
 
01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
followed they work really closely with
 
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement and state lab to
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that kits are being processed
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
and things like that I don't know if I
 
01:16:03.649 --> 01:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
was thinking more about
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
in other words when you have a victim
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
who's a child oftentimes it's very
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
intimidating to have a room full of
 
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
people so the same interviewer would do
 
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's one area that we really
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
am hoping to
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
on because I think
 
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
um all of our scenes are trained in
 
01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
adult and Adolescent and pediatric care
 
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
but that is one area where we hope to
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
have more specializations right now we
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
work um most closely with the Laconia
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
Child Advocacy Center and that was sort
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
of a pilot program to bring in that work
 
01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
there and that's something that we're
 
01:16:37.729 --> 01:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
hoping to see expand across the state
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
but yes we see unfortunately a lot of
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
child victims in those cases and say
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
nurses work really closely to make sure
 
01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:45.709 align:start position:0%
nurses work really closely to make sure
that

01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
that's all I had for questions
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
um and the committee has a few
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
themselves I have to step out to
 
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill I just wanted to thank
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
you so much for coming in and um tell
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
the members of committee this is a great
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
resource several years ago I myself had
 
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
um having to do with firearms and the
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
Coalition advised me that it could be
 
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
problematic for some victims I listened
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
to them I looked into it and they were
 
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct and I pulled the bill
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
so it's very important that you use them
 
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
as a resource at least as a to get some
 
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
background information on what the
 
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
second and third order of effects some
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
of your bills may have and I'm going to
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Vice chairman and I have
 
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
to step out thank you
 
01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:45.490 align:start position:0%
to step out thank you
foreign

01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
my question was I guess about the woman
 
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
who was shot
 
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
um I want to say a year two ago by the
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
person she'd attempted to get a
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
restraining order against um and it was
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
rejected and then he shot her a few
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
weeks later
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to take up a lot of time
 
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
um but as my understanding that there's
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
some debate as to whether or not the
 
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
ruling was in compliance with the law
 
01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
and since that's we make that loss did
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
you have any does your organization have
 
01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
any commentary on that are there any
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
changes you'd like to see in the law
 
01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
yeah um a task force was a result of
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
that incident and there was also a
 
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
committee that reviewed
 
01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
um that as well within the judicial
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
branch I don't think our friends are
 
01:18:32.209 --> 01:18:32.219 align:start position:0%
here anymore
 
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
um but so and then that was sort of the
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
basis for what helped re-establish the
 
01:18:37.729 --> 01:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
governor's commission so that is
 
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
something that we are discussing at the
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
commission to kind of look at closely
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
and address and I'd be happy to kind of
 
01:18:45.649 --> 01:18:45.659 align:start position:0%
chat more one-on-one with you to give
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
you a little bit more information on
 
01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
that because there is a lot there is a
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
lot in that discussion in terms of
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
um just make like how how different
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
folks have interpreted the law and um
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
what how that is then playing out in the
 
01:18:59.159 --> 01:19:00.229 align:start position:0%
what how that is then playing out in the
courtroom

01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
courtroom
 
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
um so definitely be happy to talk more
 
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
I I actually have
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
um a question that's a follow-up from
 
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy he had asked about
 
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
about funding and
 
01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
this is something I actually want to ask
 
01:19:21.169 --> 01:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
you a lot last year and and I never did
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
in some states and because we deal so
 
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
much with um with fines in in this
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
Committee in some states the the fines
 
01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
the actor that money is given to the
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
domestic violence State program and that
 
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
is used
 
01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
to help reimburse the victim for
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
um expenses that they have had that
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
would not have otherwise incurred to
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
them is that something that New
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also does so some of them the
 
01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:56.219 align:start position:0%
money that you do have comes from that
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
can you explain how that works a little
 
01:19:58.970 --> 01:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
bit yeah absolutely
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
um there was a really unfortunate
 
01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.390 align:start position:0%
um there was a really unfortunate
incident

01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
incident
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
um that occurred in 2013-2014 where a
 
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
young boy was shot and killed during a
 
01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
supervised visitation and that resulted
 
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
in the formation of Joshua's Law and I'd
 
01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
be happy to talk more about that history
 
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
um at a later date but
 
01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
um basically Joshua's Law resulted in
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
applying a fee to domestic violence
 
01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
cases and that goes into a special fund
 
01:20:28.010 --> 01:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
that crisis centers get I think it's
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
about forty thousand dollars that gets
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
split across the crisis centers and that
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
is really critical funding in terms of
 
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
providing the like it's um flexible so a
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
lot of times it goes to
 
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
um you know Medical Care are so really
 
01:20:46.729 --> 01:20:46.739 align:start position:0%
allows crisis centers to meet the direct
 
01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
needs of survivors that may not be
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
available and more restricted funding
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
from our federal federal grants um so
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
like replacing locks on doors um
 
01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
transportation like maybe someone's car
 
01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
needs to be serviced and they so that
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
they can you know get to work on
 
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
providing child care emergency dental
 
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
work is unfortunately something that we
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
see a lot and so on so Joshua's Law is a
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
really key resource and I um we have a
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
little bit more information in terms of
 
01:21:19.490 --> 01:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
like the variety of services so I'd be
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
happy to share that with you so you can
 
01:21:23.930 --> 01:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
see sort of why it is so important
 
01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
um that yeah that's something that
 
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
started in in 2014 and we are able to
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
use today okay great
 
01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
um I actually work at a transitional
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
shelter it's in Massachusetts as well um
 
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
so sometimes we do have people who come
 
01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
who are in domestic violence situation
 
01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious especially you know the
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
way that you were talking about this is
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
a holistic issue and it interests with a
 
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
variety of different things it
 
01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
absolutely intersects with
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
um housing and so I was wondering if you
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
could just kind of give some insight
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
onto the availability of shelters are
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
they placed are people placed in um you
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
know a shelter like mine which is a
 
01:22:05.689 --> 01:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
transitional shelter that is available
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
for that or
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
um you know but does not focus
 
01:22:10.729 --> 01:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
specifically on that
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
um are there you know is there is there
 
01:22:14.689 --> 01:22:14.699 align:start position:0%
availability of specifically domestic
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
violence shelters and I just wanted to
 
01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
know kind of how that intersects with
 
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
housing and of course we're having you
 
01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:22.739 align:start position:0%
know shelter beds are short as well yeah
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much for your question
 
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
I'm just gonna flip some stats
 
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
um so we like I mentioned so we have 12
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
crisis centers but we have 11 shelters
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
um the reason being is one of our crisis
 
01:22:35.209 --> 01:22:35.219 align:start position:0%
centers is co-located at the University
 
01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and so we don't have a
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
shelter located there but they partner
 
01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:40.550 align:start position:0%
shelter located there but they partner
with

01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
um Haven which is the the closest crisis
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
center to them should that be a need
 
01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and so our shelters are emergency
 
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
shelter so really anyone who is in
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
imminent danger really fleeing violence
 
01:22:53.159 --> 01:22:54.290 align:start position:0%
imminent danger really fleeing violence
um however

01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
um however
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
um if the shelter is full
 
01:23:00.649 --> 01:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
um I want to say there are a hundred and
 
01:23:03.649 --> 01:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
there are 138 beds available across the
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
state and like I mentioned we shelter
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
around 400 adults and children every
 
01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:08.810 align:start position:0%
around 400 adults and children every
year

01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
um and or who are in shelter and I think
 
01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
there's kind of a lot of things so I
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
definitely love to talk more with you
 
01:23:17.689 --> 01:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
about it because it's kind of a deep
 
01:23:17.699 --> 01:23:19.070 align:start position:0%
about it because it's kind of a deep
issue

01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
um but I think the key thing is when
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
someone is an emergency shelter the
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
immediate next step is to try to see how
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
we can support them in accessing
 
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
transitional or permanent housing so
 
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
that we can make sure that more people
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
can cycle through the shelter as needed
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
so we have our transitional housing
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
program and our rapid rehousing program
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
and we're also part of the the Bureau of
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
housing supports continue of Continuum
 
01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
of Care so we do a lot of work across
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
the state to look at different housing
 
01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.950 align:start position:0%
the state to look at different housing
options

01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
options
 
01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
um and just making that available I
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
think again there are Emergency Shelters
 
01:23:58.729 --> 01:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
so there may be
 
01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
um a domestic violence victim who has
 
01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
been removed from that um situation and
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
maybe like several years down the road
 
01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:08.219 align:start position:0%
may have access to a a non-emergency
 
01:24:08.219 --> 01:24:09.770 align:start position:0%
may have access to a a non-emergency
shelter

01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
shelter
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
um but I'd be happy to talk more about
 
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
those Dynamics and because it's a really
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
oh representative Reed
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
so I've been hearing that there's a
 
01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.659 --> 01:24:32.330 align:start position:0%
 
Department

01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
yeah no thank you for that question I'm
 
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
sorry the and I can't see you very well
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
but um so to
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
um kind of address that really quickly
 
01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
um there actually is now a tracking
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
system so the the sexual assault
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
Advisory board and the state lab worked
 
01:24:58.490 --> 01:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
on uh getting a grant to help sort of
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
expedite that process and now all new
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
kits um it started with a pilot program
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
in certain hospitals but now Statewide
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
they're slowly rolling out all kits that
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
will have a USB code on it
 
01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
um so that they can track
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
um the kit process and have a better
 
01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
ability to make sure that things are
 
01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
moving through the system and I know
 
01:25:18.169 --> 01:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
that they've made significant progress
 
01:25:19.729 --> 01:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
on that backlog
 
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
um and so again like um I think it's
 
01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
kind of a complex issue so I'd be happy
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
to chat with you more about that and
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
just give you a little bit more insight
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a couple of quick
 
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
questions you spoke of a handout
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
will that have something I don't know
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
about the same program is that it
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
referred to in your handout um I didn't
 
01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:53.450 align:start position:0%
referred to in your handout um I didn't
include

01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
I'd sure like it the other the other
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
question is more General are you a
 
01:25:59.810 --> 01:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
growth industry or are is this
 
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
increasing or are we getting a
 
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
getting this problem under control this
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
is very your presentation is very
 
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
discouraging sorry
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's a great question and
 
01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have a
 
01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
straightforward answer
 
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
um we um
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that the commission
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission is also trying
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
to look at is our Statewide data and
 
01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.430 align:start position:0%
to look at is our Statewide data and
tracking

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
tracking
 
01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.149 align:start position:0%
tracking
um

01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
systems right now a lot of that isn't
 
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
um collaborative so I know what like the
 
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
number of victims that we serve through
 
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
our crisis centers and that's the
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
picture that I have but unfortunately we
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a full picture on the true
 
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
scope of it because
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
um as much as we wish every everyone
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
would come to our crisis center is that
 
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
unfortunately isn't the case so we only
 
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
serve probably unfortunately a small
 
01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:53.219 align:start position:0%
portion of those who really need
 
01:26:53.219 --> 01:26:54.830 align:start position:0%
portion of those who really need
Services

01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
um and so um and that's why you all can
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
be a great help in making sure that
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
folks get referred um to your local
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
crisis center um but I think that's
 
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
that's an issue that the commission is
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
really trying to tackle to get a better
 
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
sense of the full scope of the issue I
 
01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:10.139 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of things that we
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
have made significant progress on and a
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
lot of that is due to the laws and
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
protocols that have been established
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
with support of this committee and the
 
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.310 align:start position:0%
with support of this committee and the
legislature

01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
um but I think then you know there's
 
01:27:22.729 --> 01:27:22.739 align:start position:0%
always more work that unfortunately
 
01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
needs to be done in terms of raising
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
awareness and identifying these issues
 
01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:30.110 align:start position:0%
awareness and identifying these issues
yep

01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
you're pretty good
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
very informative thank you very much for
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
joining us today
 
01:27:38.209 --> 01:27:38.219 align:start position:0%
uh so we
 
01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:39.050 align:start position:0%
uh so we
um

01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
I've had a couple of people ask if we
 
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
could just take five minutes so we're
 
01:27:44.209 --> 01:27:44.219 align:start position:0%
going to recess for for five minutes and
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
then whenever we come back we are going
 
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
to hear from commissioner Hanks
 
01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:49.850 align:start position:0%

01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.510 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Helen Hanks I am
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:07.860 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections I've had the
 
01:35:10.490 --> 01:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
privilege to be in state service I'm in
 
01:35:12.010 --> 01:35:12.020 align:start position:0%
my 20th year
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
I was honored to be nominated as
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner in November of 2017 and
 
01:35:18.729 --> 01:35:18.739 align:start position:0%
served a four-year term and was
 
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
re-nominated and confirmed in October of
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
2021. I share that with you because I
 
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
think it gives you a depth of awareness
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
of my time with the department and that
 
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
I spent most of the beginnings of my
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
career managing the medical and forensic
 
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
services that we deliver across the
 
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
department and then changed that role in
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
2014 when I was the assistant
 
01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.030 align:start position:0%
2014 when I was the assistant
commissioner

01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:35:46.729 --> 01:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
uh there will be a con constant theme
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
you've heard this morning at least from
 
01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary to the department our
 
01:35:53.209 --> 01:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
number one challenge at the agency is
 
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
Staffing remains to be Staffing
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
primarily our Corrections Officers but
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
also our nursing staff and our mental
 
01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:03.659 align:start position:0%
health clinicians I've provided a
 
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint that should be each of your
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
locations and we'll send that out
 
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
electronically as well and advise you
 
01:36:12.129 --> 01:36:12.139 align:start position:0%
that our last published annual report of
 
01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
fy21 is a robust document that is
 
01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:17.699 align:start position:0%
intended to tell you a lot more than I
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
can tell you in the time that I'll have
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
here with you today specifically in the
 
01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:24.179 align:start position:0%
diversity of treatment and programming
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
and other data points that you may find
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
relevant and if you don't find it in
 
01:36:30.649 --> 01:36:30.659 align:start position:0%
there to my right is Jane Graham our
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
departmental legislative liaison and
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
she'll help and I will help navigate
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
your request and we'll make sure you
 
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
have our contact information
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
we rebranded our vision as an agency on
 
01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
the first page of the PowerPoint because
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
they think it's important that our goal
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
is to have a fully staffed Workforce
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
where everyone is professionally
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
developed and yes we do expect that
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who are in our care and
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
custody are provided an opportunity for
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
Progressive Rehabilitation and we do
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
want state-of-the-art facilities in in
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
order to do that
 
01:37:05.209 --> 01:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
on the following page I provide really
 
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
just some images of the different
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
facilities that we run I do want to make
 
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
it clear for members the Department of
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
Corrections the New Hampshire Department
 
01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
of Corrections does not have oversight
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
of the county jails those are distinctly
 
01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
managed by each County and they have a
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
county superintendent and a county
 
01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
delegation so if you have a County Jail
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
question please see your county and they
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
will assist you the county
 
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
superintendents do have an association
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
and superintendent Chris Brackett is
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
their currently elected president and
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure he can assist in your county
 
01:37:37.129 --> 01:37:37.139 align:start position:0%
jail questions
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
I cannot
 
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh the New Hampshire state prison for
 
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
men which is our largest facilities here
 
01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:45.860 align:start position:0%
in Concord its foundation is as old as
 
01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:48.370 align:start position:0%
in Concord its foundation is as old as
1878.

01:37:48.370 --> 01:37:48.380 align:start position:0%
1878.
 
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
1878. that is an important number we ask
 
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
every year for a significant portion of
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
the capital budget appropriation to
 
01:37:58.610 --> 01:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
maintain that facility it is designed in
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
a campus style format it is the least
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
efficient format to manage in a
 
01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
correctional facility it is a challenge
 
01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:07.139 align:start position:0%
with our challenge in Staffing it is a
 
01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
challenge just based on the age of the
 
01:38:11.209 --> 01:38:11.219 align:start position:0%
infrastructure I don't want to take away
 
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
there is some really interesting
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
Correctional infrastructure there and
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
yes if we're fortunate enough My Hope Is
 
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
that you will support in building a new
 
01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
facility we can turn it into a museum
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
because there are sections that
 
01:38:26.689 --> 01:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
definitely belong in a museum
 
01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
especially the rats
 
01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:29.810 align:start position:0%
especially the rats
um

01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
we built a new facility for women we had
 
01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
leased a facility in Goffstown we were
 
01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
fortunate to move into that facility in
 
01:38:39.649 --> 01:38:39.659 align:start position:0%
April of 2018 with final construction
 
01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
elements that occurred and were
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
completed that literally the Public
 
01:38:48.169 --> 01:38:48.179 align:start position:0%
Works checklist in 2019 all of these
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
facilities we would certainly open up a
 
01:38:52.669 --> 01:38:52.679 align:start position:0%
tour opportunity to any member of the
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
legislature we will put you through a
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
criminal background check and other
 
01:38:57.890 --> 01:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
elements that we put everyone through so
 
01:38:59.330 --> 01:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
bear with us as we go through that
 
01:39:01.570 --> 01:39:01.580 align:start position:0%
process we run prisons
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have three transitional housing units
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
that are one is in Manchester two are
 
01:39:10.129 --> 01:39:10.139 align:start position:0%
here in Concord one of the facilities in
 
01:39:12.169 --> 01:39:12.179 align:start position:0%
Concord is dedicated to women and we
 
01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
have one transitional work center for
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
men here in Concord the transitional
 
01:39:18.649 --> 01:39:18.659 align:start position:0%
work Center for Women was built on the
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
campus of the new correctional facility
 
01:39:23.689 --> 01:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
for women and again I think seeing the
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
Men's prison first and the women's
 
01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
prison last will give you a good sense
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the differences in Correctional
 
01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:30.649 align:start position:0%
of the differences in Correctional
design

01:39:30.649 --> 01:39:30.659 align:start position:0%
design
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
on the following page I just I think
 
01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
it's important we've had these
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
conversations with previous members of
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature and I will expect that
 
01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
new members of the legislature will ask
 
01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
these questions going forward to give
 
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
you a base information of the
 
01:39:45.010 --> 01:39:45.020 align:start position:0%
self-reported it is self-reported race
 
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
collected at a time of booking it is
 
01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
mostly a group of white Caucasian
 
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
individuals incarcerated in our
 
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
facilities our census in the prisons
 
01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
on the following page we incarcerate
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
mostly biological men sorry men in the
 
01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.330 align:start position:0%
mostly biological men sorry men in the
room

01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
um 93 of the people incarcerated are
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
males uh biological males in the state
 
01:40:12.530 --> 01:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire our census for women
 
01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
was as low as I think it was a hundred
 
01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:15.770 align:start position:0%
was as low as I think it was a hundred
yesterday

01:40:15.770 --> 01:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
um and we built the facility that I
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
referenced to the capacity of 224. at
 
01:40:22.729 --> 01:40:22.739 align:start position:0%
the time that that facility was
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
authorized through the capital budget
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation process there was a plan
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we could increase the
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
capacity there and I'm happy that we
 
01:40:33.169 --> 01:40:33.179 align:start position:0%
have never had to come back and ask to
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
increase the capacity at that women's
 
01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
prison and and hence we're using half of
 
01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:38.629 align:start position:0%
prison and and hence we're using half of
it

01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
on the following page I give you and I
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
can provide these by gender I did it as
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
a higher overview cognizant that we
 
01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a lot of time I could
 
01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
spend probably eight hours just giving
 
01:40:50.689 --> 01:40:50.699 align:start position:0%
you a historical education a current
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
educational Corrections it is my passion
 
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
but these are the age ranges of the
 
01:40:57.530 --> 01:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
people uh the adults that are under our
 
01:40:58.850 --> 01:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
care and custody and you'll see that
 
01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
mostly they're between the ages of 30
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
and 49.
 
01:41:05.930 --> 01:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
we do not have any uh adjudicated minors
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
those adjudicated minors would be in the
 
01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
care and custody of the Youth Detention
 
01:41:11.689 --> 01:41:11.699 align:start position:0%
Center until they turned the age of 18
 
01:41:13.729 --> 01:41:13.739 align:start position:0%
at which time we would take over custody
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
of them because of the prison rape
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
elimination act that came from the
 
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
federal government we did change the law
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
to assure we were compliant with that I
 
01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
do want you to know that term prison
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
rape elimination act because as a
 
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
correctional agency we have to pass an
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
audit of three sites every year if we do
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
not we affect the state's ability to
 
01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
receive Federal grant funding so we take
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
that charge seriously and have passed
 
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:37.139 align:start position:0%
our audit and we like to tell the state
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
of New Jersey we were the first to pass
 
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
the federal prison rape elimination act
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
when it started uh I think it was 2016
 
01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
and we're still in a debate with New
 
01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:47.330 align:start position:0%
and we're still in a debate with New
Jersey

01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
Jersey
 
01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
which we will win on The Following pages
 
01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
are the basic crime breakouts if I gave
 
01:41:56.090 --> 01:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
you a chart of all of the RSA violations
 
01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
it would simply tell you that one-third
 
01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
of the men in New Hampshire who are
 
01:42:01.609 --> 01:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
incarcerated adult males are
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for violations associated
 
01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
with sex sexual assault aggravated
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
sexual assault felonious sexual assault
 
01:42:10.010 --> 01:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
one-third of the population of men
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in New Hampshire fit that
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
fit that criteria they're in the section
 
01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
of the 64 percent personal uh personal
 
01:42:20.689 --> 01:42:20.699 align:start position:0%
includes violent also in that largest
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
blue bar on that Circle are attempted
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
murder murder things of that nature
 
01:42:29.290 --> 01:42:29.300 align:start position:0%
those violent volatile crimes
 
01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
approximately 600 people are
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
incarcerated associated with violations
 
01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
under the controlled Drug Act so when
 
01:42:38.330 --> 01:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
our partners the Judiciary were talking
 
01:42:40.209 --> 01:42:40.219 align:start position:0%
about mental health courts the other
 
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
implementation of Statewide drug court
 
01:42:45.290 --> 01:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
has made a large and positive impact on
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
reducing individuals incarceration
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
associated with substance use disorder
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
as well as their mental health courts
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
with individuals with severe and
 
01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
persistent mental illness so we love
 
01:42:57.410 --> 01:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
drug court the department loves mental
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
health court and I know there are a few
 
01:43:02.090 --> 01:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
veterans courts and we greatly
 
01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
appreciate those opportunities that the
 
01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
Judiciary has created to divert people
 
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
from incarceration if it's safe for
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
Public Safety
 
01:43:12.169 --> 01:43:12.179 align:start position:0%
on the following slide I think another
 
01:43:14.450 --> 01:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
important area is to talk about the
 
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
population of those incarcerated New
 
01:43:19.850 --> 01:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been proactive proactive
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
as far back as 2014 and we've seen a 26
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
percent decline in the incarcerated
 
01:43:27.050 --> 01:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
population in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:43:29.450 --> 01:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
the adult population and that is because
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
of the things they just referenced the
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
implementation of state right why drug
 
01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:36.179 align:start position:0%
court looking at mental illness as a
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
root of the criminogenic behavior and
 
01:43:40.609 --> 01:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
can there be other Alternatives that can
 
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
be safely managed through whether it's
 
01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
probation diversion in general or other
 
01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
opportunities if it is again at the
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
advantage of of it doesn't affect uh
 
01:43:53.209 --> 01:43:53.219 align:start position:0%
adversely excuse me Public Safety Public
 
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
Safety is the most important aspect and
 
01:43:58.010 --> 01:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
if it can't be managed that way then the
 
01:43:59.570 --> 01:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
sentence structure will result in an
 
01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
we are also thankful that the population
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
decreased because our staffing decreased
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
and we were able to shut down the second
 
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
floor of a large general population
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
housing unit back in July of 2021 that
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
reduced our post requirements at the
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
Men's prison by 14. that's significant
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
we also shut down a 56 bed general
 
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
population unit at Women's and reduced
 
01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
that security post requirement by five
 
01:44:30.649 --> 01:44:30.659 align:start position:0%
daily so you add that over time without
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
those reductions with the reduction of
 
01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:36.179 align:start position:0%
our staffing we've had a very
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
challenging last several years
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
on the following slide after the
 
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
population reduction I I did show you on
 
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
purpose the population by maximum
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
sentence because in New Hampshire we
 
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
have a minimum sentence and a maximum
 
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
sentence that minimum sentence minimum
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
parole release date is never a guarantee
 
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
but this maximum is a guarantee
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
the DV the part I footnote at the bottom
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
is it doesn't account for people's
 
01:45:03.649 --> 01:45:03.659 align:start position:0%
consecutive sentence because someone can
 
01:45:06.169 --> 01:45:06.179 align:start position:0%
be incarcerated on multiple consecutive
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
sentences and we can't possibly
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
calculate that because we don't know
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
when they're going to achieve parole to
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't know when they're going to
 
01:45:15.169 --> 01:45:15.179 align:start position:0%
achieve parole to that consecutive
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
sentence so this is the best Snapchat we
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
can give you with some consistency and
 
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.689 --> 01:45:26.699 align:start position:0%
Staffing challenges I told you we were
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
going to talk about that on the
 
01:45:29.050 --> 01:45:29.060 align:start position:0%
following Slide
 
01:45:31.729 --> 01:45:31.739 align:start position:0%
the security vacancy rate in October was
 
01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
39 percent it's closer to 50 percent
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
today and I'm talking specifically in
 
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
the area of Corrections Officers I'm not
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
talking when I say 50 I'm not talking
 
01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
about Corporal sergeants lieutenants
 
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
captains we have a whole Rank and file
 
01:45:46.189 --> 01:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
within our organization it's Corrections
 
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
Officers I heard someone reference and I
 
01:45:50.570 --> 01:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
think it was the clerk from Concord say
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
that Amazon's offering twenty dollars an
 
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
hour the department of corrections as a
 
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
starting corrections officer offers just
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
under 22 dollars an hour when we ask
 
01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:03.659 align:start position:0%
people to work in a prison from 1878 24
 
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
hours a day with individuals who
 
01:46:07.129 --> 01:46:07.139 align:start position:0%
committed felonies a majority of them
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
sex offenders so my charges
 
01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
Commissioners try to rectify that
 
01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
minimum starting Baseline and advocate
 
01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:15.179 align:start position:0%

01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%

01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:20.340 align:start position:0%

01:46:27.649 --> 01:46:27.659 align:start position:0%
another unique area that people don't
 
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
think about corrections is really a
 
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
community of all professionals behind a
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
brick wall with razor wire we need chefs
 
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
we need clinicians we need case managers
 
01:46:40.729 --> 01:46:40.739 align:start position:0%
we need clerical support we need it just
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
as the community needs it we need
 
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
recreational therapists but we're having
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
a hard time also recruiting chefs to
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
help manage our kitchens and we're
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have residents who want to
 
01:46:52.010 --> 01:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
work in our kitchens but we do need
 
01:46:55.490 --> 01:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
chefs to help manage the quality and
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
delivery of those Food Service the other
 
01:47:00.169 --> 01:47:00.179 align:start position:0%
area that is not uncommon and many of
 
01:47:01.729 --> 01:47:01.739 align:start position:0%
you both professionally and through your
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
legislative experience is the area of
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
registered nurses and other nursing
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
disciplines we have a 27 vacancy rate in
 
01:47:10.250 --> 01:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
that area and then mental health
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
clinicians we are competing with
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%

name it we're competing with them and we

have a 38 vacancy in those positions as
 
01:47:25.679 --> 01:47:26.629 align:start position:0%
have a 38 vacancy in those positions as
well

01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:47:29.890 --> 01:47:29.900 align:start position:0%
really positive presentation I know
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
well the fortunate part for the state is
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections we
 
01:47:37.370 --> 01:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to persevere and maybe to our
 
01:47:39.410 --> 01:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
own deficit but we persevere every day
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
and I have some of the strongest most
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
dedicated Correctional staff that I
 
01:47:45.649 --> 01:47:45.659 align:start position:0%
could ask for in the state could ask for
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
so I just want to take a minute to
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate them I show you the Staffing
 
01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
Trends on the next following pages I
 
01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
break out security staff versus what we
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
call our civilian staff those other
 
01:47:57.169 --> 01:47:57.179 align:start position:0%
people not wearing the corrections
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
uniform on a daily basis and you should
 
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
you should notice on FY 22 we experience
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
like many other people experience coming
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
out of the height of covid a mass Exodus
 
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
of individuals who deservedly retired
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
they had greater than 20 plus years of
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
Correctional experience and said wow
 
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
those were the toughest two years of my
 
01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
life I'm gonna go do something else and
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
I shook their hand and thanked them for
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
their service
 
01:48:24.590 --> 01:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
we have hired to date just the update at
 
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
the end 17 corrections officer training
 
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
these that number is too small but we
 
01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
continue to persevere again in different
 
01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
unique ways than we have in the past as
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
a Corrections agency and I'll talk about
 
01:48:38.209 --> 01:48:38.219 align:start position:0%
those moving into my next slide
 
01:48:40.129 --> 01:48:40.139 align:start position:0%
so if you know somebody who's interested
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
in Corrections we will give them a tour
 
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
we will hire them if they meet the
 
01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and we will give them
 
01:48:45.649 --> 01:48:45.659 align:start position:0%
a long and enduring career so please
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
refer them to my department
 
01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
on the following slide civilian Staffing
 
01:48:52.729 --> 01:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
Trends it did the same thing in FY 22 as
 
01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
far as the retirement and really
 
01:48:57.410 --> 01:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
actually people choosing theirs was a
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
little different that column called
 
01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
termed doesn't mean we asked them to
 
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
leave it means they separated or
 
01:49:04.810 --> 01:49:04.820 align:start position:0%
terminated their relationship with us
 
01:49:07.330 --> 01:49:07.340 align:start position:0%
that demonstrates the competitive
 
01:49:10.370 --> 01:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
competitiveness of community people or
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
organizations who are recruiting our
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
employees to go work in their
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
organizations at a higher rate of pay
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
with a lot less stress than you would
 
01:49:19.129 --> 01:49:19.139 align:start position:0%
experience in a correctional environment
 
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
and we do a lot of exit interviewing so
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
we learned a lot over the last several
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
years about what we can do differently
 
01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
and what we hope to do going forward to
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
help retain people because as much as
 
01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
recruiting people is important where
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
attention as equally and critically as
 
01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:34.490 align:start position:0%
attention as equally and critically as
important

01:49:34.490 --> 01:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh the following slide shows the ratio
 
01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
of our staff's biological gender to
 
01:49:41.229 --> 01:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
their years of service
 
01:49:43.850 --> 01:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
we have really increased the number of
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
biological women who work for us I think
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
that's a benefit to creating a unique
 
01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
and equalized working environment we
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
have a very ethnically diverse work
 
01:49:55.609 --> 01:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
um work
 
01:49:57.890 --> 01:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
excuse me Staffing I just I'm very
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
impressed with the number of people who
 
01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
come and work in our agency whether
 
01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
their original origins or Russia or
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
Uganda you name it we have such a
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
wonderfully Diverse
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
Staffing Cadre so I just thought this
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
would be helpful the average years of
 
01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
service is nine and a half years at
 
01:50:16.669 --> 01:50:16.679 align:start position:0%
least it was when I ran this in October
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
that is different in my time with the
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
agency where that number had been closer
 
01:50:22.850 --> 01:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
to 15. I'm not judging that as a
 
01:50:24.530 --> 01:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
negative situation but it is nice to
 
01:50:25.729 --> 01:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
know that the average years of service
 
01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
is nine and a half years once we can get
 
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
people after that first and third year
 
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
to stay
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
recruiting events we have made numerous
 
01:50:36.890 --> 01:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
adjustments this is just a snapshot of
 
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
the places that we have gone to attempt
 
01:50:41.689 --> 01:50:41.699 align:start position:0%
to recruit people into this mystery
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
called Corrections and we go to high
 
01:50:45.590 --> 01:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
schools we go to colleges we bring them
 
01:50:48.770 --> 01:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
in we take them on tours we have created
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
a temporary full-time recruiting
 
01:50:53.209 --> 01:50:53.219 align:start position:0%
Sergeant for their for our whole
 
01:50:54.530 --> 01:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
organization we're going to increase
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
that to two we do think that and found
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
that getting our faces out there to talk
 
01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
about what Corrections is what it isn't
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
we are not a reality TV show we are much
 
01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:04.810 align:start position:0%
we are not a reality TV show we are much
more

01:51:04.810 --> 01:51:04.820 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
polished professional and interesting
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
than that and then I think it was
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
important to also show you that our
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
source of hire is generally our staff or
 
01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
other state employees that's been
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
helpful to know and that our recruitment
 
01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
team is drawing in about two percent and
 
01:51:22.129 --> 01:51:22.139 align:start position:0%
that's a new initiative so that's a new
 
01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
slice of the pie we weren't aware of if
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
you don't follow us we're probably on
 
01:51:27.770 --> 01:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
every social media you could possibly
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
imagine even ones I didn't know existed
 
01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
but now I do so good for me
 
01:51:34.250 --> 01:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
um and we published numerous things both
 
01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
to recognize our staff unique things
 
01:51:38.090 --> 01:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
about corrections and programs and
 
01:51:39.290 --> 01:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing within the
 
01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
agency so I would suggest just follow us
 
01:51:44.689 --> 01:51:44.699 align:start position:0%
it'll be interesting I promise you
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
um we talked I talked a lot about what
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
happens or at least our incarcerated
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
population but the other part of the
 
01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
agency is the division of field services
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
that is our probation and parole
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
Services probation is time served on
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
probation parole is time served after
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
you've achieved your privilege of
 
01:52:04.010 --> 01:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
release on your minimum sentence those
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
are the two distinct differences if you
 
01:52:07.729 --> 01:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
violate probation that time on probation
 
01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:09.719 align:start position:0%
does not count toward the sentence of
 
01:52:13.010 --> 01:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
violation of paration you start again
 
01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
um the area of field services is also a
 
01:52:17.090 --> 01:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
collections agency so if you didn't know
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections has a
 
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
collections agency and we collect the
 
01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
court fines and restitution associated
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
with felony level crime as well as
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
obligations Financial Obligations that
 
01:52:28.669 --> 01:52:28.679 align:start position:0%
people incur through the destruction of
 
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
state property during their incarcerated
 
01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:31.450 align:start position:0%
state property during their incarcerated
stay

01:52:31.450 --> 01:52:31.460 align:start position:0%
stay
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
the probation and parole team also
 
01:52:36.169 --> 01:52:36.179 align:start position:0%
supervises interstate compact agreement
 
01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
so if you did not know almost all 50
 
01:52:40.970 --> 01:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
states are part of a federal commission
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
that actually allows people to transfer
 
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
their supervision after application and
 
01:52:47.689 --> 01:52:47.699 align:start position:0%
vetting by the receiving state to have
 
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
their parole supervised and generally it
 
01:52:52.729 --> 01:52:52.739 align:start position:0%
was their home state so most people do
 
01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
not receive the opportunity to have
 
01:52:57.530 --> 01:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
their Supervision in New Hampshire if
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
they're applying from another state if
 
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
they do not have a grounded family or
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
support system in our state that's
 
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
square one of the application process
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
and administrative home confinement is a
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
form of privileged incarceration at home
 
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
with GPS monitoring that goes through
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
the statutory process that starts
 
01:53:18.890 --> 01:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
um evaluating if they've done
 
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative programming if they have
 
01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
an appropriate housing situation and
 
01:53:24.649 --> 01:53:24.659 align:start position:0%
supports they have the likelihood of
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
attaining a job or have a job offer and
 
01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
or are enrolled in an educational
 
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
program then I will recommend them for
 
01:53:32.930 --> 01:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement and that
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation goes before the
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
sentencing judge and the sentencing
 
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
judge and the prosecuting attorney and
 
01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
defense attorney have time by Statute to
 
01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:44.100 align:start position:0%
comment before the ultimately affirming
 
01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
my recommendation or declining it we've
 
01:53:50.090 --> 01:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
used that in the highest point 33 cases
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
I think we have nine people today out on
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement it's not
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
a highly used form of release
 
01:53:59.570 --> 01:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
primarily because housing is an issue
 
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
finding appropriate housing and stable
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
housing is a barrier to the use of
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement as a fun
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
fact I will let you know that the
 
01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on Alcohol and
 
01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs
 
01:54:14.209 --> 01:54:14.219 align:start position:0%
funded a housing program for the
 
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and Corrections and Drug Court
 
01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
participants it's a fun fact because
 
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's strange that the Judiciary is
 
01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:22.199 align:start position:0%
running a housing program for
 
01:54:23.890 --> 01:54:23.900 align:start position:0%
Corrections and Drug Court participants
 
01:54:26.689 --> 01:54:26.699 align:start position:0%
and was nationally recognized in a drug
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
court conference across the country and
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
other states are now looking at that
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
program and through the support of the
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
lead Rachel who is over at the Judiciary
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
she's helped house over 400 people
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
post-release from incarceration or
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
participating in drug court and that's
 
01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
really important because those 400
 
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
people could have ended back at the
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
prison and we really don't want people
 
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
to come back
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
the field services caseloid as our
 
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
incarcerated population has also been
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
decreasing so that's what the following
 
01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
slide starts to show you the blue line
 
01:55:02.689 --> 01:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
is probation so the most number of
 
01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
people out on Community Supervision is
 
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
probation that orange line is parole
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
supervision you're going to see new
 
01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
elements in the FY 22 and um and FY 23
 
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
and those are to denote the inclusion of
 
01:55:20.090 --> 01:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
fugitives people who have absconded from
 
01:55:22.729 --> 01:55:22.739 align:start position:0%
supervision the other bar graphs going
 
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
back further they're embedded in either
 
01:55:26.450 --> 01:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
probation or parole and we really wanted
 
01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
to give a clean lens on who we're
 
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
supervising in New Hampshire that we
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
know where they are and that we know we
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
don't know where some people are simply
 
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
said and you'll see that conversation I
 
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
had about administrative home
 
01:55:38.450 --> 01:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
confinement that's the smallest number
 
01:55:40.850 --> 01:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
across those years
 
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
and then the New Hampshire
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
non-supervised is that interstate
 
01:55:45.290 --> 01:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
compact conversation I had with you a
 
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
moment ago
 
01:55:49.070 --> 01:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
so good things are happening we're using
 
01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
less of the incarcerated system and less
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the supervision system in New
 
01:55:54.290 --> 01:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we have to be doing
 
01:55:56.209 --> 01:55:56.219 align:start position:0%
something right now I haven't done the
 
01:55:57.770 --> 01:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
full analysis and it would be
 
01:55:59.330 --> 01:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
interesting to do one to see what have
 
01:56:00.890 --> 01:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
we been doing right over the last 10
 
01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
years above and beyond what I stated
 
01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
because we are doing something right we
 
01:56:07.010 --> 01:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
do several things right but it's
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
happening also in this area on the
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
following slide when I when I took on
 
01:56:13.250 --> 01:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of commissioner I
 
01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
include this slide as simple as Vehicles
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
because as simple as vehicles our agency
 
01:56:19.729 --> 01:56:19.739 align:start position:0%
needs the resources to do the things
 
01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
I've talked about and our probation and
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
parole officers have been under
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
outfitted with vehicles so I've spent
 
01:56:27.530 --> 01:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
from 2017 to today within our existing
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
budget to increase their Fleet from 19
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
to 23. and it may not seem like a lot
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
but it is enough it's and it's going to
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
keep heading in that direction because
 
01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
you can't send people out in the
 
01:56:39.590 --> 01:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
community to supervise if you don't have
 
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
a vehicle to go do it in
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's just reality the other thing I
 
01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
started working on is actually
 
01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
increasing their caseload and you'll see
 
01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
on the narrative on the car slide I talk
 
01:56:52.729 --> 01:56:52.739 align:start position:0%
about not increasing their caseload
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
increasing the staff to facilitate their
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
caseload so in the budgeting process
 
01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
um in 18 I asked for four new probation
 
01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
parole officers I was fortunate to
 
01:57:06.169 --> 01:57:06.179 align:start position:0%
attain uh two and we deployed those to
 
01:57:08.209 --> 01:57:08.219 align:start position:0%
equalize the ratio of Probation and
 
01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
Parole offices to the cases that they
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
were managing in looking at the agency's
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
vacancy because in the next budgeting
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
phase it really wasn't a time to ask for
 
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
new staff so I looked at our existing
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
long-term vacancies and made a decision
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
to use the Personnel process to take
 
01:57:25.370 --> 01:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
those vacancies and turn those into
 
01:57:27.169 --> 01:57:27.179 align:start position:0%
additional probation and parole officers
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
so what you'll see is the ratio
 
01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
adjustments that occurred on the
 
01:57:32.930 --> 01:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
following slide deck to help create us
 
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
more in line with the National Institute
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
of Corrections standards for probation
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
and parole supervision so we're making
 
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
strides in the right direction so that
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
we have proper supervision levels out in
 
01:57:44.450 --> 01:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
the community
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
and then recidivism if that is a new
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
word for you it is a fancy word to say
 
01:57:51.169 --> 01:57:51.179 align:start position:0%
that three years after their release
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
from incarceration they came back to New
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire incarceration we don't like
 
01:57:57.649 --> 01:57:57.659 align:start position:0%
high recidivism numbers but we have to
 
01:57:58.970 --> 01:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
understand what they are if we're going
 
01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
to make a difference in helping people
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
stay in New Hampshire communities
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
so if you look at 2018 from 2017
 
01:58:09.649 --> 01:58:09.659 align:start position:0%
there are things we know were going on
 
01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and that
 
01:58:14.209 --> 01:58:14.219 align:start position:0%
is the opioid epidemic our individuals
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
are affected by substance use disorder
 
01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
at a higher rate than the average
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
neighbor citizen person in New Hampshire
 
01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:23.639 align:start position:0%
and we saw the rate for men increase
 
01:58:25.729 --> 01:58:25.739 align:start position:0%
significantly as far as recidivism in
 
01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
2018 because that's three years after
 
01:58:31.250 --> 01:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
they left so they left in 2018 when we
 
01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
watched them for three years after that
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
you might ask me commissioner why did
 
01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
the women's number not go up why did it
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
go down we were fortunate to receive
 
01:58:41.930 --> 01:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
state opioid response dollars from our
 
01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
partners at Health and Human Services to
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
deploy a pilot project and that project
 
01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
was to partner people voluntarily
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
post-release with what we coined a
 
01:58:53.089 --> 01:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
re-entry care coordinator and they
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
followed women who had opioid use
 
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
disorder one year post-release and
 
01:58:59.930 --> 01:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
functioned as I would equate it to a
 
01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
health care Navigator a navigator to
 
01:59:03.530 --> 01:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
remove barriers and help them connect to
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
whatever resources are going to help
 
01:59:06.649 --> 01:59:06.659 align:start position:0%
stabilize them in the community whether
 
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's treatment provider were they having
 
01:59:10.490 --> 01:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
challenges with housing do we need to
 
01:59:12.890 --> 01:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
help have navigate daycare and it made
 
01:59:14.570 --> 01:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
them it made a difference and it
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
continued to make a difference so in
 
01:59:19.070 --> 01:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
2019 we were provided an opportunity to
 
01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
add two more re-entry care coordinators
 
01:59:23.629 --> 01:59:23.639 align:start position:0%
through the same funding for men so as I
 
01:59:25.129 --> 01:59:25.139 align:start position:0%
continue to look at our recidivism
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
numbers I expect that number to be
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
better but we are still challenged with
 
01:59:31.609 --> 01:59:31.619 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and its impacts
 
01:59:33.649 --> 01:59:33.659 align:start position:0%
on individuals who were supervising out
 
01:59:35.689 --> 01:59:35.699 align:start position:0%
in the community and the small little
 
01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
chart below I'll send this to you
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
electronically so you can read tiny
 
01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
little writing underneath
 
01:59:42.290 --> 01:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
are the hearings outcome from our Adult
 
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
Parole Board I'll also take this
 
01:59:45.770 --> 01:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to tell you I do not
 
01:59:47.570 --> 01:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
supervise the adult parole award The
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
Adult Parole Board is managed out of the
 
01:59:51.229 --> 01:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
governor's office and is a separate
 
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
partner for the agency to Nutri as a
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
neutral party to examine the
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities to Grant privileges of
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
parole or violations of parole and in
 
02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
their review of cases the bar chart
 
02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
underneath shows that the reasons people
 
02:00:06.890 --> 02:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
violate parole in the top three are
 
02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
issues associated with drug and alcohol
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
use so I don't think that should be
 
02:00:12.649 --> 02:00:12.659 align:start position:0%
surprising but it's an area we have to
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
continue to Target and then the third
 
02:00:17.149 --> 02:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
rule violation has to do with unstable
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
housing unstable employment and moving
 
02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
throughout the state it's all it's
 
02:00:23.870 --> 02:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
almost always a combination of these
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
rule violations it's not generally just
 
02:00:29.149 --> 02:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
one if it is generally just one it's
 
02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
because they've engaged in actual
 
02:00:32.589 --> 02:00:32.599 align:start position:0%
additional criminal
 
02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
criminal contact or criminal engagement
 
02:00:36.169 --> 02:00:36.179 align:start position:0%
in the community and they've been
 
02:00:36.179 --> 02:00:37.729 align:start position:0%
in the community and they've been
arrested

02:00:37.729 --> 02:00:37.739 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
02:00:42.169 --> 02:00:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:43.729 --> 02:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
what I would hope you would go to the
 
02:00:45.169 --> 02:00:45.179 align:start position:0%
annual report and learn more about but
 
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
here's a little snapshot of pictures of
 
02:00:48.410 --> 02:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
things we've done to implement new
 
02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:50.219 align:start position:0%
programming called Choose Love we've
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
taken what's been deployed in our our
 
02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
school systems in New Hampshire worked
 
02:00:57.290 --> 02:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
with the partners to afford it um and
 
02:00:59.570 --> 02:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
equal it to an adult learning curricula
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
and it's been well received and made a
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
really wonderful impact with women we
 
02:01:05.570 --> 02:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
started with women first and now we've
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
deployed it to our men's programming
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
gives you an a summary ctec is our
 
02:01:13.010 --> 02:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education center we
 
02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
are part of the correctional
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
organizations who have been approved and
 
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
have partners for the reauthorization of
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
the second chance Pell grant that will
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
start in July 1 our Technical Community
 
02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
Partners are White Mountain Community
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
College and nhti here in Concord so
 
02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
we'll continue down that road
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
I only have two more to go victim
 
02:01:33.649 --> 02:01:33.659 align:start position:0%
services but you didn't know we had a
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
victim Services Bureau but we do we
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
support uh victims and survivors of
 
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
felony level crime here in New Hampshire
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
and this is a summary we are on the cusp
 
02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
of deploying and being part of the vine
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
automated notification system that many
 
02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
of our County Jail Partners have already
 
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
had we did that through our federal
 
02:01:54.169 --> 02:01:54.179 align:start position:0%
funding for victim services so that will
 
02:01:56.450 --> 02:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
be moving forward and making it really a
 
02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
self-service model how you want to be
 
02:01:59.450 --> 02:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
notified about that person who's
 
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
affected your life email phone call text
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
you name it if you want a hard copy
 
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
letter you'll still get that and the
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
following slide is to give you a sense
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
in one month there are thousands of
 
02:02:13.609 --> 02:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
individuals who are supporting whether
 
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's supporting through victim our
 
02:02:18.290 --> 02:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
Bureau victim Services whether the
 
02:02:19.970 --> 02:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
person is incarcerated probation or
 
02:02:23.450 --> 02:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
parole so we do that across the gamut uh
 
02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
and I did put that we've collected 1.1
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars in restitution and
 
02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
obligations at the time of uh publishing
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
this PowerPoint and then on that last
 
02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:35.820 align:start position:0%

I'd be interested in talking to you
 
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
later about setting up a field trip
 
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
um for any of the members of the
 
02:03:14.689 --> 02:03:14.699 align:start position:0%
committee who would like to go and take
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
a tour and see what's going on at both
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
the men's and women's facilities so that
 
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
we have an idea and can actually see the
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
people that these laws affect and impact
 
02:03:28.609 --> 02:03:28.619 align:start position:0%
um just a couple quick questions I have
 
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
um your recruitment I noticed on the
 
02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
list of colleges you didn't have any
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
state schools do you go to UNH do you
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
have any issues with the state schools
 
02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
getting in there or anything like that
 
02:03:39.410 --> 02:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
that was just uh thank you for that
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
question that was just a short list we
 
02:03:43.609 --> 02:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
go to UNH okay you name it we're trying
 
02:03:45.890 --> 02:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
to be there we also work with our
 
02:03:47.930 --> 02:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
partners at Employment Security as well
 
02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:50.209 align:start position:0%
partners at Employment Security as well
okay

02:03:50.209 --> 02:03:50.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
um and I've asked us a couple of other
 
02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:54.300 align:start position:0%
presenters how's the homeless situation
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
in this state impacting uh I mean are
 
02:03:59.089 --> 02:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
some people not having difficulty
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
leaving the system because they have
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
nowhere to go I mean do you see people
 
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
coming into the system that are there
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
for crimes that really they just needed
 
02:04:09.290 --> 02:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
a place to live that's
 
02:04:13.970 --> 02:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh housing program we've partnered with
 
02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary has helped us on the
 
02:04:20.570 --> 02:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
helping prevent people's return but also
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
helping find stable housing because it's
 
02:04:25.850 --> 02:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
not just here's your housing for a
 
02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
couple of months and we walk away we the
 
02:04:29.689 --> 02:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
program is designed to give you housing
 
02:04:33.169 --> 02:04:33.179 align:start position:0%
and then long-term housing stability so
 
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
I think we've been really fortunate to
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
be able to Pilot and continue to receive
 
02:04:37.609 --> 02:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
funding for that program we actually
 
02:04:39.410 --> 02:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
asked for more money from the governor's
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
commission that was granted to us to
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
continue to expand that opportunity with
 
02:04:45.290 --> 02:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
that said I will tell you we do not
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
automatically violate someone's
 
02:04:49.250 --> 02:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
probation and or parole if they lose
 
02:04:51.470 --> 02:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
their housing we do not want the state
 
02:04:53.450 --> 02:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
corrections agency to be the default
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
housing we will only look to violations
 
02:04:58.609 --> 02:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
if it's associated with Public Safety
 
02:05:01.089 --> 02:05:01.099 align:start position:0%
around crime criminal activity
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
significant substance use relapse so I
 
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
can't solidly answer your other question
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
about community-based homelessness other
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
than say that the you'll see Corrections
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
at what you wouldn't expect in the
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
community I was recently at the city of
 
02:05:19.070 --> 02:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
concord's collaborative discussion on
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
homelessness specifically in Concord
 
02:05:23.089 --> 02:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
you'll see the commissioner Corrections
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
at meetings on education you'll see us
 
02:05:27.169 --> 02:05:27.179 align:start position:0%
at treatment because we have all of
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
those issues but it's a it's a
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
challenging question I mean housing is
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
hard for the person who's working every
 
02:05:35.629 --> 02:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
day not involved in the justice system
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
I agree thank you thank you any
 
02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:39.530 align:start position:0%
I agree thank you thank you any
questions

02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:05:41.689 --> 02:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
oh we have a lot okay uh representative
 
02:05:41.699 --> 02:05:44.830 align:start position:0%
oh we have a lot okay uh representative
Muse

02:05:44.830 --> 02:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:49.370 --> 02:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
I just wanted a quick update on where we
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
stand with the secure psychiatric unit
 
02:05:53.570 --> 02:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that question
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative Muse we continue to
 
02:05:58.189 --> 02:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
function under the existing statute the
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
department does operate the secure
 
02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit it is a mix of
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
individuals not mixed in their housing
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
but a mix of services for people who are
 
02:06:08.330 --> 02:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
civilly committed under specific
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
statutes and those who have exceeded our
 
02:06:13.250 --> 02:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
capacity to support them in our regular
 
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
prison environment so it's a mix of
 
02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
sentenced adults and civilly committed
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
individuals the latter that being
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
sentenced adult is actually the primary
 
02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
population we treat in the secure
 
02:06:27.169 --> 02:06:27.179 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit but we are poised to
 
02:06:29.450 --> 02:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
hand over everybody civilly committed as
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
soon as the new forensic hospital is
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
built and I don't have a clear timeline
 
02:06:35.870 --> 02:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
on when that's happening but I I do
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
think it's important to share with this
 
02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
committee the secure psychiatric unit
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Corrections runs
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
the service need for Corrections won't
 
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
go away so we'll still use that building
 
02:06:47.810 --> 02:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
and embedded in that building in a
 
02:06:49.490 --> 02:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
separate Wing is the residential
 
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
treatment unit which provides for up to
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
40 adult males opportunity for treatment
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
for their mental illness so it's a
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
complex building that will continue to
 
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
use once the forensic hospital is built
 
02:07:05.810 --> 02:07:05.820 align:start position:0%
and HHS takes that portion over I will
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
look to our partners over at HHS to send
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
you a timeline representative Muse
 
02:07:13.010 --> 02:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I just had to interject with a
 
02:07:15.530 --> 02:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
question and I forgot to ask
 
02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
um regarding the opioid crisis you get
 
02:07:22.129 --> 02:07:22.139 align:start position:0%
handed a lot of individuals who are
 
02:07:25.010 --> 02:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
currently addicted how do you deal with
 
02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:25.970 align:start position:0%
currently addicted how do you deal with
that

02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:28.669 --> 02:07:28.679 align:start position:0%
um getting them the medical help
 
02:07:30.169 --> 02:07:30.179 align:start position:0%
obviously they're going to need when
 
02:07:32.450 --> 02:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
they're coming off of these drugs how is
 
02:07:34.370 --> 02:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
that working out and the challenges
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
around that if you just could briefly
 
02:07:37.550 --> 02:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
that question that's an important
 
02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
question individuals who come uh to our
 
02:07:43.729 --> 02:07:43.739 align:start position:0%
department who upon booking our officers
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
are trained to identify but in the first
 
02:07:48.530 --> 02:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
short hours that someone's there a
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
member of our nursing team also triages
 
02:07:53.330 --> 02:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
we triage for suicidality symptoms of
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
detox things of that nature we have
 
02:07:57.470 --> 02:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
medical professionals who work for us
 
02:07:59.330 --> 02:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
who work with our nursing staff to
 
02:08:01.370 --> 02:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
provide medically monitored
 
02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
detoxification in our infirmary spaces I
 
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
want to make it clear what I say
 
02:08:07.550 --> 02:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
infirmary I am not a hospital if
 
02:08:09.410 --> 02:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
somebody needs Hospital level of care we
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
take them to the hospital but infirmary
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
is more for pre-post-op or things we can
 
02:08:15.410 --> 02:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
manage and we know we can safely manage
 
02:08:17.810 --> 02:08:17.820 align:start position:0%
in our infirmary settings so we've had
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
since prior to 2011 medically assisted
 
02:08:23.709 --> 02:08:23.719 align:start position:0%
detoxification we also have a robust
 
02:08:26.089 --> 02:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
treatment for people with opioid use
 
02:08:28.189 --> 02:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
disorder through medication we are not
 
02:08:30.290 --> 02:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
licensed to dispense methadone but we
 
02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
have all the other methods of medication
 
02:08:35.149 --> 02:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
and when we primarily use methadone it's
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
with women who are pregnant and have
 
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
opioid use disorder and we work with a
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
partnering agency to facilitate that but
 
02:08:43.850 --> 02:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
we have buprenorphine now
 
02:08:47.149 --> 02:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
trexon naloxone we do Narcan we do all
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
of those things we do the injectables
 
02:08:51.410 --> 02:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
and I've been very proud that the
 
02:08:53.930 --> 02:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
agency's been ahead of that and can we
 
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
continue to advance and I would also say
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
that the recently published federal act
 
02:09:01.609 --> 02:09:01.619 align:start position:0%
that removed the waiver requirements for
 
02:09:04.250 --> 02:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
providers and the patient caps on
 
02:09:06.410 --> 02:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
caseloads has been a game changer for
 
02:09:08.649 --> 02:09:08.659 align:start position:0%
Corrections and will really help us
 
02:09:11.149 --> 02:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
increase our capacity to treat those
 
02:09:12.910 --> 02:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
with opioid use disorder we have
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds of individuals who are
 
02:09:17.330 --> 02:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
receiving medications associated with
 
02:09:20.330 --> 02:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
treating opioid use disorder today
 
02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:23.510 align:start position:0%
treating opioid use disorder today
thanks

02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.750 --> 02:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
there we got it thank you
 
02:09:28.970 --> 02:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I have two questions if that's okay
 
02:09:32.689 --> 02:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
um so the first is that um uh Jester
 
02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
Justice Broderick has in many speeches
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
talked about how our prison system is
 
02:09:38.810 --> 02:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
probably the greatest provider of Mental
 
02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
Health Care
 
02:09:44.330 --> 02:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering whether you see a
 
02:09:47.450 --> 02:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
pathway to avoid the need for the
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
correctional system if there were better
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
access to mental health care in some
 
02:09:54.109 --> 02:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
capacity that's my first question yeah
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and I've actually
 
02:09:58.669 --> 02:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
heard him talk and and he and I talk
 
02:10:02.209 --> 02:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
frequently the department
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
says this you heard me I support Drug
 
02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
Court mental health court I expect that
 
02:10:09.169 --> 02:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
that diversion opportunity is vetted at
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
that level
 
02:10:13.010 --> 02:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
um but we also and will provide the
 
02:10:14.570 --> 02:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment for people who
 
02:10:16.669 --> 02:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
have been deemed that despite having a
 
02:10:18.169 --> 02:10:18.179 align:start position:0%
mental health disorder their
 
02:10:20.810 --> 02:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
criminogenic issues are so significant
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
they need incarceration for us we look
 
02:10:25.729 --> 02:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
to what can we do to reduce the person
 
02:10:28.609 --> 02:10:28.619 align:start position:0%
returning and then learn about other
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
things the state could Implement on that
 
02:10:32.810 --> 02:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
diversion side so with that I would also
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
share with you that actually sit on a
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
committee through the Judiciary and our
 
02:10:38.089 --> 02:10:38.099 align:start position:0%
chief justice to look at other
 
02:10:40.189 --> 02:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities that we might not be
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
exploring as a state with other
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
collaborative Partners including a
 
02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
retired Nami leader Ken Norton and
 
02:10:49.669 --> 02:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
others to say what else can we do that
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
we haven't flipped that stone over and I
 
02:10:55.070 --> 02:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
do think housing is important housing is
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
so important that we have to overcome
 
02:10:59.870 --> 02:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
that as a state-based issue
 
02:11:02.810 --> 02:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
let me ask my second okay okay
 
02:11:04.250 --> 02:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
um so my my second question actually has
 
02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
to do with housing and employment so
 
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
um to what extent do you partner
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
organizations for housing and employment
 
02:11:13.729 --> 02:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
for people who have served time for
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
felonies because I know at least in the
 
02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
county level
 
02:11:18.890 --> 02:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
finding places that are willing to
 
02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:20.330 align:start position:0%
finding places that are willing to
accept

02:11:20.330 --> 02:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
accept
 
02:11:23.089 --> 02:11:23.099 align:start position:0%
um people who serve time to either for
 
02:11:24.410 --> 02:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
employment or housing is incredibly
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
difficult that's a great question and
 
02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
again I already referenced the program
 
02:11:31.129 --> 02:11:31.139 align:start position:0%
we started in 2018 but I also on behalf
 
02:11:32.810 --> 02:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
of the governor chair the Commission on
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
mental illness and the corrections
 
02:11:36.109 --> 02:11:36.119 align:start position:0%
system and with that the New Hampshire
 
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority Rod Rob he sits on
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
that commission and a lot of things
 
02:11:41.089 --> 02:11:41.099 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that we can all
 
02:11:42.649 --> 02:11:42.659 align:start position:0%
participate in
 
02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
um whether whatever your investment is
 
02:11:46.510 --> 02:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
is on the federal restrictions around
 
02:11:49.250 --> 02:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
affordable housing that almost
 
02:11:51.530 --> 02:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
automatically exclude people from using
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
those opportunities those those are in
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
print and then there are your local
 
02:11:58.070 --> 02:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
housing regulations that the state
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't peel down into and you as
 
02:12:03.770 --> 02:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
leaders in your areas can work at a
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
local level to try to peel some of those
 
02:12:07.970 --> 02:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
back and invite us to come to your
 
02:12:10.129 --> 02:12:10.139 align:start position:0%
communities to talk about
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
what they the myths of including those
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
prevent because having people at risk
 
02:12:17.570 --> 02:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
who are homeless only makes them more at
 
02:12:17.580 --> 02:12:18.470 align:start position:0%
who are homeless only makes them more at
risk

02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
risk
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
um so there are things we can do locally
 
02:12:22.729 --> 02:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
that we have control over that remove
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
exclusions from affordable housing
 
02:12:27.290 --> 02:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
locally I'm cognizant to say that I
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
already said housing is an issue for
 
02:12:31.129 --> 02:12:31.139 align:start position:0%
people who aren't even Justice involved
 
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
so when Justice involved people are
 
02:12:35.209 --> 02:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
competing for that same housing
 
02:12:36.729 --> 02:12:36.739 align:start position:0%
who's going to win
 
02:12:38.930 --> 02:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Corrections does
 
02:12:41.149 --> 02:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
not want to run apartment buildings we
 
02:12:42.649 --> 02:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
want to stay where we belong a partner
 
02:12:43.970 --> 02:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
with the people who should be running
 
02:12:45.169 --> 02:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
those apartment buildings houses
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
townhouses I don't mean to imply that
 
02:12:48.770 --> 02:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
people coming out of Corrections should
 
02:12:50.990 --> 02:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
only be in an apartment but housing is
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
so critical
 
02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:55.689 align:start position:0%
so critical
foreign

02:12:55.689 --> 02:12:55.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
first of all I am so happy to hear you
 
02:13:00.410 --> 02:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
say that the Mad Act is a game changer
 
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
because I was one of a whole bunch of
 
02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
people who advocated for that and was
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
very happy to see that passed thank you
 
02:13:07.129 --> 02:13:07.139 align:start position:0%
part of the Omnibus
 
02:13:10.490 --> 02:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
um absolutely I'm I'm I'm going to share
 
02:13:12.890 --> 02:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
that I hope you don't mind I guess I'll
 
02:13:14.330 --> 02:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
ask right now yes
 
02:13:16.250 --> 02:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
um I also I'm a homeless Advocate I work
 
02:13:18.050 --> 02:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
at a homeless shelter a transitional
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
homeless shelter I'm sure you were
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
sitting here so you heard that before
 
02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
um what I'm curious about is you know we
 
02:13:24.970 --> 02:13:24.980 align:start position:0%
provide kind of wraparound Services
 
02:13:28.490 --> 02:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
number one is that part of the Judiciary
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
funded program the housing program
 
02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
number two uh what kind of resources uh
 
02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
wraparon services are available to
 
02:13:37.550 --> 02:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
people and I'm curious I'm sorry it's
 
02:13:40.129 --> 02:13:40.139 align:start position:0%
three-part question I guess I'm curious
 
02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
about the length of stay average length
 
02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
of stay an incarcerated stay yeah okay
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
so your three-part question I'm sorry
 
02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
that's okay a lot no I will send you a
 
02:13:52.729 --> 02:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
copy of the document that outlines what
 
02:13:54.169 --> 02:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
we do with the Judiciary because it does
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
talk in detail about the wraparound
 
02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
services and then everybody will have
 
02:13:59.149 --> 02:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
that information and I think that's also
 
02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
the reason it's been successful we the
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
agency provide case managers and other
 
02:14:07.490 --> 02:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
service individuals depending on the
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
person to help re-entry plan for
 
02:14:12.530 --> 02:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
everyone departing Corrections and I
 
02:14:14.270 --> 02:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
will also take my commissioner pitch to
 
02:14:16.189 --> 02:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
say Medicaid expansion was a game
 
02:14:19.129 --> 02:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
changer in 2014 that individuals prior
 
02:14:20.990 --> 02:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
to that leaving Corrections we wrapped
 
02:14:22.609 --> 02:14:22.619 align:start position:0%
all of these services and we're not
 
02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
cheap we're general fund Dollars around
 
02:14:26.810 --> 02:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
a person and they had no insurance
 
02:14:28.609 --> 02:14:28.619 align:start position:0%
connectivity to maintain those services
 
02:14:31.129 --> 02:14:31.139 align:start position:0%
so when authorization happened in August
 
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
of 2014 we had a pathway to continue
 
02:14:37.310 --> 02:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
people's medication we had a pathway to
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
find them a primary care provider we had
 
02:14:42.169 --> 02:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
a pathway to intervene to reduce or
 
02:14:43.850 --> 02:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
intervene and make sure people don't
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
come back to incarceration
 
02:14:48.530 --> 02:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
um so everything we can do to stabilize
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
people and I've worked with director
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
Littman Henry Littman who's our director
 
02:14:53.209 --> 02:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid
 
02:14:55.609 --> 02:14:55.619 align:start position:0%
to make sure that Justice involved
 
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
persons are still part of that
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
conversation so please reauthorize
 
02:15:01.129 --> 02:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion uh Corrections is
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
begging you to do that the other part
 
02:15:06.109 --> 02:15:06.119 align:start position:0%
that becomes important uh
 
02:15:09.050 --> 02:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
and relative to your question is the
 
02:15:10.729 --> 02:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
state requested from the federal
 
02:15:12.890 --> 02:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
government an addition in our Medicaid
 
02:15:14.930 --> 02:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
waiver this time around and it was to
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
Target Services 45 days prior to the
 
02:15:21.050 --> 02:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
date of release and those services that
 
02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
we're hoping the federal government will
 
02:15:25.729 --> 02:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
agree with us are to reduce people's use
 
02:15:27.890 --> 02:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
of emergency room services and other
 
02:15:30.169 --> 02:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
crisis Services because we're asking for
 
02:15:32.750 --> 02:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
them to cover Through Medicaid dollars
 
02:15:34.490 --> 02:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
an appointment with a peer-to-peer
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
recovery specialist an appointment with
 
02:15:39.050 --> 02:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
the First with their first primary care
 
02:15:41.810 --> 02:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
whatever that Primary Care is if it's a
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse
 
02:15:45.290 --> 02:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
practitioner or if it's their general
 
02:15:47.209 --> 02:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
practitioner we want to get that
 
02:15:49.129 --> 02:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
face-to-face started because there's one
 
02:15:51.709 --> 02:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
thing about human beings if we meet the
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
person we're supposed to go see in 30
 
02:15:55.490 --> 02:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
days we actually have this thing called
 
02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
guilt if we don't show up so that's
 
02:15:59.810 --> 02:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in the state's Medicaid
 
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
waiver it went through a lot of support
 
02:16:04.069 --> 02:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
from State partners that I didn't even
 
02:16:06.050 --> 02:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
anticipate and then the federal
 
02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
government has looked at our waiver so
 
02:16:09.290 --> 02:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
we're literally just waiting from an
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
answer from the centers of Medicaid and
 
02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
Medicare services so that's also my
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
pitch to say please reach out to our
 
02:16:17.089 --> 02:16:17.099 align:start position:0%
federal Partners ask them to support New
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's 1115 a waiver and I'll also
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
make sure you get a copy of it we're
 
02:16:24.169 --> 02:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
trying to build those bridges to reduce
 
02:16:26.089 --> 02:16:26.099 align:start position:0%
people's return and to really wrap
 
02:16:28.729 --> 02:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
services around and our expectation is
 
02:16:30.530 --> 02:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
it could happen face to face but we're
 
02:16:32.330 --> 02:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
also practical it's likely those are
 
02:16:33.770 --> 02:16:33.780 align:start position:0%
going to happen in a Telehealth type
 
02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:36.049 align:start position:0%
going to happen in a Telehealth type
encounter

02:16:36.049 --> 02:16:36.059 align:start position:0%
encounter
 
02:16:40.370 --> 02:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
third part was average like the state oh
 
02:16:43.370 --> 02:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
I almost had it thank you sir it used to
 
02:16:45.290 --> 02:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
be three and a half to seven years was
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
the average sentence structure that has
 
02:16:50.570 --> 02:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
increased a bit it's now looking more
 
02:16:53.450 --> 02:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
like it's five to ten but I'm going to
 
02:16:55.610 --> 02:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
go back to what I said before a lot of
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
that is because we have a lot of men
 
02:16:59.870 --> 02:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for violations of sexual
 
02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:01.150 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for violations of sexual
assault

02:17:01.150 --> 02:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
assault
 
02:17:03.290 --> 02:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
with that I will tell you that the
 
02:17:04.849 --> 02:17:04.859 align:start position:0%
provisions afforded people under the
 
02:17:07.610 --> 02:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
earn time Credit Law do have a positive
 
02:17:10.009 --> 02:17:10.019 align:start position:0%
rehability impact both on them and their
 
02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
sentence structure and when the judges
 
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
check the box on the sentencing Minimus
 
02:17:16.730 --> 02:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
that give them that opportunity it
 
02:17:18.169 --> 02:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
starts to adjust that minimum and
 
02:17:19.490 --> 02:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
maximum depending on the person's
 
02:17:21.290 --> 02:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
investment in real rehabilitative
 
02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:22.669 align:start position:0%
investment in real rehabilitative
programming

02:17:22.669 --> 02:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
programming
 
02:17:26.349 --> 02:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just had a
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
question about the prison environment
 
02:17:31.849 --> 02:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if you could go into a
 
02:17:34.490 --> 02:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
little bit about what the environment of
 
02:17:37.009 --> 02:17:37.019 align:start position:0%
these three prisons are and is it calm
 
02:17:39.530 --> 02:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
is it dangerous and violent what is the
 
02:17:41.389 --> 02:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
environment in the prison's like
 
02:17:43.250 --> 02:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler that is a complex
 
02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:44.230 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler that is a complex
question

02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
I would say that the environment is
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
dependent on which unit you're housed on
 
02:17:51.950 --> 02:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
and here's why we've purposely created
 
02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
some modified therapeutic communities
 
02:17:55.849 --> 02:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
and taken over whole housing units and
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
said if you want to voluntarily go live
 
02:18:00.530 --> 02:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
on this Wellness unit because you're all
 
02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
74 of you are invested in your own
 
02:18:05.209 --> 02:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
Wellness the quality of culture on that
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
unit is different they're already
 
02:18:08.929 --> 02:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
self-motivated and when you go on that
 
02:18:10.129 --> 02:18:10.139 align:start position:0%
unit which I hope you have an
 
02:18:11.570 --> 02:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so they'll actually
 
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
they say to me commissioner it's a
 
02:18:13.969 --> 02:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
little weird in here I don't I don't
 
02:18:15.049 --> 02:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
want to scare you but I don't feel like
 
02:18:17.450 --> 02:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
I'm in prison and I said I'm glad you
 
02:18:19.849 --> 02:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
don't because I I need us all to
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
remember you have a second chance on
 
02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
life and we need you to think about your
 
02:18:24.650 --> 02:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
future and then we have other programs
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
called the focus unit it is not an
 
02:18:29.209 --> 02:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
acronym not an acronym it's capital F it
 
02:18:31.129 --> 02:18:31.139 align:start position:0%
is a modified Therapeutic Community that
 
02:18:33.770 --> 02:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
targets substance use disorder climate
 
02:18:35.929 --> 02:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
on that's a little differently yes
 
02:18:37.610 --> 02:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
they're motivated to be there but we've
 
02:18:39.410 --> 02:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
actually in some instances held back
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
disciplinary infractions and said we
 
02:18:43.490 --> 02:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
want to highly motivate you to go there
 
02:18:45.049 --> 02:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
so you have some people who raise their
 
02:18:46.429 --> 02:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
hand and some people who avoid
 
02:18:48.349 --> 02:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
disciplinary infractions to go there so
 
02:18:49.849 --> 02:18:49.859 align:start position:0%
it's still therapeutic but a different
 
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
environment and we also have the realism
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we literally have security threat
 
02:18:56.330 --> 02:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
groups in our institutions also known as
 
02:18:58.849 --> 02:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
gangs who we are trying to thwart their
 
02:19:00.650 --> 02:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
criminal conduct within our Correctional
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
environment so to your question is it
 
02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
dangerous yes it can be incredibly
 
02:19:06.410 --> 02:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
dangerous is every day incredibly
 
02:19:08.089 --> 02:19:08.099 align:start position:0%
dangerous it has the potential to be
 
02:19:10.370 --> 02:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
dangerous and one of the highest
 
02:19:13.629 --> 02:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
diverted pieces of Contraband right now
 
02:19:13.639 --> 02:19:15.190 align:start position:0%
diverted pieces of Contraband right now
is

02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:19:19.490 --> 02:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
fentanyl laced paper and paper that has
 
02:19:21.650 --> 02:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
been soaked in synthetic cannabinoids
 
02:19:24.410 --> 02:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
and we also found paper soaked in
 
02:19:26.810 --> 02:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
cocaine and so our staff at Corrections
 
02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
in our mail room have personal
 
02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
protective equipment not just because of
 
02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
covid-19 but because we're asking them
 
02:19:36.349 --> 02:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
the touch paper we went to photocopying
 
02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
I will call Casual mail and now we have
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
to figure out what to do with legal mail
 
02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
because Contraband legal mail is the
 
02:19:45.049 --> 02:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
other venue which we're experiencing so
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
I give you a flavor of that because it
 
02:19:48.049 --> 02:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
depends on where you are in the
 
02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
organization in the institutions
 
02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
um I have a quick question about what
 
02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
you just said do you work with a Postal
 
02:19:56.450 --> 02:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
Inspector to follow up on these crimes
 
02:19:57.770 --> 02:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
oh we do
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like it's like a flashback
 
02:20:03.050 --> 02:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
to the 60s acid soaking paper and is
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
that what's going on there when we when
 
02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
we change practice to divert something
 
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
somebody always finds some other way to
 
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
do it yeah there's always a new mouse
 
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
trap isn't there okay
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you I just have a quick question
 
02:20:17.929 --> 02:20:17.939 align:start position:0%
about the northern correctional facility
 
02:20:20.330 --> 02:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
and the and the Gen the regional Men's
 
02:20:22.250 --> 02:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
prison do you have the same
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility and are they similar in
 
02:20:32.750 --> 02:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
for men as well and the policies
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
implemented by the Department of
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
Corrections are consistent across all
 
02:20:41.450 --> 02:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
Sites with one minor exception we may do
 
02:20:43.389 --> 02:20:43.399 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
02:20:46.610 --> 02:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
gender-centric for women and or men that
 
02:20:49.130 --> 02:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
would be the only deviation and the
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
northern correctional facility for men
 
02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
does not have a robust special housing
 
02:20:54.830 --> 02:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
unit that is our most restrictive
 
02:20:57.770 --> 02:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
housing unit it has a few cells that we
 
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
would use as a transitional location
 
02:21:01.969 --> 02:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
before we would send somebody down to
 
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
the Men's prison if they engaged in
 
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
conduct that would result in that
 
02:21:10.250 --> 02:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah and just as far as your
 
02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
staff you go I know he talked about the
 
02:21:14.330 --> 02:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
is there a retirement system is it the
 
02:21:18.410 --> 02:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
state retirement system
 
02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
um how does that work
 
02:21:22.849 --> 02:21:22.859 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question so the
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
changes in retirement some people will
 
02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:25.910 align:start position:0%
changes in retirement some people will
say

02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
switch from 20 years to 25 years we lost
 
02:21:29.690 --> 02:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
some people I think we saw that
 
02:21:32.210 --> 02:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
statistically the new group of
 
02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
individuals coming in we'll say to you
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
I have to work 80 hours a week at base
 
02:21:41.150 --> 02:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
pay to get to equalized pay of my other
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
law enforcement partner who's doing and
 
02:21:46.010 --> 02:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
has meets the same minimum certification
 
02:21:48.290 --> 02:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
requirements and why is that the case so
 
02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
we have to get equalized pay for
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
equalized certification but we literally
 
02:21:54.410 --> 02:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
literally need more people to come and
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
be interested in being Corrections
 
02:21:57.530 --> 02:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
Officers and it's a defined benefit
 
02:22:00.410 --> 02:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
pension is that correct to find benefit
 
02:22:02.929 --> 02:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
to get a they get a payment based upon
 
02:22:04.490 --> 02:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
the years of service yeah just the same
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
retirement system laws that are on the
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
books today depending on your date of
 
02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:09.349 align:start position:0%
books today depending on your date of
hire

02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
hire
 
02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
I think that's people have to understand
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
I myself have a pension and the pension
 
02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
is is uh
 
02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
a very big driver when people get to the
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
point where they get into retirement
 
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
because it's really really a big thing
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
it is and the changes uh from last
 
02:22:26.330 --> 02:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
legislative cycle if I recall correctly
 
02:22:27.889 --> 02:22:27.899 align:start position:0%
that adjusted how that calculation
 
02:22:30.469 --> 02:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
happened was to the benefit of the staff
 
02:22:31.849 --> 02:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
that work in the Department of
 
02:22:33.550 --> 02:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
Corrections those were positive changes
 
02:22:36.349 --> 02:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
I will tell you when and I'm not trying
 
02:22:38.210 --> 02:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
to tell you what to do certainly but
 
02:22:40.610 --> 02:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
never do that when the retirement laws
 
02:22:44.690 --> 02:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
are opened in in bills it scares all of
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
my staff so I have to work on what they
 
02:22:49.969 --> 02:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
say what is the legislature trying to do
 
02:22:51.170 --> 02:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
and I said we're going to have to wait
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
and find out
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
and and we do too
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
02:23:03.950 --> 02:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner for coming today
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know I reckon back to my years in
 
02:23:09.170 --> 02:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
college when I studied criminal justice
 
02:23:11.570 --> 02:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
with with a few of your correct your pro
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
probation and parole officers that were
 
02:23:15.410 --> 02:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
my instructors
 
02:23:17.929 --> 02:23:17.939 align:start position:0%
um I remember early uh during the
 
02:23:20.809 --> 02:23:20.819 align:start position:0%
pandemic there was
 
02:23:22.969 --> 02:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
um National Guardsmen that were called
 
02:23:25.610 --> 02:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
to assist your department uh if you
 
02:23:27.650 --> 02:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
could just comment on the services they
 
02:23:29.809 --> 02:23:29.819 align:start position:0%
provided if they're still there
 
02:23:31.490 --> 02:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
um and if you have a current need for
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
them as well thank you for that question
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh covid-19 are the toughest two uh
 
02:23:39.889 --> 02:23:39.899 align:start position:0%
years of my career for the reasons that
 
02:23:42.830 --> 02:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
makes sense and covid-19 not only
 
02:23:44.929 --> 02:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
affected everyone's life and and people
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
got to work from home my staff did not
 
02:23:49.550 --> 02:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
get to work from home uh they had to
 
02:23:51.230 --> 02:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
continue to come to work but with that
 
02:23:54.170 --> 02:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
said Copa 19 affected their families so
 
02:23:56.090 --> 02:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
did we have people that themselves as
 
02:23:57.650 --> 02:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
employees were affected by covid-19
 
02:23:59.809 --> 02:23:59.819 align:start position:0%
infection yes but then their families
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
were affected by the illness so when we
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
started to look at the numbers of people
 
02:24:06.349 --> 02:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
who were literally out of the office
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
either for their own illness or
 
02:24:10.190 --> 02:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
supporting their families it did trigger
 
02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
my ass to the governor to bring in
 
02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
members of the National Guard to
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
supplement our security forces
 
02:24:19.969 --> 02:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
we use them differently in New Hampshire
 
02:24:21.469 --> 02:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
than they were used in other states
 
02:24:23.690 --> 02:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
other states put National Guard service
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
members all over the place in different
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
posts we made a purposeful decision
 
02:24:29.929 --> 02:24:29.939 align:start position:0%
through collaboration with the Attorney
 
02:24:31.969 --> 02:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
General's office myself the National
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
Guard and the governor's office to put
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
them in posts that did not put them in
 
02:24:37.730 --> 02:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
the direct supervision of people
 
02:24:39.950 --> 02:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
incarcerated because that is a unique
 
02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
expertise and then also working with
 
02:24:43.969 --> 02:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
director skippa over at police stands
 
02:24:45.530 --> 02:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
and training Council to put them through
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
a course of curricula that would help
 
02:24:50.570 --> 02:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
Orient and Orient them to those roles so
 
02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
to your answer we put them in non-direct
 
02:24:55.250 --> 02:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
positions within the organization
 
02:24:58.490 --> 02:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
perimeter security control rooms things
 
02:25:00.349 --> 02:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
of that nature and we would not have
 
02:25:02.210 --> 02:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
made it through those times without the
 
02:25:04.370 --> 02:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
National Guard support so we've used
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
them twice and we don't have any
 
02:25:08.570 --> 02:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
National Guard service members in the
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
organization right now but I am
 
02:25:12.110 --> 02:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
constantly monitoring what is going on
 
02:25:14.510 --> 02:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
and if I have to make that ask and those
 
02:25:16.250 --> 02:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
individuals that were assigned to us
 
02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
came from the National Guard card with
 
02:25:21.309 --> 02:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
military policing experience and we're
 
02:25:23.630 --> 02:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
picked specifically for their career
 
02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:29.630 align:start position:0%
picked specifically for their career
backgrounds

02:25:29.630 --> 02:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:32.450 --> 02:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up to that were you able
 
02:25:34.130 --> 02:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
to recruit any of those National Guards
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
members for your staff
 
02:25:38.090 --> 02:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
I know that the military police are
 
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
actually on the Texas border so yeah um
 
02:25:42.670 --> 02:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
I tried
 
02:25:47.150 --> 02:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
I tried and we are a veterans friendly
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
veterans friendly employer so we are
 
02:25:51.469 --> 02:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
connected in that way
 
02:25:54.170 --> 02:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
but I'll try to recruit anybody I have
 
02:25:55.150 --> 02:25:55.160 align:start position:0%
no shame
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner um that's going
 
02:25:58.849 --> 02:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
to have to be it we're way behind tell
 
02:26:09.610 --> 02:26:09.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:12.170 --> 02:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
I I would just again thank you for that
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
that was literally just a snapshot from
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
September to November if I gave you the
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
whole list of the places we've been for
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
the last probably two years it would it
 
02:26:22.969 --> 02:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
would cover the whole the whole slide
 
02:26:25.610 --> 02:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
deck we have been down to those areas
 
02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
um pursuant to that question and I know
 
02:26:29.690 --> 02:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
we're all out of time if there are
 
02:26:31.309 --> 02:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities that you think we might
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
not be aware of please let us know we'll
 
02:26:36.290 --> 02:26:36.300 align:start position:0%

02:30:52.130 --> 02:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
um how you determine that or make that
 
02:31:05.950 --> 02:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:09.290 --> 02:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
and uh you know an officer will be
 
02:31:10.610 --> 02:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
signs have been carrying that that
 
02:31:16.510 --> 02:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
interaction that he has with the driver
 
02:31:20.090 --> 02:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
if you know the typical uh over the
 
02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
years you know the uh
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
impaired drivers into the alcohol use
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
um you know there will be different
 
02:31:31.309 --> 02:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
things that the doctors are looking for
 
02:31:33.290 --> 02:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
um that they can testify to that they've
 
02:31:37.010 --> 02:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
observed and observations that are made
 
02:31:39.349 --> 02:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
um drugs you know different drugs
 
02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of the same uh impairment
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
that shows now that there may be some
 
02:31:47.290 --> 02:31:47.300 align:start position:0%
more specific things
 
02:31:50.330 --> 02:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
experts throughout the state uh state
 
02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:53.180 align:start position:0%
employees as well as local departments
 
02:31:56.210 --> 02:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
he asked to come in and do an evaluation
 
02:31:59.270 --> 02:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
with the whole program uh for the GRE
 
02:32:01.730 --> 02:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
program uh training that they received
 
02:32:01.740 --> 02:32:03.469 align:start position:0%
program uh training that they received
and

02:32:03.469 --> 02:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:03.479 --> 02:32:11.330 align:start position:0%
and
approach

02:32:11.330 --> 02:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
is that does that answer your question
 
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat follow-up okay so if you think
 
02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
someone is impaired
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
okay on a stop
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
do you call someone out to that location
 
02:32:28.250 --> 02:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
or that's a situation where you're gonna
 
02:32:38.870 --> 02:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:40.670 --> 02:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
we will arrest
 
02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:47.750 align:start position:0%
we will arrest
evidence

02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
now there are Opportunities For The
 
02:32:52.849 --> 02:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
Individual to continue their cooperation
 
02:32:55.610 --> 02:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
through you know breath tests
 
02:32:57.170 --> 02:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
um the evaluation for the drug
 
02:32:57.180 --> 02:32:58.330 align:start position:0%
um the evaluation for the drug
recognition

02:32:58.330 --> 02:32:58.340 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
02:33:02.450 --> 02:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
things uh things to that effect just as
 
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
the officer is testing building their
 
02:33:09.590 --> 02:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
case some sometimes these interactions
 
02:33:12.429 --> 02:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
are a result of a quarter vehicle act
 
02:33:15.230 --> 02:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
there may be the increase involved and
 
02:33:20.090 --> 02:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:28.929 --> 02:33:28.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:30.830 --> 02:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
um just one quick question it's a
 
02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up on on what what she was
 
02:33:36.410 --> 02:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
speaking about my so what you're saying
 
02:33:38.450 --> 02:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
is um I'm wondering if I missed
 
02:33:39.770 --> 02:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
something in this so of course there
 
02:33:41.450 --> 02:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
would be the um
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
um I forget what she said it was but the
 
02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:44.870 align:start position:0%
um I forget what she said it was but the
um

02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:47.150 --> 02:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
an officer who is trained to identify
 
02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
right but somewhere in between the uh
 
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
the initial encounter in that assessment
 
02:33:55.610 --> 02:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
that's you know on the street assessment
 
02:33:58.490 --> 02:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
and going to court for something
 
02:33:59.870 --> 02:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
um are you saying that the evidence
 
02:34:02.450 --> 02:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
presented would be the person's
 
02:34:04.670 --> 02:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
assessment the expert's assessment or I
 
02:34:05.929 --> 02:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
mean wouldn't there be a test in the
 
02:34:07.849 --> 02:34:07.859 align:start position:0%
meantime to
 
02:34:11.210 --> 02:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
yeah so we were talking about the
 
02:34:16.150 --> 02:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:20.090 --> 02:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
they are you know applying the laws that
 
02:34:21.889 --> 02:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
they should have been born before that
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
interaction there's opportunities for
 
02:34:27.530 --> 02:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
like I said breath test uh you know
 
02:34:31.010 --> 02:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
potentially uh what does
 
02:34:34.010 --> 02:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
um and potentially a recognition of
 
02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:37.140 align:start position:0%
effort that I've given there
 
02:34:38.750 --> 02:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
they're out making their observations
 
02:34:40.849 --> 02:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
and giving the tests that they give and
 
02:34:43.250 --> 02:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
then all that information together and
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
about to
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
later that if there goes to that level
 
02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:47.990 align:start position:0%
later that if there goes to that level
okay

02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:34:49.550 --> 02:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
yeah it does I just I didn't hear
 
02:34:50.809 --> 02:34:50.819 align:start position:0%
anything about the test I'm going that
 
02:34:52.490 --> 02:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
seems like it would be important thank
 
02:34:55.070 --> 02:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
you and I'm I'm really pleased to see
 
02:34:57.170 --> 02:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
the members um engaging and asking all
 
02:34:58.910 --> 02:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
these questions I'm going to try and
 
02:35:01.130 --> 02:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
arrange for um the opportunity for
 
02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
ride-alongs with everyone
 
02:35:05.150 --> 02:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
um with either State Police or local
 
02:35:06.650 --> 02:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
police is still in the planning stages
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
so you'll be able to see what it looks
 
02:35:10.849 --> 02:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
like firsthand and I hope you all Avail
 
02:35:14.030 --> 02:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
yourselves of that once we get it set up
 
02:35:16.190 --> 02:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
um one more question go ahead
 
02:35:18.950 --> 02:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative Reed so um when somebody
 
02:35:20.750 --> 02:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
stopped for DUI you have the
 
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
breathalyzer test there's no test yet
 
02:35:27.530 --> 02:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
for other substance other substances
 
02:35:29.349 --> 02:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
like marijuana you don't have a
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
breathalyzer or on the spot test for
 
02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:40.130 --> 02:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time and
 
02:35:44.290 --> 02:35:44.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:47.650 --> 02:35:47.660 align:start position:0%
and last but most definitely not least
 
02:35:50.750 --> 02:35:50.760 align:start position:0%

02:35:53.210 --> 02:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
Anna of the New Hampshire Public
 
02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:56.870 align:start position:0%
Anna of the New Hampshire Public
Defenders

02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:03.230 --> 03:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:07.969 --> 03:08:07.979 align:start position:0%
thank you uh the you said that the in
 
03:08:09.710 --> 03:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
the upcoming budget you had requested a
 
03:08:10.610 --> 03:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
certain amount
 
03:08:13.550 --> 03:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
what will that set your hourly rate at
 
03:08:16.969 --> 03:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:16.979 --> 03:08:34.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:08:34.370 --> 03:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:38.210 --> 03:08:38.220 align:start position:0%
um you can see we we can't escape even
 
03:08:41.630 --> 03:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
begin to match those things but those
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
are the rates just about fast and I want
 
03:08:49.490 --> 03:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
going from 60 to 90 dollars he is
 
03:08:55.790 --> 03:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
competitive it just may not be conducted
 
03:08:58.730 --> 03:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
In This Moment In This housing market in
 
03:09:01.070 --> 03:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
the labor market and then this public
 
03:09:03.769 --> 03:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
service marketing but it is the race and
 
03:09:05.809 --> 03:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
they've finally moved
 
03:09:09.170 --> 03:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:11.170 --> 03:09:11.180 align:start position:0%
um we have a contract returning program
 
03:09:14.090 --> 03:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
it's basic adjustments they're not quite
 
03:09:21.170 --> 03:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:23.090 --> 03:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just curious to see if the
 
03:09:24.469 --> 03:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
what you submitted for the for your
 
03:09:26.389 --> 03:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
budget request if if it would get you
 
03:09:28.190 --> 03:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
where you would like to be or at least
 
03:09:36.070 --> 03:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:41.510 --> 03:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:43.370 --> 03:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
and no one was going to raise space and
 
03:09:45.889 --> 03:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:48.730 --> 03:09:48.740 align:start position:0%
and it was a discussion about that okay
 
03:09:52.570 --> 03:09:52.580 align:start position:0%
yeah thinking about what that is
 
03:09:58.990 --> 03:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:00.769 align:start position:0%
 
somebody

03:10:00.769 --> 03:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
03:10:00.779 --> 03:10:01.969 align:start position:0%
somebody

as a point of information uh High School
 
03:10:49.490 --> 03:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh Salem High School is paying its Latin
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%

representative

03:11:08.030 --> 03:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative

representative
response

03:11:09.889 --> 03:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
response
 
03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's a question
 
03:11:14.210 --> 03:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
I recall from my four years
 
03:11:15.469 --> 03:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
on the committee that's on the other
 
03:11:17.090 --> 03:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
side of that on that other room over
 
03:11:17.100 --> 03:11:18.309 align:start position:0%
side of that on that other room over
there

03:11:18.309 --> 03:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
that what we're talking about here is a
 
03:11:25.130 --> 03:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
an individual's constitutional right to
 
03:11:25.140 --> 03:11:27.130 align:start position:0%
an individual's constitutional right to
representation

03:11:27.130 --> 03:11:27.140 align:start position:0%
representation
 
03:11:29.990 --> 03:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
and to put a cost on that is pretty
 
03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:31.250 align:start position:0%
and to put a cost on that is pretty
difficult

03:11:31.250 --> 03:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
03:11:36.050 --> 03:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
but I my recollection is there is
 
03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
if the person is able to to afford it a
 
03:11:42.469 --> 03:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to pay for those
 
03:11:46.190 --> 03:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
services and that is actually collected
 
03:11:48.650 --> 03:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
by probation and parole is that correct
 
03:11:48.660 --> 03:11:50.030 align:start position:0%
by probation and parole is that correct
yeah

03:11:50.030 --> 03:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:11:50.040 --> 03:12:00.349 align:start position:0%
yeah
probation

03:12:00.349 --> 03:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:06.710 --> 03:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:06.720 --> 03:12:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:35.389 --> 03:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
right and and it never ever will
 
03:12:38.450 --> 03:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
actually meet what you have spent in
 
03:12:39.830 --> 03:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
their defense
 
03:12:39.840 --> 03:12:47.150 align:start position:0%
their defense
now

03:12:47.150 --> 03:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:47.160 --> 03:12:56.929 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:12:56.929 --> 03:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:59.469 --> 03:12:59.479 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
03:13:01.730 --> 03:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative sailing
 
03:13:03.230 --> 03:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
03:13:04.849 --> 03:13:04.859 align:start position:0%
um you spoke a bit about some of the
 
03:13:07.010 --> 03:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
challenges for public defenders I'm
 
03:13:08.269 --> 03:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's funding for and
 
03:13:10.429 --> 03:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
support for mental health services to
 
03:13:11.809 --> 03:13:11.819 align:start position:0%
ensure their ability to continue doing
 
03:14:00.230 --> 03:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:01.969 --> 03:14:01.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:14:03.950 --> 03:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
um I first of all thank you I I
 
03:14:05.929 --> 03:14:05.939 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you do so much I wanted
 
03:14:07.910 --> 03:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
03:14:11.450 --> 03:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh I have had experiences with uh trying
 
03:14:13.490 --> 03:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
to assist people with who who have a
 
03:14:16.070 --> 03:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
public defender in other states and um
 
03:14:18.110 --> 03:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
03:14:20.570 --> 03:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
not a good experience
 
03:14:22.730 --> 03:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
um you keep talking about uh the idea of
 
03:14:23.690 --> 03:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
you want to have the quality of
 
03:14:25.849 --> 03:14:25.859 align:start position:0%
representation I appreciate that so much
 
03:14:27.530 --> 03:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
and I believe that you do and I'm
 
03:14:30.170 --> 03:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
curious uh what you might think I guess
 
03:14:31.490 --> 03:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
this is more of a subjective question
 
03:14:33.050 --> 03:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
but what do you think is kind of the
 
03:14:34.849 --> 03:14:34.859 align:start position:0%
difference and and why that happens is
 
03:14:37.730 --> 03:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
it uh you know how is it that you are
 
03:14:39.889 --> 03:14:39.899 align:start position:0%
able to provide this quality of care
 
03:14:41.330 --> 03:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
service and you know I know the
 
03:14:42.769 --> 03:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
priorities and things like that I think
 
03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
that that's that's wonderful I'm just
 
03:16:18.590 --> 03:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
03:16:23.990 --> 03:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'm just trying do you have
 
03:16:25.429 --> 03:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
any comments on what I'm trying to
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
figure out is is who can apply for this
 
03:16:31.010 --> 03:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
um what kind of financial stuff do they
 
03:16:34.010 --> 03:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
take into consideration and once you've
 
03:16:35.570 --> 03:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
made the decision that someone is either
 
03:16:37.910 --> 03:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
qualified or not qualified is the
 
03:16:40.070 --> 03:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
qualified individual then on their own
 
03:16:42.230 --> 03:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
and they just go find out find
 
03:16:43.849 --> 03:16:43.859 align:start position:0%
representation in the private Community
 
03:18:16.670 --> 03:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:16.680 --> 03:18:22.670 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:18:22.670 --> 03:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:22.680 --> 03:18:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:18:25.670 --> 03:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:35.830 --> 03:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much it has been very
 
03:18:41.090 --> 03:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
enlightening and I'm thank you for um
 
03:18:43.730 --> 03:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
responding to my invitation and um if
 
03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
you have any information you'd like to
 
03:18:46.610 --> 03:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
hand out or pass on or anything
 
03:18:47.929 --> 03:18:47.939 align:start position:0%
throughout the year if you're feeling
 
03:18:55.429 --> 03:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:58.010 --> 03:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:18:58.020 --> 03:19:06.230 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
oh

03:19:06.230 --> 03:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:08.990 --> 03:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to briefly address the
 
03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee because I didn't have a chance
 
03:19:12.110 --> 03:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
to before we started
 
03:19:14.809 --> 03:19:14.819 align:start position:0%
um as we noticed today it was very
 
03:19:16.910 --> 03:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
informal and we all got to ask our
 
03:19:18.889 --> 03:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
questions and that's the way I like to
 
03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
conduct hearings if we can all
 
03:19:23.389 --> 03:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
do that civilly I could plan on
 
03:19:24.830 --> 03:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
continuing that way for the rest of the
 
03:19:24.840 --> 03:19:25.630 align:start position:0%
continuing that way for the rest of the
year

03:19:25.630 --> 03:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:19:27.950 --> 03:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
just everyone if you have a follow-up
 
03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
question make sure you say follow up
 
03:19:31.969 --> 03:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
please I noticed someone I'm not going
 
03:19:33.469 --> 03:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
to mention anyone stuck like seven
 
03:19:38.030 --> 03:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
questions and one of their questions but
 
03:19:39.769 --> 03:19:39.779 align:start position:0%
I would like to be able to continue the
 
03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
way we did it this was really good it
 
03:19:43.670 --> 03:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
was really informative so let's um if we
 
03:19:45.290 --> 03:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
can all if we can all play nice together
 
03:19:46.969 --> 03:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
that's the way we're going to continue
 
03:19:48.650 --> 03:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
and if any of you have any questions for
 
03:19:50.750 --> 03:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
me I'm happy to take them there will be
 
03:19:52.730 --> 03:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
a schedule coming out shortly
 
03:19:54.769 --> 03:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
um we will be having three meetings next
 
03:19:57.769 --> 03:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
week on Wednesday Thursday and Friday we
 
03:19:59.389 --> 03:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
have a lot of bills it's looking like
 
03:20:00.410 --> 03:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to be somewhere around
 
03:20:02.929 --> 03:20:02.939 align:start position:0%
between 85 and 90.
 
03:20:04.730 --> 03:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want to be here in June I
 
03:20:06.050 --> 03:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
don't know about you so we're going to
 
03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
crank through these as best we can and
 
03:20:10.330 --> 03:20:10.340 align:start position:0%
we'll get our work done
 
03:20:13.849 --> 03:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
representative Bolden you had a question
 
03:20:15.950 --> 03:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
actually a request
 
03:20:19.010 --> 03:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
um between the seven questions and a
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
question and then not saying follow-up I
 
03:20:23.570 --> 03:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
was wondering if maybe just off the top
 
03:20:25.130 --> 03:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
of your head if you could because we
 
03:20:26.570 --> 03:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
have so many new people on the committee
 
03:20:28.730 --> 03:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
who are first timers I mean if you could
 
03:20:31.969 --> 03:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
run through your expectations for how to
 
03:20:33.710 --> 03:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
conduct yourself in Committee in general
 
03:20:36.950 --> 03:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
I think it might be helpful sure
 
03:20:39.349 --> 03:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
um I I would expect everyone to just
 
03:20:41.090 --> 03:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
make sure you if you want to ask a
 
03:20:42.650 --> 03:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
question raise your hand wait wait till
 
03:20:45.469 --> 03:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
you're recognized if you have a
 
03:20:46.550 --> 03:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up just go ahead and put your
 
03:20:49.130 --> 03:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
hand up I will universally almost 100 of
 
03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
the time allow the follow-up question
 
03:20:54.650 --> 03:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
um when we have witnesses testifying I
 
03:20:57.290 --> 03:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
expect the questions to be pertinent and
 
03:20:58.610 --> 03:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
Germaine something that you really want
 
03:21:00.290 --> 03:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
to know the answer to that you will help
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
think will help the rest of the
 
03:21:04.910 --> 03:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
committee make a decision I don't want
 
03:21:07.070 --> 03:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
to see gotcha questions
 
03:21:08.690 --> 03:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
um there's generally a rule regarding
 
03:21:11.690 --> 03:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
electronic items during hearings I'm not
 
03:21:13.790 --> 03:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
going to be really ridiculous about that
 
03:21:16.730 --> 03:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
either but if I see people Googling
 
03:21:19.010 --> 03:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
stuff on a laptop or a phone to give
 
03:21:20.690 --> 03:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
gotcha questions to the witness then I'm
 
03:21:22.370 --> 03:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
going to have to enforce that if you
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
need it just to look at text to see if
 
03:21:25.490 --> 03:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
someone's texting you or kid are you
 
03:21:28.010 --> 03:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
going to take a phone call I'm going to
 
03:21:29.630 --> 03:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
be flexible about that as long as we can
 
03:21:29.640 --> 03:21:30.349 align:start position:0%
be flexible about that as long as we can
all

03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:21:33.469 --> 03:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
get our business done then that's good
 
03:21:33.479 --> 03:21:34.190 align:start position:0%
get our business done then that's good
um

03:21:34.190 --> 03:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:36.889 --> 03:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
let me see what else
 
03:21:39.110 --> 03:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
what about the wood
 
03:21:41.210 --> 03:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah
 
03:21:45.170 --> 03:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
um what would we call the Wichita leaves
 
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's don't ask questions that
 
03:21:49.910 --> 03:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
you already know the answer to just so
 
03:21:52.070 --> 03:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
that the rest of us can hear what you
 
03:21:53.630 --> 03:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
already know that would be would you
 
03:21:54.889 --> 03:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
believe that I already know this answer
 
03:21:56.269 --> 03:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
to this question but I'm going to ask it
 
03:21:58.690 --> 03:21:58.700 align:start position:0%
anyway please don't do those
 
03:22:01.429 --> 03:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
let me see what else uh representative
 
03:22:03.710 --> 03:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
Newman go ahead yeah I just have a
 
03:22:04.969 --> 03:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
question about I mean I've been thinking
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
about electronic equipment and using how
 
03:22:09.429 --> 03:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
you use it or abuse it
 
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
but you can use your phone to uh to get
 
03:22:15.650 --> 03:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
the text of of uh bills that come up
 
03:22:17.570 --> 03:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
that you don't have a paper copy for and
 
03:22:19.849 --> 03:22:19.859 align:start position:0%
oh sure yeah stuff like that but it's
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
much easier to observe on a computer so
 
03:22:23.570 --> 03:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know if computers are ramboten
 
03:22:25.969 --> 03:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
or what because that's computers are a
 
03:22:27.230 --> 03:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
bit much if we're all sitting behind
 
03:22:28.910 --> 03:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
laptops it's just kind of disrespectful
 
03:22:30.110 --> 03:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
to the witness
 
03:22:32.090 --> 03:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
um it just doesn't it's not a good look
 
03:22:34.370 --> 03:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
for all of us if you have a tablet
 
03:22:37.070 --> 03:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
tablet put that in your lap but having a
 
03:22:38.809 --> 03:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
computer screen yeah I mean I just think
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's much easier to do that and if a
 
03:22:44.030 --> 03:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
tablet is is being used yeah in any
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
conspicuous manner yes to get
 
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
information because you might go back
 
03:22:49.610 --> 03:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
and be looking at something that you've
 
03:22:51.170 --> 03:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
written up for this already or whatever
 
03:22:53.690 --> 03:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
sure it's important that we treat each
 
03:22:55.849 --> 03:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
other with respect and I I'd like to
 
03:22:57.349 --> 03:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
forget about parties when we're in here
 
03:22:59.269 --> 03:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
I really really would um this is about
 
03:23:01.429 --> 03:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
criminal justice
 
03:23:03.469 --> 03:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to try my best to do
 
03:23:04.670 --> 03:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
that and if we all do that together
 
03:23:06.650 --> 03:23:06.660 align:start position:0%
it'll be really cool
 
03:23:09.710 --> 03:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
um but above respect for each other I
 
03:23:11.030 --> 03:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we show respect
 
03:23:13.610 --> 03:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
for the witnesses regardless if they say
 
03:23:15.050 --> 03:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
the most ridiculous thing you've ever
 
03:23:15.060 --> 03:23:15.889 align:start position:0%
the most ridiculous thing you've ever
heard

03:23:15.889 --> 03:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
heard
 
03:23:17.870 --> 03:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
you smile and you let them say their
 
03:23:19.550 --> 03:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
piece they came here to talk to you they
 
03:23:21.469 --> 03:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
some of them traveled a long long way to
 
03:23:22.389 --> 03:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
get here
 
03:23:25.250 --> 03:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
and we have the respect to listen to
 
03:23:27.950 --> 03:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
them and that's fine and move to the
 
03:23:29.450 --> 03:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
next subject
 
03:23:32.090 --> 03:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
um and and that's how above all that's
 
03:23:33.590 --> 03:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's going to make
 
03:23:36.349 --> 03:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
me use this ridiculous Hammer is um
 
03:23:39.610 --> 03:23:39.620 align:start position:0%
talking to disrespectfully to a witness
 
03:23:41.929 --> 03:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to ask about your first
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
two words you said you want to forget
 
03:23:45.710 --> 03:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
about yeah before you started I did not
 
03:23:47.630 --> 03:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
hear what you said party affiliation
 
03:23:50.030 --> 03:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
party we're a team in here we're our own
 
03:23:51.650 --> 03:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
party I think I got party but I didn't
 
03:23:53.269 --> 03:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
know what you I didn't know whether you
 
03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
were talking about just the best party
 
03:23:57.170 --> 03:23:57.180 align:start position:0%
or yeah well that's at the end of the
 
03:23:59.330 --> 03:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
year but while we're in here I'd like to
 
03:24:01.729 --> 03:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
be the criminal justice party so if and
 
03:24:04.070 --> 03:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
I know that's not reasonable to every
 
03:24:06.229 --> 03:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
extent but the best we can
 
03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
um representative Bolden
 
03:24:10.849 --> 03:24:10.859 align:start position:0%
um while we were here today we got two
 
03:24:13.130 --> 03:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
notices for upcoming
 
03:24:16.910 --> 03:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
oh okay so 18th and 19th and so I was
 
03:24:19.190 --> 03:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have a sense of
 
03:24:22.010 --> 03:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
um how frequently each week will be
 
03:24:24.290 --> 03:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
meeting and what days
 
03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
um generally it's going to be
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be Wednesday Thursday
 
03:24:29.570 --> 03:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
or Friday
 
03:24:31.969 --> 03:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
um right now I want it we have as you
 
03:24:34.010 --> 03:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
know we have those first bills that have
 
03:24:35.389 --> 03:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
the financial implications we have to
 
03:24:38.269 --> 03:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
take care of first so we may have
 
03:24:40.309 --> 03:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
um three days a week just to get those
 
03:24:42.769 --> 03:24:42.779 align:start position:0%
out of the way I'd like to be able to go
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
back to two
 
03:24:46.849 --> 03:24:46.859 align:start position:0%
um yeah three days a week so Wednesday
 
03:24:49.550 --> 03:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
Thursday Friday weekly for the for at
 
03:24:51.650 --> 03:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
least a few weeks yeah yeah and then and
 
03:24:53.269 --> 03:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
then I'd like to go back if I can to
 
03:24:55.790 --> 03:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
just Wednesday Thursdays nobody wants to
 
03:24:57.530 --> 03:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
be here on Friday but we got to do we're
 
03:24:58.490 --> 03:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
going to do because we share this room
 
03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
with ways and means
 
03:25:03.650 --> 03:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
and is it I'm sorry follow-up no go
 
03:25:05.929 --> 03:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
ahead um is it your expectation that on
 
03:25:08.690 --> 03:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
the vacation weeks that we'll still be
 
03:25:10.849 --> 03:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
having hearings I don't want to if we
 
03:25:11.990 --> 03:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
can that's why you're going to see a
 
03:25:14.630 --> 03:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
heavy schedule coming up um I don't want
 
03:25:16.010 --> 03:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
to because I know people want to spend
 
03:25:17.510 --> 03:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
time with their kids and their grandkids
 
03:25:19.550 --> 03:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
and I I don't want to be here either but
 
03:25:21.290 --> 03:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
we have to do what we have to do so if
 
03:25:23.090 --> 03:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
we put in the time now maybe we can
 
03:25:25.729 --> 03:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
avoid the vacation weeks
 
03:25:29.809 --> 03:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
last one Amanda last one anything else I
 
03:25:33.229 --> 03:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
wonder about I'll just just email myself
 
03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
um so on weeks when there's session and
 
03:25:37.550 --> 03:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's like on a Thursday and it's one day
 
03:25:39.110 --> 03:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
are we meeting do you think the
 
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
Wednesday before or just not at all in
 
03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
those weeks no I would think the
 
03:25:43.790 --> 03:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
Wednesday before I don't think we have
 
03:25:45.950 --> 03:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
the luxury of taking off a whole week um
 
03:25:48.530 --> 03:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
if we want the vacation weeks off so
 
03:25:48.540 --> 03:25:49.910 align:start position:0%
if we want the vacation weeks off so
yep

03:25:49.910 --> 03:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:25:52.670 --> 03:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
um oh representative Murray
 
03:25:56.330 --> 03:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:59.090 --> 03:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
sure the one thing I will ask
 
03:26:01.429 --> 03:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
um I I really would appreciate if no
 
03:26:03.290 --> 03:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
one's live tweeting our meetings you
 
03:26:06.410 --> 03:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
know you can tweet later you can bash
 
03:26:08.929 --> 03:26:08.939 align:start position:0%
Republicans all you want a bash Democrat
 
03:26:11.210 --> 03:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
don't bash our committee and don't bash
 
03:26:12.469 --> 03:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
each other especially when we're trying
 
03:26:14.750 --> 03:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
to work together so live tweeting I wish
 
03:26:16.010 --> 03:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't
 
03:26:18.290 --> 03:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
um but checking emails whatever you got
 
03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:22.560 --> 03:26:29.349 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:26:29.349 --> 03:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:32.570 --> 03:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
just today was super informal it will be
 
03:26:33.950 --> 03:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit more informal when we're
 
03:26:35.630 --> 03:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
having a public hearing
 
03:26:37.309 --> 03:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
um a little more formal when we're
 
03:26:39.469 --> 03:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
having actual public hearings
 
03:26:41.809 --> 03:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
um but as I said I'm going to try to
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
keep it as relaxed as possible because
 
03:26:46.370 --> 03:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
and also one other thing I want to
 
03:26:48.650 --> 03:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
mention I'm going to try and arrange as
 
03:26:50.630 --> 03:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
many field trips as possible and as many
 
03:26:52.490 --> 03:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
guest speakers as possible I think
 
03:26:53.870 --> 03:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
informed legislators are better
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
legislators and a lot of times hearing
 
03:26:57.650 --> 03:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
about something reading about something
 
03:26:59.750 --> 03:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
or even seeing something in old episodes
 
03:27:02.450 --> 03:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
of Law and Order are not quite as good
 
03:27:04.190 --> 03:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
as going to court and sitting there and
 
03:27:05.570 --> 03:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
watching defendants be brought up and
 
03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
put in the dock and and have an attorney
 
03:27:09.590 --> 03:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
represent them and what's going what's
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
all involved in that or ride along or
 
03:27:13.729 --> 03:27:13.739 align:start position:0%
visit to the to the prison they'll be
 
03:27:16.190 --> 03:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
strictly obviously voluntary I'm not
 
03:27:18.889 --> 03:27:18.899 align:start position:0%
going to insist anyone go but I will try
 
03:27:20.330 --> 03:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
and make the opportunity there for you
 
03:27:20.340 --> 03:27:21.469 align:start position:0%
and make the opportunity there for you
all

03:27:21.469 --> 03:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:27:24.050 --> 03:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:34.370 --> 03:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
are we uh if you have to use the
 
03:27:36.530 --> 03:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
restroom by all means um please do um
 
03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
just try to be if there's a witness
 
03:27:39.889 --> 03:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
testifying just try to keep yourself as
 
03:27:41.929 --> 03:27:41.939 align:start position:0%
inconspicuous as possible so as not to
 
03:27:44.090 --> 03:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
distract from them uh representative uh
 
03:27:44.100 --> 03:27:45.590 align:start position:0%
distract from them uh representative uh
salic

03:27:45.590 --> 03:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
salic
 
03:27:47.210 --> 03:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to support your idea
 
03:27:49.490 --> 03:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
about going for a ride-along um I did
 
03:27:50.929 --> 03:27:50.939 align:start position:0%
that last year with their two years ago
 
03:27:52.250 --> 03:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
with the Laconia police department and
 
03:27:54.349 --> 03:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
went with two separate officers and I
 
03:27:55.910 --> 03:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
would encourage people if you schedule a
 
03:27:58.550 --> 03:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
ride along with the Department to
 
03:27:59.929 --> 03:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
um first of all not necessarily do it in
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
your town because it's really
 
03:28:02.269 --> 03:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
embarrassing when you pull over your
 
03:28:02.279 --> 03:28:03.290 align:start position:0%
embarrassing when you pull over your
friends

03:28:03.290 --> 03:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
friends
 
03:28:04.610 --> 03:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:28:07.550 --> 03:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
um but also to seek out the opportunity
 
03:28:10.070 --> 03:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
to go with more than one person
 
03:28:11.809 --> 03:28:11.819 align:start position:0%
um the two officers that happened to
 
03:28:13.790 --> 03:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
take me had very very dramatically
 
03:28:16.010 --> 03:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
different views of fleecing where one
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
viewed as an opportunity for connections
 
03:28:20.809 --> 03:28:20.819 align:start position:0%
and the other was eager to find as many
 
03:28:22.250 --> 03:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
people as he could decide during the
 
03:28:24.469 --> 03:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
time we were together I will be trying
 
03:28:26.510 --> 03:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
to arrange it through the state police
 
03:28:29.150 --> 03:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
and potentially Concord or Manchester I
 
03:28:30.349 --> 03:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
don't think um
 
03:28:32.389 --> 03:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
coming out to the you call it community
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
of Deerfield where I live is going to
 
03:28:35.809 --> 03:28:35.819 align:start position:0%
really give you an idea or flavor of
 
03:28:37.130 --> 03:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
what's going on in police in New
 
03:28:39.830 --> 03:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um I'll I'll try and make
 
03:28:41.809 --> 03:28:41.819 align:start position:0%
that available to everyone and and as
 
03:28:43.250 --> 03:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
the weeks go by we'll figure that out
 
03:28:44.510 --> 03:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
but thank you I appreciate that
 
03:28:46.370 --> 03:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative Newman I just have a
 
03:28:48.110 --> 03:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion maybe you could have more
 
03:28:50.570 --> 03:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
microphones at the uh that's definitely
 
03:28:52.190 --> 03:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
yeah and then
 
03:28:54.469 --> 03:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're on when when the
 
03:28:56.210 --> 03:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
testimony is given because I haven't got
 
03:28:57.969 --> 03:28:57.979 align:start position:0%
my hearing aids yet but I need them okay
 
03:29:00.349 --> 03:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
and those thingies over there are
 
03:29:01.969 --> 03:29:01.979 align:start position:0%
actually kind of annoying I gotta figure
 
03:29:04.610 --> 03:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
out that I can't see the witnesses I
 
03:29:06.170 --> 03:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
think they're speakers I don't know why
 
03:29:07.790 --> 03:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
they have to be like up at face level
 
03:29:10.610 --> 03:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay um that's it if you have any more
 
03:29:10.620 --> 03:29:11.389 align:start position:0%
okay um that's it if you have any more
