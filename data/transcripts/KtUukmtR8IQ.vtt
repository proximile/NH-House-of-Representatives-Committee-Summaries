that representative Ford
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes I was in higher
 
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
ed for a very long time I was a
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
professor assist uh Dean vice president
 
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
and president I was also president of
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
the faculty Union
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
both Nea and aft I'm rather unusual in
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
that regard not many people get to go
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
into Administration who've been in
 
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
presidents of unions but as it turned
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
out it was a good experience all the way
 
00:18:59.810 --> 00:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
around I have a different if you may
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
perspective than some of my colleagues
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's useful in this
 
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
committee because this is a committee
 
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
that has to deal with all aspects of
 
00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:12.539 align:start position:0%
education and it helps if you can bring
 
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
those perspectives to the table not just
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
one but many of them
 
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
um and I've appreciated the opportunity
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
to be here this is only my second term
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
which is probably why I got this job and
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh they they promised that I don't have
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
to take off my socks the numbers don't
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
get that big so we're all right but
 
00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:35.870 align:start position:0%
get that big so we're all right but
nonetheless

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
um it's an interesting committee and
 
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980 align:start position:0%

Caitlin said of school facilities so
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is a big place
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
um but really school facilities almost
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
everything except for Career and
 
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
Technical Education Centers when you
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
think of those facilities they are under
 
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
a separate program but almost everything
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
else happens under my Bureau
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and part of that today
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
um is talking about the building aid
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
program which falls under my Bureau I
 
00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:50.339 align:start position:0%
have a handout in front of you
 
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
um titled building Aid our cute little
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
logo on the top with a leaf uh and
 
00:37:59.690 --> 00:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
um it says Bureau of school facilities
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
on there so if you want to locate that
 
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
that's the packet that I'm going to be
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
going through I also have two other
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
packets that are just fyis unfortunately
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
I didn't have enough handouts for the
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
center folks but
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
um that I'll just really have there for
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
information so today for the most part
 
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
we're just going through this building
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
Aid packet and then of course anything
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
else you want to discuss it's your
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
meeting so I'm happy to adjust uh for
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
you all
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
uh there are uh five pieces to my packet
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
um when I reference page numbers they
 
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
all come from different sources so
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
there's page numbers on the bottom you
 
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
can ignore those page numbers for this
 
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
purpose and if we're talking about page
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
numbers I'll reference them in the top
 
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
right corner of the page
 
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
um that is all the page numbers for this
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
whole packet
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
there are 11 of them I'm mostly just
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
going to talk about page two so uh if
 
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
you want to start there uh this is our
 
00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
program I am challenged with trying to
 
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
put my program on one page and here it
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
is so this is the if I have to say one
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
page of building Aid this is the page
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
you might want to study and everything
 
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
else is really this supporting
 
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.310 align:start position:0%
else is really this supporting
information

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
my contact information is up there uh
 
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
we're gonna for some of you you've heard
 
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
of building Aid and you know you're just
 
00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
dreaming of your shopping list that's
 
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.450 align:start position:0%
dreaming of your shopping list that's
fine

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.109 align:start position:0%
fine
um

00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
um others it's brand new and I'll talk
 
00:39:29.329 --> 00:39:29.339 align:start position:0%
to you and your might not understand any
 
00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
of it and that's fine uh it's a it's a
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
big program feel free to contact me at
 
00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
any time if you have any questions uh we
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
can this is I love to talk about
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
building AIDS so call me anytime
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
um the most important thing to you
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
probably all is where does this fall in
 
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:47.660 align:start position:0%
the law the legislation is under RSA
 
00:39:50.569 --> 00:39:50.579 align:start position:0%
198.15 and supported by Department of
 
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:53.660 align:start position:0%
Education roles in Ed 321
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
and the basics are what is building Aid
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
building Aid is really just State
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
dollars for school construction projects
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
Public School construction projects the
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
thing about building Aid that's all it
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
is State funds to help schools uh us
 
00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:11.579 align:start position:0%
help school districts
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
um with their school construction
 
00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.470 align:start position:0%
um with their school construction
projects

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
the that portion of
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
um the state portion in law is between
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
30 and 60 percent so the grant that the
 
00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:26.579 align:start position:0%
state gives out if somebody were to
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
receive one the state portion ranges
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
from 30 to 60 percent with the local
 
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
communities picking up the remainder
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
um as you can imagine the the rate is
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
dictated by law and that is
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
um more you know more affluent
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
communities getting the 30 percent and
 
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
less affluent communities up near the 60
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
percent one thing I'd like to point out
 
00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
about that rate it is not a linear rate
 
00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
the average rate is 38 so
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
um when you're thinking about what the
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
average Community gets it's 38 if you're
 
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
a 40 community and you're like how come
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
we're 40 well you're above average
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
that's I guess I'll just leave it at
 
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.710 align:start position:0%
that's I guess I'll just leave it at
that

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.490 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.130 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
um let's see so that's the building Aid
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
rate that's the abortion the rest is
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
covered by the local communities and the
 
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
source of those funds is the education
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
the funding structure now here's where
 
00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
we get into some fun the funding
 
00:41:27.849 --> 00:41:27.859 align:start position:0%
structure from
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
1946 this program started and ran for 63
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
years all the way through 2012.
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and on this might shock you but
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're all already sitting the schools
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
would submit an application we would
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
tell the legislature how much money we
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
need you guys might specifically want to
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
close your ears on this part but then it
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
was funded so essentially the schools
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
set told us their need they filled out
 
00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
an application we reported to the
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
legislature in the legislature funded
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
that amount that was requested so
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
all eligible projects were funded up
 
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
through 2012.
 
00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.990 align:start position:0%
through 2012.
well

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
um actually that's not true but we'll
 
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
get to that that was what the funding
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
structure was at the time all the way
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
through 2012.
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
um in 2013 that structure in law changed
 
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
in 2013 the state said we can't continue
 
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
to fund all of the projects
 
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
um we're going to change the law and
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to only fund some of them
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and what happened is that they put
 
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
there was a moratorium well let's talk
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
about that in a minute sorry
 
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
um that there was a cap on building Aid
 
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
that was put in the law of no more than
 
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars a year would be spent
 
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
at most on building AIDs that was put
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
into law so now when you don't fund all
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
the projects you now have to make it a
 
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
competitive project so now the law also
 
00:42:59.690 --> 00:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
include included criteria for schools to
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
be competitive over that Grant amount
 
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
those things could be
 
00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.750 align:start position:0%
those things could be
um

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
life safety issues overcrowding Ada
 
00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.690 align:start position:0%
life safety issues overcrowding Ada
issues

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
um in appropriate spaces for teaching
 
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
whatever curriculum they needed like you
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
know if you had a high school space that
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
didn't have the high school science
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
space that you needed
 
00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:23.579 align:start position:0%
um those are all points that would allow
 
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
you to creep up
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
um as showing that you needed building
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
Aid more than another application
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
what also significantly changed is the
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
way that
 
00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:41.540 align:start position:0%
um projects were paid so from 46 to 2012
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
projects were paid over the life of the
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
bond and this is important to know how
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
projects were paid in the past because
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
it affects right now projects were paid
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
over the life of the bond so and I'll
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
get into an example in a minute but then
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
in 2013 projects were paid differently
 
00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
if you got an award 80 percent of that
 
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
award was given up front which is much
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
different than getting it over the term
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
of the bond so you'd get eighty percent
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
of your award up front you'd finish your
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
project and you'd get the remaining 20
 
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.609 align:start position:0%
project and you'd get the remaining 20
percent

00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
so let's just take an example let's do
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
some math right there's some other
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
people you're it's right engineering so
 
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do a quick math example uh
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
and that example is on your paper
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
um for if you want to follow along so
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
the old fundings well let's just say a
 
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
school district takes out a 20-year Bond
 
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
for a 40 million dollar project so
 
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
they're building a new school for 40
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
million I realize I have to update my
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
numbers probably but let's just say they
 
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
got a good deal now 40 million dollar
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
School 20-year bond to build a new
 
00:44:47.339 --> 00:44:48.410 align:start position:0%
School 20-year bond to build a new
school

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:50.579 align:start position:0%
let's say their state portion between
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
that 30 and 60 percent let's say they
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
got they were a 50 community and they
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
got 50 Aid so of their 40 million dollar
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
project they're gonna get a 20 million
 
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
dollar state aid and then the local
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
community is going to have to come up
 
00:45:07.849 --> 00:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
with the other 20 million dollars the
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
old funding structure would have paid
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
over their life of the bond that 20-year
 
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
Bond so the school would have received
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
on average one million dollars a year
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
for 20 years to pay that 20 million
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
dollar state aid
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
in 2013 when the law changed that now
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
meant that that 40 million dollar
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
project that was receiving 20 million
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
in-state Aid is still going to receive
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
20 million in state aid but they're
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
going to receive 80 up front
 
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
16 million dollars they're going to
 
00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:47.420 align:start position:0%
complete the project in a couple years
 
00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
and then they're going to get the
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
remaining four million dollars of that
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
project so you can see the communities
 
00:45:56.829 --> 00:45:56.839 align:start position:0%
are receiving that 20 million dollars
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
within a couple of years time they start
 
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
time and finish rather than spread out
 
00:46:04.609 --> 00:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
over the 20 years
 
00:46:04.619 --> 00:46:05.349 align:start position:0%
over the 20 years
um

00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's important when we talk about
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
um what we call the tail so we'll talk
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
about that in a minute
 
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.050 align:start position:0%
about that in a minute
um

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
from there
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
um that's what the law says so let's
 
00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
look at the history is in the bottom
 
00:46:20.819 --> 00:46:22.190 align:start position:0%
look at the history is in the bottom
here

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
um in the top greenish
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
um that's the 63 years between 1946 and
 
00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:33.980 align:start position:0%
2009 that 63 period uh 63 period
 
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
projects were funded and met demand okay
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
however in 2010
 
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
there was a moratorium put in place and
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
between 2010 and 2019
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
the state said we're going to put a halt
 
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:53.339 align:start position:0%
on building Aid a two-year moratorium
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
every two years it just kept being
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
reinstated for 10 years the state did
 
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
not build any projects so in 2010 if you
 
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
can kind of figure out the timeline and
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
you know we're paying for all of these
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
projects in 2010 somebody says we don't
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
have enough money if you cut if you
 
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:11.339 align:start position:0%
think about what 2010 was like that kind
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
of probably makes sense in 2010 people
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
said we're going into a moratorium and
 
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
kind of reigning in on this spending on
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
school construction and then while in a
 
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
moratorium into 2013 that's when that
 
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
law changed and that moratorium
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
continued with the exception of 2018
 
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
there's one exception in there and you
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
can see I'm now in the gray area that
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
10-year moratorium there was was one
 
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.589 align:start position:0%
10-year moratorium there was was one
application

00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
um emergency project that was funded in
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
2018 the legislature lifted that
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
moratorium funded that one project and
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
then closed the moratorium or went back
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
to the moratorium in 2019 that project
 
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
um for those of you interested was
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale Elementary School they needed a
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
3.6 million dollar renovation to correct
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
some significant structural issues uh
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
and they are a 60 Community they got 2.2
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Aid
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
um that project was funded
 
00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.890 align:start position:0%
um that project was funded
um

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:11.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
in in the next three lines in that table
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
are the bienniums so in the moratorium
 
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:24.980 align:start position:0%
was lifted in 2020 for the first time
 
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
and five you have to apply for building
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
I8 ahead of time so five school
 
00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
districts applied for building eight
 
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:35.339 align:start position:0%
even though we were in a moratorium five
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
school districts said hey we kind of
 
00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
think we might come out of the
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
moratorium let's just prepare just in
 
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.329 align:start position:0%
moratorium let's just prepare just in
case

00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:41.339 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
um in those five projects uh total cost
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
for those five projects was 45 million
 
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
dollars they were rent one of them was a
 
00:48:50.569 --> 00:48:50.579 align:start position:0%
renovation one was like a three million
 
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
dollar Edition they weren't filled
 
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
builds but those were the what the
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
projects we received their requests from
 
00:48:59.290 --> 00:48:59.300 align:start position:0%
the state was 17 million that biennium
 
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
three of those projects were funded by
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
the state uh and uh for a total of 8.6
 
00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.329 --> 00:49:11.339 align:start position:0%
I am going to go back I apologize but I
 
00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:14.339 align:start position:0%
want to explain what that last column is
 
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
um so if you recall
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
um the old funding was you get money a
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
little bit of money for 20 years right
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
if or whatever your bond was I had a
 
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
couple of schools take out a 30-year
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
Bond so they would get whatever that
 
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
130th roughly of their state aid we call
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
that the tail uh well one of the next
 
00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
Pages talks a little bit more about this
 
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
but when you hear the state us talk
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
about the tail we're talking about this
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
extra money we keep paying on these old
 
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
projects the funding mechanism is
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
different now So eventually that last
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
project that we are paying for will
 
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
eventually be paid off their bond will
 
00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
be done in 2041 so in 2041 we won't have
 
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
a tail anymore but until we have a tail
 
00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
we have to still talk about the tail and
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
so in that column at the very last
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
column where it says 53 million dollars
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
per year that's the tail so we are
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
continuing even during the moratorium
 
00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
the state paid that obligation to pass
 
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
construction projects that 53 million is
 
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
the tail it's it it fluctuates it's
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's the average between 29 2010 and
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
2019 it was you know sometimes it was 60
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
million sometimes it was 45 but um the
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
average there is 53
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
um throughout those years
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
and then that and then that 2.2 million
 
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
dollars is the new project so this last
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
column represents the tail those
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
obligated payments fast projects plus
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
any new projects we funded that biennium
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
or that year
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
so now back in the blue now that I've
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
kind of explained that you can see that
 
00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.790 align:start position:0%
kind of explained that you can see that
last

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
um fiscal 2021 row that last column says
 
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars per year plus 8.6
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
million that just represents that the
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
state appropriated on average 40 million
 
00:51:11.329 --> 00:51:11.339 align:start position:0%
dollars per year and then they also
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
funded those three projects for an
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
additional 8.6 million for that biennium
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
in 2022 23 schools got
 
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
um wind that that building Aid that
 
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
moratorium is finally lifted so
 
00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
applications were due July dates are so
 
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
important right applications were due
 
00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
that biennium July 1st of 2020.
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
schools had a lot of things on their
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
plate in July of 2020 you don't put an
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
application in overnight schools work
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
very very hard on these applications
 
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
they are very detailed you work with an
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
architect you've got planned preliminary
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
plans drawn up you have mechanical
 
00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
engineering facility studies so it's not
 
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
something you do overnight schools had
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
to really put some time and dedication
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
into applying for building Aid during
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
the pandemic so early on during the
 
00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:12.140 align:start position:0%
pandemic too so we did receive
 
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
12 applications
 
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
uh the Department of Education ranks
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
those applications based on what the
 
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
state law says we funded we got enough
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
money 30 million dollars was
 
00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:27.059 align:start position:0%
appropriated for new projects and so we
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
were able to pick off the top project
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
and fund them we had some more money
 
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
left so of that 30 million we picked the
 
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
second project off and was able to fund
 
00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
those two projects uh with the 30
 
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars that the state granted
 
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
us so of 12 projects that put
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
applications in they were requesting 140
 
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars and we've received from
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
the state 30 million so it allowed the
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
state for us to fund two of those
 
00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.430 align:start position:0%
state for us to fund two of those
projects

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
now we had another application process
 
00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:00.059 align:start position:0%
that opened up
 
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
um last uh I guess I'll say last year in
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
2022 uh July of 2022 17 school districts
 
00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
applied their projects totaled 564
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars their request from the
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
state is 227 million dollars of course
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
we don't know what our budget is going
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
to be so we don't know how many
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
applications we'll be able to fund
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
um so that last column just says 26
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars for our tail payments
 
00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:31.140 align:start position:0%
those obligated uh payments to pass
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
projects plus whatever the state
 
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
appropriates for new construction
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
projects so
 
00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of information on here and
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
um if you need to go back to anything
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
um those are the numbers but I'm also a
 
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
visual graphics person so if you want to
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
go to page three
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh let's not go to page well that's
 
00:53:59.210 --> 00:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
short we'll go we'll go to three page
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
three not much of a graphic but page
 
00:54:01.559 --> 00:54:02.510 align:start position:0%
three not much of a graphic but page
three

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
um if you're wondering what your rate is
 
00:54:06.049 --> 00:54:06.059 align:start position:0%
in your community here's a list of those
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
rates uh if you were a Cooperative
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
School District that weight is just
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
rated weighted by the number of students
 
00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:16.460 align:start position:0%
you have from each of these communities
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
but there are the rates right there
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
um it's also continues on page four
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
and those rates are recalculated every
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
um every year those applications are
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
open we do that in the fall
 
00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
um the year school districts are
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
applying and it is uh function those
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
rates are a function of two criteria
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
median family income
 
00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
and equalize valuation per pupil and
 
00:54:52.849 --> 00:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
what's important to remember I think
 
00:54:56.329 --> 00:54:56.339 align:start position:0%
about the rate is it is a rank in the
 
00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
state so some people say oh median
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
family income isn't really accurate
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
um that may or may not be true but is it
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
accurate in the sense of ranking
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
um do you does each Community kind of
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
still rank in that same order so the
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
formula puts everybody in a rank from
 
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
median family income equalized valuation
 
00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:20.099 align:start position:0%
per pupil and their ranks are averaged
 
00:55:23.329 --> 00:55:23.339 align:start position:0%
so that's how that formula is derived in
 
00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:25.460 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
and then page five
 
00:55:30.849 --> 00:55:30.859 align:start position:0%
um this um
 
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
this is a graphic of the tale so I'm on
 
00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
this page here
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
um this is what people say is the tail
 
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
it I guess that I didn't name it but I
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
can see it I guess I can see the tail
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
and you can see it hey it's getting
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
smaller and smaller and smaller and
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's because we don't fun projects
 
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
this way anymore that every year we pay
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
off a few every year I've got somebody
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
that's finishing up a 20-year Bond and
 
00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:02.900 align:start position:0%
those projects are falling off the list
 
00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
we went into a moratorium in 2009 but we
 
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
didn't start making a payment on a
 
00:56:12.609 --> 00:56:12.619 align:start position:0%
couple one of those projects until 2011
 
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
they had a 30-year Bond so that's why
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
this goes out to 2041 if anybody kind of
 
00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:21.059 align:start position:0%
wanted to be like why did we change the
 
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
law and we're still paying projects in
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
2041. 30 your bonds exist school
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
districts coupled school districts to
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
pull them out but for the most part you
 
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
can see a big jump in 2030
 
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
um it tails off so
 
00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
um that's the dark the dark color is
 
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
officially the tail
 
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
obligated uh payments to past projects
 
00:56:44.329 --> 00:56:44.339 align:start position:0%
and historically the legislature has
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
always funded those projects even during
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
the moratorium
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
the lighter blue
 
00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
um bar or the bar on top of the darker
 
00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
blue one is in 2010 remember that's when
 
00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
we went into a moratorium so budget was
 
00:57:05.089 --> 00:57:05.099 align:start position:0%
really really tight the state
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
um right or wrong the state took out a
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
bond themselves to pay the obligated
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
payments to school districts so the
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
states Bond I always get a couple
 
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
Chuckles from you on that about that
 
00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:22.250 align:start position:0%
Chuckles from you on that about that
decision

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
um for a Visa card just just so that you
 
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
know in law that practice is now
 
00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:29.089 align:start position:0%
know in law that practice is now
prohibited

00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
um in law clearly states the state
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
cannot do that but the state did decide
 
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
to do that in 2010 so we are having to
 
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
make bond payments
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
um every year
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
um it was a
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
20-year Bond so you can see in 2030 that
 
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
payment is done we make our last payment
 
00:57:50.329 --> 00:57:50.339 align:start position:0%
in 2030 on that state bond that was used
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
to make those obligated payments in
 
00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:55.609 align:start position:0%
to make those obligated payments in
2010.

00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
2010.
 
00:57:58.970 --> 00:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
now the dotted lines at the top that go
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
like this I personally think it's
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
important to notice that they're jumping
 
00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
up and down a little are the new
 
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
projects so in 2020 in 2021 that
 
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
biennium that was the 8.6 million
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
dollars that's on the chart 6.7 in the
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
first year of the biennium 1.9 in the
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
second year biennium those are for new
 
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.829 align:start position:0%
second year biennium those are for new
projects

00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:26.579 align:start position:0%
um in 2022 and 2023 of course we're in
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
2023 uh now
 
00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.849 align:start position:0%
2023 uh now
um

00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
those um for the first year the biennium
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
um 30 million dollars was appropriated
 
00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
for new projects and zero million for
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
year two of the biennium
 
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
now if you remember the in 2013 the law
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
capped building Aid at 50 million
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
dollars per year which is why this chart
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
only goes up to 50 million so that chart
 
00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
goes up to 50 million because the law
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
says you can't fund any more than 50
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
million however in 2022 you see all of
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
that well they did fund more than 50
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
million I've got my past payments to
 
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
past projects I got my bond payment plus
 
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars for new projects what
 
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
the state did just for last year is they
 
00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:23.420 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 they lifted that
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
cap just for that one year to allow that
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars and then none was
 
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
appropriated in 2023 so you can kind of
 
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
see it's
 
00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
um it basically took some money in year
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
two and put it in year one is um sort of
 
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
what that what that was
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
now we're in 2020 well we'll be talking
 
00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
about 2024 and 2025 you'll have lots of
 
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
bills about building Aid
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and that dotted line is a TBD so
 
00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.270 align:start position:0%
um and that dotted line is a TBD so
um

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
in the table you'll just see the numbers
 
00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
that derive that so just walking you
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
through the table real quick the fiscal
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
year is there if you want to know what
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
the actual tale is for each year
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
um for 2024 that tail payment obligated
 
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
payments to unpass projects is 20.6
 
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
million my bond our bond payment to on
 
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
that 2010 bond is a 6.8 million that
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
total I've been calling it Debt Service
 
01:00:28.089 --> 01:00:28.099 align:start position:0%
but that total debt is Our obligation is
 
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
27.4 million
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
the next column it says 50 million less
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
Debt Service the reason why I calculate
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
this number is because schools often ask
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
if building Aid is fully funded that
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
means they're want to know how much is
 
01:00:46.849 --> 01:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
available if that 50 million dollars is
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
appropriated that would be 22.6 million
 
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
dollars in 2024. if 50 million is
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated the Department of Education
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
will have 22.6 million dollars to spend
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
on new projects
 
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
um in 2025 you could read those numbers
 
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
across but to me the take home message
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
to schools is that I would have 26.1
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
million dollars to Grant out for new
 
01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
construction projects those two numbers
 
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
we are are we rank projects in a
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
biennium list
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
um so what we really want to know is how
 
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
much money we'll have in the biennium to
 
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
fund new projects so the last column is
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
just 48.6 million dollars so for so when
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
schools say if building Aid is fully
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
funded next biennium how much money are
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
going to be available for new projects I
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
say 48.6 million dollars if the
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
legislature fully funds building Aid to
 
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
what the law says right now
 
01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.049 align:start position:0%
what the law says right now
um

01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:48.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:50.700 align:start position:0%
so a lot on that graph too
 
01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
um so now I'm going to keep going and
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
then you can
 
01:01:56.809 --> 01:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
tons of questions because these next few
 
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
pages are very quick you Page Six
 
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
seven and eight are the 17 projects that
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
applied for building aid for the next
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
biennium fiscal 24 and 25 these schools
 
01:02:15.609 --> 01:02:15.619 align:start position:0%
are ready for a construction project
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
well there's a little asterisk by that
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
um they haven't necessarily received
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
voter approval they were prepared to
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
submit an application to see if they
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
could get state aid to then see if they
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
would be moving forward with voter
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
approval some schools seek voter
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
approval ahead of time a little easier
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
in the cities to do that than the others
 
01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
without knowing how much grant money is
 
01:02:38.099 --> 01:02:39.589 align:start position:0%
without knowing how much grant money is
available

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
um but this is the list of 17 schools
 
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
that applied they are in order of rank
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
so we received the department the
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Education receive those
 
01:02:52.329 --> 01:02:52.339 align:start position:0%
applications last summer we spent time
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
ranking those applications we present
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
them a preliminary list to the school
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
building authority in
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
December then the school building
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
authority verifies our ranking checks to
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
see if the Department of Education
 
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
um asks us questions about our ranking
 
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:11.339 align:start position:0%
see if the Department of Education
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
followed the process then submits that
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
over to the State Board of Education
 
01:03:17.329 --> 01:03:17.339 align:start position:0%
with State Board of Education also
 
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
verifies that information and publishes
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
this list this is the approved list by
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education it was
 
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
approved in December uh November 10th
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
for the in order of rank for
 
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
construction projects
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
so what this means is if we get any
 
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
funds for new projects we're going to go
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
to rank one project and we're going to
 
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
offer them
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
all of the money that they need to
 
01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:48.059 align:start position:0%
complete their project we do not prorate
 
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
this this isn't like everybody gets a
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
little bit it's
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
um number one school there is Rochester
 
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
they're they're proposing to close those
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
two schools consolidate and bring a new
 
01:04:02.329 --> 01:04:02.339 align:start position:0%
Elementary School to Rochester
 
01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
um try not to talk about all projects
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
specifically but they're current
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
buildings are from the late 1800s and so
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
um uh they sit very nicely at the top of
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
this list they are proposing
 
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
um to build a 33 million dollar School
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
Rochester is a 60 community so their
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
State Building Aid request is 20 million
 
01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
dollars 20.1 so if 21 point million
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
dollars Elise is granted to the state
 
01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
for a new state for new projects they'll
 
01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
be the ones to get get that money first
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
we just keep running down the list until
 
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
we run out of money
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
um some people are probably already
 
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
asking if building Aid were fully funded
 
01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
we would get 48.7 million dollars how
 
01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
many projects are would be funded and
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
the answer is three the top three
 
01:04:57.650 --> 01:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
projects almost would be funded um the
 
01:04:59.690 --> 01:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
last one would be shorted I think a tiny
 
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
bit but for the most part all three of
 
01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:03.059 align:start position:0%
those top three projects will be funded
 
01:05:03.059 --> 01:05:05.210 align:start position:0%
those top three projects will be funded
however

01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
um these these projects still need to go
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
to their voters for approval so this is
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
still the local local they still have to
 
01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
go to that local process and say hey
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
we're going to receive this money if so
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
are we ready to build this project if
 
01:05:20.569 --> 01:05:20.579 align:start position:0%
they say no then we just work down the
 
01:05:20.579 --> 01:05:21.530 align:start position:0%
they say no then we just work down the
list

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
um you know if I don't want to use
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
anybody for an example I hate to use
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
them if School X fails their vote then
 
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
we're just going to go to the next
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
school on that list and work out until
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have any money left
 
01:05:38.569 --> 01:05:38.579 align:start position:0%
um that's so that's some for you all and
 
01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:43.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
ten and eleven those are the obligated
 
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
payments on past projects so all of
 
01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
these school projects were built prior
 
01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.230 align:start position:0%
these school projects were built prior
to

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
um 2000 that was built during the war or
 
01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
prior to the moratorium applied prior to
 
01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
the moratorium
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
and those projects are still receiving
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
State Building Aid
 
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
um because they were were paying on the
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
life of their bond so you'll see some
 
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
projects in there you'll see their
 
01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:14.900 align:start position:0%
payment years
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
to take the top project Amherst had a
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
renovation project to Mount Vernon
 
01:06:21.599 --> 01:06:22.450 align:start position:0%
renovation project to Mount Vernon
School

01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:22.460 align:start position:0%
School
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
their school
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
um their amount eligible for cost was
 
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
5.6 that million that we paid 30 percent
 
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
on so their Total Building Aid was 1.7
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
million and we're paying 2010 to 2029
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
they're receiving 53 593
 
01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:45.299 align:start position:0%
000 from us uh no that's how much they
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
have left I'm sorry their payments for
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 and fiscal 25 are listed there
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
and then the remaining payments
 
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
um if you're curious how much
 
01:06:57.049 --> 01:06:57.059 align:start position:0%
um those remaining payments are there's
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
a total column on the bottom in fiscal
 
01:06:59.339 --> 01:07:01.010 align:start position:0%
a total column on the bottom in fiscal
24.

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
24.
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
um that is that that's that tail 20.5
 
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
million and then 17.2 million which
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see on that graph as well
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
I did decently trying to fly through
 
01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:17.029 align:start position:0%
I did decently trying to fly through
that

01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm more than happy to thank you very
 
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
much Amy I do have one question in
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
looking at that list for 24 uh Rochester
 
01:07:29.089 --> 01:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
Colebrook Monadnock
 
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
um and that then we're out of money if
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
we allocate or appropriate what we're
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to appropriate
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
um Colebrook has closed the academy and
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
the tuition their CTE students across
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
the river to Vermont Canaan
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
is there any how do you deal with the
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
issue that you may have a high school
 
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
that there's also they're requesting
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
School building aid but they also may
 
01:07:57.289 --> 01:07:57.299 align:start position:0%
have CTE that they're moving into that
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
building is that going to come out of
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
another fund of money like the the
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
Career Tech you know I just I know where
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
it comes from but I'm it's a question we
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
may have asked from folks here yeah
 
01:08:11.089 --> 01:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question so the
 
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
building Aid law allows building Aid to
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
be applied to CTE spaces so those
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
projects that project a lot of that is
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
CTE space for that building Aid project
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
what they can't do is they can't receive
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
um you could get CTE funding that would
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
have paid for 75 of your if you got a
 
01:08:35.809 --> 01:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
CTE fund fun funded project it would
 
01:08:38.209 --> 01:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
have paid 75 percent and then that
 
01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
remaining 25 we would have paid building
 
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
Aid on so that though that practice that
 
01:08:46.249 --> 01:08:46.259 align:start position:0%
law was changed in 2013 I think maybe
 
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
even earlier
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
but the law still allows any approved
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
program space to be paid for with
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
building Aid so those CTE spaces are
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
eligible for building Aid thank you are
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
representative Myler
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the question on the
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
the rank order list that you have here
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
is this does that get ranked every year
 
01:09:16.849 --> 01:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
or like for example if you pay for the
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
first three does that mean that conquer
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
then comes up to the number one the
 
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
coming year or how does houses what's
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
the status of this list on an annual
 
01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.410 align:start position:0%
the status of this list on an annual
basis

01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
um very good question so we this list is
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
a biennium list
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
um it's for fiscal 24 and 25.
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
um you know I always tell schools we'll
 
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
we if we're lucky we'll get two buckets
 
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
of money for new projects
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
um you know whatever that those payments
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
are let's just say first it's 25 million
 
01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:49.259 align:start position:0%
in year one and 25 million in year two
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
we'll offer that to the top rank project
 
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll offer it in rank order until
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
we run out of money
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
um then year two we finished paying off
 
01:09:59.150 --> 01:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
whoever we couldn't fully pay and then
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
we continue to that on the list so then
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
it's closed out the school tools that
 
01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
don't receive funding would move up and
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
stay on the list in the next biennium
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
only if they're approved at the local at
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
their District's legislative body so it
 
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
would be difficult for it's I don't know
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
what I don't know what these districts
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
will do and I don't but
 
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
I I think it's difficult if you are down
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
on the list to go to your voters and say
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
hey we're not going to get any money but
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
would you approve our project so that we
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
can stay on the list
 
01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:37.970 align:start position:0%
can stay on the list
um

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
it may happen
 
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
um but maybe for the top schools they
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
might they're only going to stay on the
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
list next biennium if their District
 
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
legislative body has approved the
 
01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.330 align:start position:0%
legislative body has approved the
project

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
we do have legislation coming before us
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to take us right through
 
01:10:54.169 --> 01:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
the whole process policy process for for
 
01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
this issue uh looking at the timeline
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
look for application through the time
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
that the award is awarded also we're
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
looking at the issue of do they
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
automatically stay on that list if
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
there's another communities coming in
 
01:11:11.169 --> 01:11:11.179 align:start position:0%
with a higher priority in terms of need
 
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh surpass that these are all issues and
 
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
questions which we have to have some
 
01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
resolution on and there is a bill there
 
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
are three of them coming to us that
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to resolve here
 
01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:30.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh if I look I'm on page five of your
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
um if I read this right we have about
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
41.3 million dollars worth of tail left
 
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
from a 2010 bond that we took out the
 
01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
light blue portion of that photoed all
 
01:11:57.610 --> 01:11:57.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
that sounds that sounds right yeah and
 
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
then as I look at the darker blue that
 
01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
looks like it could be about 111 plus
 
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars and then those
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
those obligations are done from those
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
long-term and going forward if I
 
01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
understand information right we will
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
never see a tail again because we find
 
01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:22.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
correct by by funding these kind of
 
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
obligations is there is there penalty
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
for funding in advance
 
01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
um I do I say at least if most of these
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
schools I think are working with the
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
municipal Bond Bank and you can't pay
 
01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
those off early from what I've heard
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
from the municipal Bond Bank
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
um that they can't have a you know a
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
20-year Bond and in year 15 just finish
 
01:12:47.689 --> 01:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
paying it that they're they're stuck
 
01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:49.580 align:start position:0%
with that Bond
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
see you might be noted that back in 2009
 
01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
2010 there are those in the room right
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
now that remember Our obligation was 540
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:13:04.729 --> 01:13:04.739 align:start position:0%
we've been whittling that down
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
represent Weiler did you have a question
 
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up I just wanted me
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
correction the reason why I get it
 
01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:12.890 align:start position:0%
correction the reason why I get it
moratorium

01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
moratorium
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
during those years that you show us
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
paying off all the things we were
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
constantly growing and enrollment
 
01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
began to realize from 2009 the
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
enrollment is shrinking and it's headed
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
down so we went to a moratorium before
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
that all or something we were building
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
new schools to adapt to new students
 
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
after we got to declining enrollments we
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
said why do we need the kids building
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
was here so we went on the moratorium
 
01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
for those 10 years
 
01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:45.140 align:start position:0%
oh well that makes sense
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
right representative Cascade and you
 
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
have a question yes thank you
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad my question is
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
um Korean technical Ed had a funding
 
01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
source where centers were on a rotation
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for those funds if they
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
were ready for renovation what not and I
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
heard you just mentioned that briefly
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
um does that funding still exist or is
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
building a the only means now to
 
01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
renovate whether it's CTE or regular
 
01:14:14.209 --> 01:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
buildings that funding program still
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
exists they're still on a rotating they
 
01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
still are in a rotating basis and is
 
01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
that funded about the same every year or
 
01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
is that different
 
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know I don't know much
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
about the CTE we skipped it last couple
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
a year or two back uh the we're at the
 
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
end of that rotational about the 28
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
schools or so centers that is an issue
 
01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
which has to be resolved are we going to
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
start that again so in another so many
 
01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
years another 20 years you might get
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
some money to rebuild your CT which is
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
now an antique right so that is a huge
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
problem which we're dealing with here in
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
this area of funding and we will have
 
01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
the Career Tech and people here later on
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
the 17th that's one of the areas that we
 
01:14:59.810 --> 01:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
were looking at with Jeff beard how are
 
01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
we going to perpetuate how we're going
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
to move forward with this uh particular
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
issue of funding these centers you see
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
Salem you see some of those areas which
 
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
are brand new Bedford brand new but you
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
have some that just totally outdated
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
right now and all right okay thank you
 
01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:21.179 align:start position:0%
we got a problem grab San luno thank you
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
um and and thanks um Miss Clark for
 
01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning I was wondering
 
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
if um I'm sort of referring to page um
 
01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
10 of of 11 and um and the the sheet and
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
which one am I looking at well looking
 
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
at all of the um the the projects that
 
01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
are still being paid there seems to be
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
about 120 of them or so and about five
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
of them I think are um our 2013 or more
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
recent and uh just picking on one of
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
them on page 10 and it's um man it's
 
01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
about I don't know 10 or 12 down
 
01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:01.790 align:start position:0%
about I don't know 10 or 12 down
Manchester

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:03.380 align:start position:0%
um Highland golfs
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
renovation which was a 2014 project and
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
um and I'm wondering why it's slated as
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
2014 to 2032 when I thought it was an 80
 
01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.209 align:start position:0%
2014 to 2032 when I thought it was an 80
20.

01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
20.
 
01:16:17.219 --> 01:16:19.130 align:start position:0%
20.
um

01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:21.649 --> 01:16:21.659 align:start position:0%
type of payment plan as opposed to a
 
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.490 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
the Challenger line there so I'm sorry
 
01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:31.460 align:start position:0%
I'm um
 
01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
so that Highland golfs renovation uh
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
2014 to 2032 is there
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
um Bond payments
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
um that's their bond payments well
 
01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
that's their State's contribution to the
 
01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:47.870 align:start position:0%
that's their State's contribution to the
district

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's the States I'm sorry that's the
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
state's contribution but that term that
 
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
those payment years are their term that
 
01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
they that we are making payments on that
 
01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
project it does I'd have to pull the
 
01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:03.980 align:start position:0%
project to see why that's not a solid
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
why why it didn't get extinguished over
 
01:17:08.689 --> 01:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
say two years or three years you know
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
from the the 80 up front oh these are
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
all um this this whole section is these
 
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
are obligated payments these were these
 
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
are not paid in that new format these
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
are all
 
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
um page
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
9 10 and 11. yeah this is a list of the
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
tail payments
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
So when you say 80 20 that's the new
 
01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
structure since 2013.
 
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
since oh okay I see your question now so
 
01:17:44.689 --> 01:17:44.699 align:start position:0%
um in all of these projects were applied
 
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
prior to 2013. these are all projects
 
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
that applied in 2009 or earlier okay
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
there was some I'd have to pull the
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
project why there was a delay in payment
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
it could have been that they went from
 
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
maybe there was two bonds one was five
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
years and this is the remaining of the
 
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
now or maybe the head wait for a boat or
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
something yeah yeah so so these are all
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
the 20-year payment projects
 
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
the term of the bond the term bond yes
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay yeah all right thanks or and it
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't always the term of the bond there
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
are different funding structures where
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
some are a little different than that
 
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
but yes great great thanks I'm going to
 
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
interject just for a second Caitlyn uh
 
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
how much time are you going to work we
 
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
got to get into the other side of this
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
presentation we have about 45 minutes
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
left for Matt uh on school fine the
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
funding formula the adequacy funding
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
formula are there any other questions
 
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:42.659 align:start position:0%
for Amy here this is going to be
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
represent Edwards and then represent
 
01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.910 align:start position:0%
represent Edwards and then represent
Belcher

01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
question is given that we have some
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
consensus revenues at this point if we
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
were to go ahead and pay off the scale
 
01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.790 align:start position:0%
were to go ahead and pay off the scale
early

01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
early
 
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
um assuming that that could be worked
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
out with the bonds would would that
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
accrue any benefits
 
01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
I understand this tale would be the
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
state component of what we owe
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
um and even if we prepaid our share the
 
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:29.780 align:start position:0%
obligation would remain
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
my mistake and this is for someone
 
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure Mark do you have
 
01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:42.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just not sure with the um how that
 
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
would work
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
I am
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
there may be an interest ing
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
if particularly if we can do it one
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
legally and two if it could be done in a
 
01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
way in which occurs to the benefit of
 
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
the local property tax
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
so the real question then gets to be if
 
01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
we can do it
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
would does that even help the local
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
property tax of Affairs because they're
 
01:20:18.410 --> 01:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I the the way to help local talk
 
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers is look at what
 
01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
they're paying as an expense so if
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
they're paying off Bond payments and pay
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
off those ex those Bond payments that
 
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
would help local property taxpayers can
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
limit their liability but yeah
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
mechanically how to do that I'm not sure
 
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
and the the but you are right like I
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
think also what you're asking is you
 
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
know this is this is their state share
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
so if you want to kind of figure out
 
01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
what their local share is
 
01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
um you know if it's a 30 Community they
 
01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
have 70 remaining that they'd still be
 
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
paying not that it wouldn't be helpful I
 
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
think any state any District receiving
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
that my takeaway is if the state pays
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's an obligated share early
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
that does not prove any direct benefit
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
to the local park
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's a way around it
 
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
I don't but I have been told
 
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
um from the municipal Bond Bank that
 
01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
they can't that they'll have to continue
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
to make those payments on their bonds um
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
they can't
 
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
um refinance they can't do anything
 
01:21:23.689 --> 01:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
different with those municipal bonds so
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
they still continue to do that but how
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
maybe there's other mechanisms I just
 
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why we went
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
with the 80 up front
 
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.970 --> 01:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
um and I should mention that as well
 
01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
I'll just reiterate that because I've
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
heard from districts that that the new
 
01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
funding structure of paying 80 up front
 
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
and not only 80 up front but 20 upon
 
01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
completion gives the districts and the
 
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
towns a relief from paying all the
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
interests um off
 
01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
um that as well that's tremendous
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
savings represent Belcher and then we're
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to switch over to Caitlin after
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair I'll keep this
 
01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.149 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair I'll keep this
brief

01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
brief
 
01:22:03.970 --> 01:22:03.980 align:start position:0%
um referencing on page six the
 
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
hierarchicalistic of projects by need
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just curious for example uh
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
number one here Rochester uh in section
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
c it documents due to building physical
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
security safety and deficiencies now I
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
would assume that there is uh that there
 
01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
is much more comprehensive documentation
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
on those things and how would we go
 
01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
about getting all that if we wanted to
 
01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.649 align:start position:0%
about getting all that if we wanted to
um

01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
um some of the security information is
 
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
marked confidential but for the most
 
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.270 align:start position:0%
marked confidential but for the most
part

01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
um you can the full applications and
 
01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
you're right there the applications are
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of pages so
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
um that is all in my office
 
01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
electronically so if you had any
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
questions happy to help you out with
 
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:40.970 align:start position:0%
questions happy to help you out with
that

01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you we will be discussing that
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
issue uh when we look at the public
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund and much of
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
the discussion in the allocating those
 
01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
grants out we had a total of about 28.5
 
01:22:58.090 --> 01:22:58.100 align:start position:0%
million dollars several years ago we had
 
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
3.3 million dollars which wasn't used in
 
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
that fund it was matched with some
 
01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
gopher money so now this year we have
 
01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:06.620 align:start position:0%
about 13.3
 
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
and that's all done in closed session
 
01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
with Homeland Security and the
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
department meeting over there and we
 
01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
just finished a meeting
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
a couple months ago and we will have
 
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
another one coming up shortly here uh so
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
but uh we will have a presentation on
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
the 17th touching into this
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Amy I'm just gonna
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
well Caitlyn's bringing her a mark up
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
here I'm just gonna say you have two
 
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:35.219 align:start position:0%
other handouts you will hear about these
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
programs throughout the year for me but
 
01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
there is a lease Aid handout that is if
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
you don't own your building this is
 
01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
basically Charter Schools a lease aid
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
program to pay for a portion of their
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
lease and then
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
um the safe grant that you are
 
01:23:51.169 --> 01:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
mentioning a lot of that detailed
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
information about security grants
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
um just remember the building Aid is not
 
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
the same thing when you hear about the
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure fund Public
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
School infrastructure fund is mostly
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
about security funding security projects
 
01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
same with the safe Grant
 
01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
um them and building Aid is about school
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
construction so great thank you very
 
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
much Amy
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
we would look forward to working with
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
welcome mark
 
01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
hello everyone for the record my name is
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
Mark Manganiello I am the administrator
 
01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
of the office of school Finance with the
 
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Education you should all
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
have a handout that says School Finance
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
presentation and anyone in the audience
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
I have some extra copies uh on the first
 
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
chair there
 
01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
so School Finance is a big before Marcos
 
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
everybody should know that Mark came
 
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
from LBA
 
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
and so he's pretty much on top of this
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
stuff are my training from the
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
legislature and I was really grateful
 
01:24:50.209 --> 01:24:50.219 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to train me and now
 
01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to be with the executive
 
01:24:54.169 --> 01:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
branch but also still support all of you
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
the school funding is it's a big topic
 
01:24:58.490 --> 01:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
to cover it's a big topic to cover in 45
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
minutes there's a lot of people in this
 
01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
room who have been studying it for years
 
01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.050 align:start position:0%
room who have been studying it for years
decades

01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
decades
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
um there's still interesting questions
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
that come up that stump us there's
 
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
changes in law there are changes in data
 
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
so as you're learning this stuff don't
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
be discouraged if you struggle to
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
understand it some of it is not
 
01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
intuitive some of it is complex but just
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
keep trying and keeps working through
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
the the information and work with the
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
department and work with your colleagues
 
01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
to understand this issue as you study
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
school funding
 
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
so if you go to page two
 
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see a state summary of Revenue
 
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
and expenditures
 
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
I always start with this document
 
01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
whenever I do a school Finance training
 
01:25:39.169 --> 01:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
because it shows you the full scope of
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
really the economy of our district
 
01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
public school system and so if you look
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
at the top
 
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
the top bold number there you'll see in
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
22 fiscal year 22 our public school
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
districts received 3.6 billion dollars
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
in funding and so just put that number
 
01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
in context the New Hampshire economy is
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
north of 80 billion so our district
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
Public Schools represent about four
 
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
percent of the New Hampshire economy so
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's a little fun fact that I
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
like to share but the reason why I start
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
with this document is because a lot of
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
people want to know how their schools
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
are funded and so this is a Statewide a
 
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
summary in aggregate but if you look at
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
that Top Line you'll see local taxation
 
01:26:23.629 --> 01:26:23.639 align:start position:0%
so this is your local education property
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
taxes so the typical taxpayer pays for
 
01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
property taxes uh they pay a municipal
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
tax a county tax those have nothing to
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
do with schools and then they pay a
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
local education tax which is a local tax
 
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
and then they pay something called the
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
swept which is a Statewide education
 
01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
property tax so those last two deal with
 
01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
funding our schools with property taxes
 
01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
but if you look at this Top Line local
 
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
taxation that is dealing with the local
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
education property tax so that is one
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
tax out of the four type of taxes a
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
typical property taxpayer pays and so as
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
you kind of look at that line
 
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
um uh you can go from fiscal year 20 to
 
01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 to fiscal year 22 you'll
 
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
see usually on average over the past
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
three years local taxation local
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes have made up 60 percent
 
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
of the funding mix of our Public Schools
 
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
so you can conclude most of our schools
 
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
are funded by local education property
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
taxes so that's the biggest Revenue
 
01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
source for our schools
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
um going further down the second biggest
 
01:27:31.129 --> 01:27:31.139 align:start position:0%
Revenue source is adequacy adequacy Aid
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
so adequacy education Aid um it's it's
 
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
fluctuated a little bit but between 27
 
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
to 28 percent has represented the
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
funding mix of our district public
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
schools and the adequacy formula is our
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
state funding formula there's some other
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
state sources there you can see hover
 
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
around two percent
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
um throughout the past three years and
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
so the third biggest funding source for
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
our schools is federal funding and so
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
this one has
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
um as you know we've had a lot of fund
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
Federal funding coming to our schools
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
we've had three covid related stimulus
 
01:28:05.649 --> 01:28:05.659 align:start position:0%
bills uh they're called cares act
 
01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
Carissa and ARP they all have acronyms
 
01:28:10.729 --> 01:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
and those acronyms within those acronyms
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
are more acronyms there's esser-1 sr2
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
sr3 those are federal funding uh bills
 
01:28:21.290 --> 01:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
that gave Appropriations funding to our
 
01:28:22.570 --> 01:28:22.580 align:start position:0%
District's Public
 
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
our district schools and uh
 
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
um and I believe Charter Schools as well
 
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
I'm drawing a blank on yeah Charter
 
01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
Schools as well uh I I don't run Federal
 
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
programming so I'm drawing a blank on
 
01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
that one sorry
 
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
um but what what's interesting to see is
 
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
if you look at 2020 that's before a lot
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
of those Federal bills came into play
 
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:45.780 align:start position:0%
um some of them were passed right as
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
covet hit at the tail end of fiscal year
 
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
2020. so you'll see Federal funding um
 
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
made up about 4.8 percent of the funding
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
mix of our district Public Schools but
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's grown now to 8.9 percent and that's
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
because those Federal funding bills sr1
 
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
sr2 sr3 represented 650 million dollars
 
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
in potential allocations uh to our
 
01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
districts and the districts need to draw
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
down those Federal revenues so they're
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
going to be drawing down those Federal
 
01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
revenues over the next four years
 
01:29:18.649 --> 01:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
um in totality when we look at all the
 
01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
the whole op all of the funding bills
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
so you'll see now Federal funding is up
 
01:29:29.209 --> 01:29:29.219 align:start position:0%
to 323 million in fiscal year 22.
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
talked about local taxation as the
 
01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
biggest funding source but on to page
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
three the second biggest funding source
 
01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:39.900 align:start position:0%
is State funding
 
01:29:42.649 --> 01:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
so State funding is around a billion
 
01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
dollars it's it's north of a billion
 
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
dollars usually around 1.1 billion
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
dollars each year and so these are all
 
01:29:50.689 --> 01:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
the different state funding programs
 
01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
that go to our schools
 
01:29:54.290 --> 01:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
so there's special education Aid that's
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
for high cost special education students
 
01:29:57.410 --> 01:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go into all these but
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
some of the ones we've talked about
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's building Aid in there but the
 
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
largest one the largest percentage of
 
01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
State funding that goes to schools is
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy so adequacy represents around
 
01:30:09.290 --> 01:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
90 percent of the funding that goes to
 
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
our district Public Schools so out of
 
01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:14.219 align:start position:0%
that 1.1 billion dollars adequacy
 
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
um for fiscal year 23 is 970 million so
 
01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
it's uh the substantial share of State
 
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
funding that goes to our school and
 
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
that's why it's important to understand
 
01:30:25.970 --> 01:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
the adequacy formula since it's uh such
 
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:27.900 align:start position:0%
a big portion of State funding to
 
01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:29.270 align:start position:0%
a big portion of State funding to
schools

01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:30:30.530 --> 01:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I'll point out is
 
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
these programs um for some of the people
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
um who've been on maybe looking at
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
school funding for a while it's always
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
important to remember that some of these
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
programs like building Aid were funded
 
01:30:43.129 --> 01:30:43.139 align:start position:0%
by the general fund but now those are
 
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
highlighted gray back in fiscal year 18
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
and fiscal year 19 but moving forward
 
01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:50.219 align:start position:0%
now almost all of these programs are
 
01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
funded by the education trust fund so
 
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
most of all adequacies funded by the
 
01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and now building
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
Aid Public School infrastructure
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund all these programs
 
01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
are except for Charter um uh charting
 
01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
Charter building lease Aid all these
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
programs are being drawn down by the
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and not
 
01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
the general fund so moving on to page
 
01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:12.470 align:start position:0%
the general fund so moving on to page
four

01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see a pie graph
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund
 
01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
and so one of the questions I always get
 
01:31:24.169 --> 01:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
asked is I thought lottery funded our
 
01:31:24.179 --> 01:31:25.370 align:start position:0%
asked is I thought lottery funded our
schools

01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
um and I thought they funded all of it
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
um and I'll go they we are very grateful
 
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
that the lottery provides their uh their
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
profits over to the education trust fund
 
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
they make up 12 of the education trust
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
fund Revenue
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
um so they brought in and this is fiscal
 
01:31:41.450 --> 01:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
year 22 from the recently published
 
01:31:44.209 --> 01:31:44.219 align:start position:0%
kafir they brought in 146 million
 
01:31:46.490 --> 01:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
dollars so uh the Lottery Commission
 
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
does does do a good chunk of the
 
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
education trust fund but they do not
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
fully fund the education trust fund the
 
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
education trust fund for the fiscal year
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
closed 22 is uh 1.2 billion dollars and
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
so those that have been around for a
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
while they might remember when the
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
education trust fund couldn't have
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough Revenue to fund
 
01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
adequacy didn't have enough Revenue to
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
fund the programming it was intended to
 
01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
fund and so it would need a transfer
 
01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
from the general fund but um
 
01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
historically the education the New
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy in New Hampshire
 
01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:20.300 align:start position:0%
Revenue has been doing good lately
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
bringing in Surplus after surplus so
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 is no different we have a
 
01:32:28.970 --> 01:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
surplus in the education trust fund of
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
108 million so um
 
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
just to get you an idea of the education
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
trust fund the money coming in it's 1.2
 
01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
billion currently we're going to end the
 
01:32:39.649 --> 01:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
year fiscal year 22 with a surplus of
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
108 million
 
01:32:43.129 --> 01:32:43.139 align:start position:0%
when you look at the money that comes
 
01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund I pointed
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
out Lottery it's 12 percent
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
um the the biggest contributor is
 
01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
something called swept swept is a little
 
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
complicated it's the Statewide education
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
property tax it trips people up a little
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
bit but when we're talking about those
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
four taxes that you pay one of them is
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
swept and how we come up with this
 
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
weptus in statute a number is set a
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
number of 363 million is set and we need
 
01:33:12.649 --> 01:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
to raise as a state 363 million through
 
01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
the Statewide education property tax and
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
the way we do that is we go okay we need
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
to raise 363 million and we apply it
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
against all non-utility property
 
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers in the state and so
 
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
when you take 363 million dollars and
 
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:31.340 align:start position:0%
you apply it against a tax base of 250 C
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
257 billion property values you get a
 
01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
tax rate of a dollar an equalized tax
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
rate effectively of a dollar and 44
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
cents per 1000
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
so every taxpayer is paying us for every
 
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
non-utility taxpayer is paying a swept
 
01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
tax that money is going
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
um it's being financially recorded by
 
01:33:55.490 --> 01:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
the state as coming into the state but
 
01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
it doesn't actually come into the state
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to dive into that a little
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
bit deeper it's complicated and and
 
01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
people it creates some headaches for
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
people and I'll go into it when we talk
 
01:34:06.169 --> 01:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
about the formula and how it flows
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
through our financials but from an
 
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
accounting perspective the swept does
 
01:34:11.689 --> 01:34:11.699 align:start position:0%
come into the state's coffers not
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
literally but as far as a journal entry
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
in our in our books so when you pay your
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
swept tax we at the state are recording
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
that is coming into the education trust
 
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
fund and so that money comes into the
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
education trust fund for fiscal year 22.
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
it was 363 million so that represented
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
29 of the revenue coming into the
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.129 --> 01:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
this is the adequacy formula so this
 
01:34:45.770 --> 01:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
represents in fiscal year uh fiscal year
 
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
23 970 million dollars
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
um in funding for district Public
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
Schools this is the funding formula for
 
01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
district Public Schools
 
01:34:56.570 --> 01:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
and so the way the adequacy formula
 
01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:57.830 align:start position:0%
and so the way the adequacy formula
Works

01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
Works
 
01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
um it is first we have to know where the
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
students live and what what is what
 
01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
municipality uh ultimately taxpayers are
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
living a municipality what municipality
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
is responsible for paying for that
 
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
child's education so any child that is
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of a district public
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
school system to have their education
 
01:35:21.530 --> 01:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
funded is counted towards adequacy and
 
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
so the way we do that is we look at
 
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
where that student is living and we
 
01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
calculate something called the average
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
daily membership we're looking at a full
 
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
school year and we're seeing where was
 
01:35:32.689 --> 01:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
that student
 
01:35:35.209 --> 01:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
um uh being educated essentially or
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
being responsible for being educated so
 
01:35:40.729 --> 01:35:40.739 align:start position:0%
um some of you have live in districts uh
 
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
you have school districts in community
 
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
that don't have schools but if the Stu
 
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
the student is in your District you are
 
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for educating them and
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
that's where adequacy goes goes to the
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
community that is responsible for paying
 
01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
for that student that is an important
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
distinction to make egg
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
but the way we calculate adequacy is
 
01:35:59.330 --> 01:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
we'll look at say we have a student
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
living in Concord attending this Concord
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
school system and the Concord school
 
01:36:06.649 --> 01:36:06.659 align:start position:0%
system has a 180 day calendar school
 
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
calendar year and they're in Concord for
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
90 days so basically they're in Concord
 
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
for half the time 90 days out of 180
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
days so we would say that is that one
 
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
student has actually 0.5 of a student or
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
0.5 of an average daily membership for
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
Concord but now say that student left
 
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
the state then there are another State's
 
01:36:28.129 --> 01:36:28.139 align:start position:0%
responsibility they're not our state any
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility so Concord would get 0.5
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
but say that student went from Concord
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
for 90 days and say they went to Dover
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
for the other 90 days so we have 180 Day
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
School calendar year 90 days in Concord
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
Concord gets 0.5 of a student Dover gets
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
the other 0.5 of a student so in
 
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
totality it's one student but we track
 
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
the student where they are being
 
01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:49.629 align:start position:0%
the student where they are being
educated

01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
educated
 
01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
districts provide us that information
 
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
and that's how we calculate adequacy so
 
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
we have fractions of students that were
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
calculate adequacy to
 
01:37:01.129 --> 01:37:01.139 align:start position:0%
so when we measure what a student is
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
and we know where the student lives we
 
01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
start calculating adequacy and so when
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
we do one full student so say that
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
student State and conquered the full
 
01:37:11.209 --> 01:37:11.219 align:start position:0%
year we would go okay that's one student
 
01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
that was in Concord the full year their
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
base adequacy Aid amount when we're
 
01:37:18.850 --> 01:37:18.860 align:start position:0%
doing the funding formula is
 
01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
3866.18 this is for fiscal year 24. in
 
01:37:26.110 --> 01:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
the last two fiscals years uh it was
 
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
3786 dollars so we had a CPI adjustment
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
that occurs every two years so this is
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
the latest funding formula for 24. it's
 
01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:35.659 align:start position:0%
now up to
 
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
3866 dollars for each student and so
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
we'll look at that student and we'll go
 
01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
okay this school is entitled to
 
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
3866.18 for educating that student but
 
01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
then we're going to look at more
 
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
additional demographic information from
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
that about that student if that student
 
01:37:53.689 --> 01:37:53.699 align:start position:0%
is experiencing poverty meaning they are
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
fnr eligible they are free and reduced
 
01:37:58.729 --> 01:37:58.739 align:start position:0%
price meal eligible which means they are
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
within 185 percent of the federal
 
01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
poverty guidelines they are eligible for
 
01:38:05.410 --> 01:38:05.420 align:start position:0%
the their their school lunch program
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's a poverty metric as well as a
 
01:38:09.410 --> 01:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
program that's being implemented by
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
schools if they are f r eligible then in
 
01:38:14.590 --> 01:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
addition to that 3
 
01:38:17.890 --> 01:38:17.900 align:start position:0%
866.18 we also provide
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
1933 dollars
 
01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
and eight cents for that student then we
 
01:38:24.290 --> 01:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
keep looking at that student and see if
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's any more demographic information
 
01:38:27.050 --> 01:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
that we can determine about that student
 
01:38:29.209 --> 01:38:29.219 align:start position:0%
if they have an IEP and are receiving
 
01:38:32.770 --> 01:38:32.780 align:start position:0%
sped services in addition to the
 
01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
3866.18 and in addition to if they
 
01:38:37.490 --> 01:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
happen to be experiencing poverty we
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
would be paying an additional two
 
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
thousand and seventy nine dollars and
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
eighty nine cents uh that if they're
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
sped uh uh receiving sped Services the
 
01:38:47.810 --> 01:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
next metric is English language learner
 
01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
ell so if they are an English language
 
01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
learner uh and receiving those services
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the base adequacy
 
01:38:57.410 --> 01:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
potentially in addition to f r adequacy
 
01:38:59.450 --> 01:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
potentially in addition to sped adequacy
 
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
um and then lastly the last one's a
 
01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
little complicated
 
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
um if the student is not fnr eligible
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
not sped up not receiving sped services
 
01:39:16.729 --> 01:39:16.739 align:start position:0%
not an English language learner and
 
01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
they're in third grade and they scored
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
below proficient on the third grade
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
reading test
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
um then we pay
 
01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
756.43 for that student so that's not a
 
01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
lot of students relatively speaking
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
because it's a very unique measurement
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
so we're doing all these we're doing all
 
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
these calculating all these grants for
 
01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
each student and we're tallying up all
 
01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:38.699 align:start position:0%
the students so you have more than one
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
student in your school district we're
 
01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
telling this up for hundreds and
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
thousands of students within your school
 
01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
district and we're trying to come up
 
01:39:47.209 --> 01:39:47.219 align:start position:0%
with an uh a metric and that metric is
 
01:39:49.729 --> 01:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
once we tally up all these
 
01:39:51.649 --> 01:39:51.659 align:start position:0%
um base adequacy AIDS and what we call
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
differential Aid which is f and R and
 
01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
sped we're coming up with a something
 
01:39:57.050 --> 01:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
called the cost of an adequate education
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
and so we call this sometimes called
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
this constitutional adequacy this is
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
what the state has determined we need to
 
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
fund our schools at in order to provide
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
an adequate education we need to tally
 
01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
up all these students and all these
 
01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
demographic information metrics and we
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
need to come up with what is the cost of
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
an adequate education uh based on those
 
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
metrics that's under state law
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
so if we tallied up all those metrics
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
and we determined that your your
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
community's cost of inadequate education
 
01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
was a million dollars then we have to
 
01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
make sure you have a million dollars in
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
funding so you can provide an adequate
 
01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:29.810 align:start position:0%
funding so you can provide an adequate
education

01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:31.860 align:start position:0%
but before we do that before we just
 
01:40:33.649 --> 01:40:33.659 align:start position:0%
give your community a million dollars
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
what we do is we look to see what your
 
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
community raised through the swept the
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax so for
 
01:40:42.649 --> 01:40:42.659 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um uh the fiscal year that
 
01:40:44.689 --> 01:40:44.699 align:start position:0%
just happened or the tax rate that just
 
01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
went out uh
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's a dollar forty four per thousand
 
01:40:51.050 --> 01:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
so we'll look at how much did that tax
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
tax levy bring in for your community and
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
so say your cost of an adequate
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
education is a million dollars we owe
 
01:40:58.850 --> 01:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
you a million dollars but say that swept
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
tax levy brings in 500 000 then we know
 
01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
that that's that swept tax levy is going
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
to go to your school district it's
 
01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:08.699 align:start position:0%
collected by your local tax collector
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
and they cut a check to your school
 
01:41:12.890 --> 01:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
district so now your school district has
 
01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
the swept Revenue that was brought in by
 
01:41:16.669 --> 01:41:16.679 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers and so if the cost of
 
01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
inadequate education is a million
 
01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
dollars the swept brought in five
 
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars for your school
 
01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
then the state needs to cut you a check
 
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
for five hundred thousand dollars so you
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
have the 500 000 in swept and the five
 
01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars uh 500 000 in adequacy
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
to get you to the one million dollars
 
01:41:34.729 --> 01:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
that we are obligated to pay you so
 
01:41:36.649 --> 01:41:36.659 align:start position:0%
that's how way that's how most districts
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
work most districts they're swept is
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
less than their cost of an adequate
 
01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.070 align:start position:0%
less than their cost of an adequate
education

01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
um where it can get a little tricky uh
 
01:41:45.239 --> 01:41:46.010 align:start position:0%
um where it can get a little tricky uh
or

01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
um uh or this is not most of the towns
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
most of the towns followed that thing
 
01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:51.530 align:start position:0%
most of the towns followed that thing
um is

01:41:51.530 --> 01:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
um is
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes a swept is greater than your
 
01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education and so
 
01:41:58.970 --> 01:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
what in that scenario is your cost of an
 
01:42:00.770 --> 01:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
adequate education is a million dollars
 
01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
but your swept tax levy is 1.5 million
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
dollars we as the state have decided
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
determined that you have at a minimum
 
01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
that one million dollars you needed to
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
provide a cost of an adequate education
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
so you're going to get the full 1.5
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
million that was raised by your
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it's going to go to your
 
01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
school district so you'll have a grant
 
01:42:21.290 --> 01:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
of at least a million dollars you'll
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
have a grant of 1.5 million dollars the
 
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
state will not cut you a check under the
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
scenario because you have 1.5 million
 
01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
coming from your taxpayers that is
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
collected locally stays locally and
 
01:42:34.490 --> 01:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
never actually comes to the state
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
um and so for uh some of the veterans
 
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
have heard this 10 years ago there was
 
01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
something a concept called donor towns
 
01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
and so that when people say donor towns
 
01:42:47.209 --> 01:42:47.219 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist anymore under the
 
01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
school funding formula so what used to
 
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
happen is if your cost of an adequate
 
01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
education was a million dollars and your
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
swept was 1.5 million the state would
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
take 500 000 and bring it into the
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and so
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
um uh communities would call that a
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
donation and they would call themselves
 
01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:07.139 align:start position:0%
donor towns
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
um so that law changed 10 years ago so
 
01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
that doesn't occur so any money you
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
raise through your sweat is 100
 
01:43:15.169 --> 01:43:15.179 align:start position:0%
maintained locally none of it goes to
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
the state so there's no such thing as
 
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
Dumber towns but sometimes you'll hear
 
01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:20.699 align:start position:0%
uh the expression dollar Town
 
01:43:21.649 --> 01:43:21.659 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's used correctly
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not used correctly
 
01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
um but just something to to further
 
01:43:26.689 --> 01:43:26.699 align:start position:0%
study and understand
 
01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
um if you if you keep hearing that term
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
or you want to learn more about that
 
01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.410 align:start position:0%
or you want to learn more about that
term

01:43:30.410 --> 01:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the sort of normal adequacy
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
formula we call that constitutional
 
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:38.219 align:start position:0%
adequacy but the formula is not done
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
um there's three additional grants that
 
01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
communities are potentially eligible for
 
01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
one of those grants is relief Aid which
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
was enacted in fiscal year 22. and the
 
01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
way that Grant works is it's based on
 
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
your fnr percentage so the poverty
 
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
percentage in your community and if your
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
poverty percentage is greater than 12
 
01:43:57.649 --> 01:43:57.659 align:start position:0%
percent then you are eligible for a
 
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty dollars per each f r
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
student in your community and that way
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
that Grant works is it's on a sliding
 
01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
scale basis so it reaches a maximum of
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
if your community is 48 f r 48 poverty
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
or greater you receive 600 for each fnr
 
01:44:16.129 --> 01:44:16.139 align:start position:0%
student and so
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
um it scales up so the more higher the
 
01:44:20.209 --> 01:44:20.219 align:start position:0%
poverty the higher the grant uh up until
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
you hit 48 and that Grant is pro-rated
 
01:44:25.729 --> 01:44:25.739 align:start position:0%
so the state does not spend more or less
 
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
than 17.5 million the state will spend
 
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
exactly 17.5 million so we adjust the
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
numbers to make sure the state only
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
spends exactly 17.5 million
 
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
um in that uh existed it started in
 
01:44:40.729 --> 01:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 in existing current law
 
01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
on perpetuity extraordinary needs Grant
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
is a new grant that was enacted in
 
01:44:47.570 --> 01:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23. the way that brand works
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
is it looks at both um poverty metrics
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
and property value metrics so uh first
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
it calculates your equalized valuation
 
01:44:58.609 --> 01:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
per F per fnr student and the way that's
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
calculated is we look at your property
 
01:45:01.689 --> 01:45:01.699 align:start position:0%
tax base
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
on an equalized basis and we divide it
 
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
by the number of f r students in your
 
01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:07.189 align:start position:0%
by the number of f r students in your
community

01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
and that gets us a metric and so if you
 
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
have low property values or high f r
 
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
students the number is going to be lower
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
because the numerator is property values
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
the denominator is f and R students so
 
01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
if you have a lot of f r students that's
 
01:45:21.169 --> 01:45:21.179 align:start position:0%
going to make the the number lower and
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
if you have low property value that's
 
01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
going to make the number lower so if
 
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
your F equalized valuation over F and R
 
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
is one million dollars then you receive
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
a grant of 650 for each fnr student
 
01:45:36.109 --> 01:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
um if your equalized valuation is
 
01:45:38.689 --> 01:45:38.699 align:start position:0%
greater than 6 million uh equalized
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
valuation per F in our student is
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
greater than 6 million then you receive
 
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
zero dollars in this grant
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
um and that works also on a sliding
 
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
scale basis so depending on where your
 
01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per up in our
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
student lands you get anywhere between
 
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
zero dollars to six hundred and fifty
 
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
dollars for each equalized value uh each
 
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
fnr student and um something with that
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
Grant and it requires an accountability
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
plan so in order to complete that uh in
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
order to receive that Grant you uh the
 
01:46:06.410 --> 01:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
school district doesn't need to complete
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
an accountability plan and um tell uh
 
01:46:12.649 --> 01:46:12.659 align:start position:0%
tell the public how they plan to uh use
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
those funds to improve student outcomes
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
and student growth
 
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
that's the extraordinary needs Grant and
 
01:46:19.609 --> 01:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
that exists in the current funding
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
um the stabilization Grant the
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant
 
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
um is 158 million dollars uh
 
01:46:31.729 --> 01:46:31.739 align:start position:0%
approximately and the way you get a
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant is there were
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
changes to the school funding formula
 
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh that went in effect in 2012. they
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
went in effect in 2012 in some
 
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
communities the changes to the funding
 
01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:43.430 align:start position:0%
communities the changes to the funding
formula

01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
formula
 
01:46:46.729 --> 01:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
um resulted in them losing uh receiving
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
less money than they did in fiscal year
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
2011. and so what the legislature
 
01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
decided to do was they would hold them
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
harmless in any funding you received in
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
2011 you would not receive any less
 
01:46:59.450 --> 01:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
funding in 2012. and so in order to hold
 
01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
all those uh communities harmless it
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
cost back in 2012 it cost 158 million
 
01:47:07.490 --> 01:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
dollars so that is a stabilization Grant
 
01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's kind of Frozen in time
 
01:47:12.169 --> 01:47:12.179 align:start position:0%
and it's based on if you what was the
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant in 2012 and if your
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
community received one so some
 
01:47:17.450 --> 01:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
communities don't receive a
 
01:47:19.129 --> 01:47:19.139 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant because they were
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
not held harmless in 2012 when there was
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
changes to the formula some communities
 
01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.729 align:start position:0%
changes to the formula some communities
did

01:47:24.729 --> 01:47:24.739 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:47:27.410 --> 01:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
and that is when you tally those all up
 
01:47:30.169 --> 01:47:30.179 align:start position:0%
you get the adequacy formula so it's
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
cost of inadequate Education Plus those
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
additional grants equals the adequacy
 
01:47:36.890 --> 01:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
funding formula and so I don't know
 
01:47:39.410 --> 01:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
usually uh I stopped for questions here
 
01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:40.609 align:start position:0%
usually uh I stopped for questions here
but

01:47:40.609 --> 01:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
I'll keep I'll keep going representative
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
if that's is there anybody right now
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
that has uh an a question regarding what
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
Mark has just gone through everything
 
01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
from face adequacy to differentiated Aid
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
to the grants that are done the bottom
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
part here accountability and all that
 
01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you Mr chairman
 
01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mark
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
could you just touch on uh the second
 
01:48:11.209 --> 01:48:11.219 align:start position:0%
year of this biennium there was a cut in
 
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
the swept from 363 million to 262
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
million could you uh just briefly talk
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
about that cut and the impact yes so
 
01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
swept is normally set in statute at 363
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
million but there was a language in hb2
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
for the 2223 budget that temporarily
 
01:48:34.970 --> 01:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
made the swept not 363 million but made
 
01:48:37.729 --> 01:48:37.739 align:start position:0%
it 263 million and there was also
 
01:48:40.370 --> 01:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
language there was a swept hold harmless
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
Grant uh in hb2 and so a lot of people
 
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
when they heard that swept was being cut
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
they didn't know what that meant they
 
01:48:50.330 --> 01:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
thought they know that swept goes from
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
their local taxpayers to their schools
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
so they thought it was a school funding
 
01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
cup but it was not a school funding cut
 
01:48:58.490 --> 01:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
it was a property tax cut and the way
 
01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
that works mechanically the way it works
 
01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
with the adequacy formula
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
um I can kind of be sometimes difficult
 
01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
to understand and but I'll walk you
 
01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
through a scenario if your cost of an
 
01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
adequate education is a million dollars
 
01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
and your swept is normally five hundred
 
01:49:13.790 --> 01:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars then the state normally
 
01:49:17.570 --> 01:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
Cuts you a check of 500 000 but if your
 
01:49:19.129 --> 01:49:19.139 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education is a
 
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
and your swept now is not five hundred
 
01:49:23.570 --> 01:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars let's say it drops down
 
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
to make the math easy two hundred and
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars now the state
 
01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
cuts you a check of seven hundred and
 
01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars so when you
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
reduce swept for most communities
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
automatically the adequacy formula will
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
require the state to pick up the slack
 
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
essentially and fund your schools to
 
01:49:42.590 --> 01:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
make up the difference so what that
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
means at the end of the day is if the
 
01:49:47.090 --> 01:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
state's picking up the tab and the
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers are paying less then
 
01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
it's a property tax cut for swept
 
01:49:53.330 --> 01:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so that's how it works there
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
was also a feature in that uh changes in
 
01:49:59.090 --> 01:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
hp2 one-time changes in hb2 by the way
 
01:50:01.129 --> 01:50:01.139 align:start position:0%
this goes into a this is only exists in
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23
 
01:50:04.609 --> 01:50:04.619 align:start position:0%
um did not exist in 22 does not exist in
 
01:50:06.530 --> 01:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
current launder 24.
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
um there was also a feature in there
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
that if your swept was if your costume
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
inadequate education was a million your
 
01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
swept was let's say 1.5 million normally
 
01:50:17.810 --> 01:50:17.820 align:start position:0%
you would get 1.5 million
 
01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
um from your sweat property taxpayers
 
01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
but if we come the swept down to let's
 
01:50:26.450 --> 01:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
say for that Community 1.2 1.25 million
 
01:50:29.810 --> 01:50:29.820 align:start position:0%
you would receive uh 250 000 less
 
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
funding to your uh uh to your school
 
01:50:36.050 --> 01:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
district so um that would be um uh
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
considered not a property tax cut uh
 
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
your local taxpayers would have to make
 
01:50:41.810 --> 01:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
it up holding all things else equal so
 
01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
what the hp2 also had was a swept
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
reduction hold harmless Grant which
 
01:50:48.649 --> 01:50:48.659 align:start position:0%
required the state to pay 250 000 to
 
01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
bring that Community back up to the 1.5
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
million what they would have received
 
01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:56.530 align:start position:0%
million what they would have received
normally

01:50:56.530 --> 01:50:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.850 --> 01:50:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
um any why don't you keep going and
 
01:51:04.129 --> 01:51:04.139 align:start position:0%
finish this up and then we can have some
 
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
questions at the end so so on on page
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
six is an adequacy history
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh adequacy is a long history uh
 
01:51:16.729 --> 01:51:16.739 align:start position:0%
I won't go through all this but you can
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
um if starting on page 20
 
01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
um it might be uh interesting to look at
 
01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:23.750 align:start position:0%
um it might be uh interesting to look at
um

01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
the only additional Aid component oh
 
01:51:28.129 --> 01:51:28.139 align:start position:0%
sorry not page 20 Page Six line twenty
 
01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh page six line twenty shows you the
 
01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
history of the additional additional Aid
 
01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
components of the adequacy formula so
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
line 20 shows you stabilization so back
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2015 the only real um uh
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
besides the I won't go too much into the
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
weeds there but stabilization was the
 
01:51:48.590 --> 01:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
primary uh additional Aid component of
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
the formula
 
01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
and if you follow it you can see that
 
01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
there was a reduction in stabilization
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
it was uh supposed to uh phase out over
 
01:51:59.810 --> 01:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
25 years under uh uh under law but that
 
01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
law was uh amended to bring
 
01:52:04.729 --> 01:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
stabilization back up to the full amount
 
01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
um so brought up to approximately back
 
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
up to that 158 Million number
 
01:52:11.209 --> 01:52:11.219 align:start position:0%
um and then if you look at fiscal year
 
01:52:14.689 --> 01:52:14.699 align:start position:0%
21 fiscal year 22 fiscal year 23 24. a
 
01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
lot of these new components of the
 
01:52:18.050 --> 01:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
formula the formula has been changing a
 
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
lot each year so it's a lot to keep
 
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
track of this document just shows you
 
01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
that the formula has been changing
 
01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:27.179 align:start position:0%
pretty much every year and so it um if
 
01:52:28.729 --> 01:52:28.739 align:start position:0%
you want to know those changes you can
 
01:52:30.169 --> 01:52:30.179 align:start position:0%
use this document to sort of study the
 
01:52:36.370 --> 01:52:36.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
so I just got some informational Pages
 
01:52:43.129 --> 01:52:43.139 align:start position:0%
at the end there's two informational uh
 
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
documents at the end one of them I think
 
01:52:47.930 --> 01:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
is kind of neat I don't know if um some
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
of you some of you that pay property
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
taxes you might go to you might get your
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
property tax bill and you might go to
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
the dra website and you might want to
 
01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
see how your your community compares to
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
your uh your peers your fellow
 
01:52:58.440 --> 01:52:59.570 align:start position:0%
your uh your peers your fellow
communities

01:52:59.570 --> 01:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
um and that's a decent methodology to
 
01:53:04.490 --> 01:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
compare your tax rate with your uh your
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
neighbors your neighboring towns but um
 
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
this is a document that the Department
 
01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
of Education published publishes and
 
01:53:13.729 --> 01:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
what it does is on the far right columns
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
it does something called uh what I would
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
call is an equalized tax rate and so
 
01:53:19.729 --> 01:53:19.739 align:start position:0%
when you're comparing tax rates between
 
01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
communities you you make a lot of
 
01:53:23.209 --> 01:53:23.219 align:start position:0%
assumptions and we can get into the
 
01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
weeds of all the different variables
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
that could impact the tax rate but one
 
01:53:27.649 --> 01:53:27.659 align:start position:0%
of those assumptions you make when you
 
01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
compare your tax rate to another
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
community's tax rate is you assume that
 
01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
Community has the same assessing
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
practices and that is not true each
 
01:53:37.609 --> 01:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
Community has their own assessing
 
01:53:40.129 --> 01:53:40.139 align:start position:0%
approach and methodology and so
 
01:53:41.570 --> 01:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
something this Department of Revenue
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
Administration does is they tried to
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
take all property values and bring them
 
01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
up to a market value and that's the
 
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
equalization process so um if you're if
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
you're one of the people that like to
 
01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
look at your tax rate and compare it to
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
your neighbors
 
01:53:56.689 --> 01:53:56.699 align:start position:0%
um I I suggest looking at this report
 
01:53:58.850 --> 01:53:58.860 align:start position:0%
because this at the far right column
 
01:54:01.609 --> 01:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
there it doesn't equalize tax rate so it
 
01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
Compares tax rates between communities
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
assuming that they have uh it tries to
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh control for different assessing
 
01:54:12.050 --> 01:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
practices so it's just a new a neat way
 
01:54:14.209 --> 01:54:14.219 align:start position:0%
a neat way to compare your tax rate to
 
01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
your peers
 
01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
um and you can you can have fun if
 
01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
you're if a policy walk in that area you
 
01:54:21.649 --> 01:54:21.659 align:start position:0%
can have fun digging into that the other
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
informational thing I added
 
01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:24.470 align:start position:0%
informational thing I added
um

01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
every year the department receives
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
financial data and we process it we're
 
01:54:31.129 --> 01:54:31.139 align:start position:0%
still in the process of uh this is on
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
page 16.
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
um we're still in the process of
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
processing some of the financial data
 
01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
we've received from the districts we
 
01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
hope to publish today a lot of our uh
 
01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
annual reports that people uh tend to
 
01:54:45.169 --> 01:54:45.179 align:start position:0%
tend to like and are popular one of them
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
being cost per pupil
 
01:54:48.649 --> 01:54:48.659 align:start position:0%
um so this is fiscal year 21
 
01:54:50.570 --> 01:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year 22 is going to be
 
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
published probably today uh we're still
 
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
doing some quality control work on it
 
01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:56.090 align:start position:0%
doing some quality control work on it
um

01:54:56.090 --> 01:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:59.090 --> 01:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
so cost per people uh a metric that
 
01:55:01.970 --> 01:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
people like to look at um all it is is
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's current expenditures over students
 
01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
so um sometimes you use cost per people
 
01:55:08.689 --> 01:55:08.699 align:start position:0%
as a measure of efficiency is
 
01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
essentially how many research resources
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
do you allocate per student so some
 
01:55:15.410 --> 01:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
communities um I'll allocate a lot of
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
resources per student
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
using this metric some communities don't
 
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
allocate a lot of resources on a per
 
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
student basis so it's just a
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
standardized way to kind of compare your
 
01:55:27.649 --> 01:55:27.659 align:start position:0%
school district to your peers
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
um uh looking at kind of that efficiency
 
01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:31.010 align:start position:0%
um uh looking at kind of that efficiency
measurement

01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
measurement
 
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
and so that's just an informational
 
01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
piece that you can look at
 
01:55:37.970 --> 01:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
is that material come from the doe 25
 
01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
form your cost per pupil and if so
 
01:55:43.370 --> 01:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
um how do you discern the difference
 
01:55:45.649 --> 01:55:45.659 align:start position:0%
between between District a and District
 
01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
B over here or town A and B when B is
 
01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
got all the extra things expenses thrown
 
01:55:56.169 --> 01:55:56.179 align:start position:0%
into it which are not adequate oriented
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
so the costs like they're spending all
 
01:56:02.090 --> 01:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
this but it may be for the football team
 
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
so we don't we uh the department has
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
something called the doe 25 it's a
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
financial report that districts submit
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
to us it has a lot of data on it it has
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
2500 cells but it does not have that
 
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
granular data um it does have some it
 
01:56:18.770 --> 01:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
does have some granular data but it
 
01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
can't really get to what representative
 
01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:23.219 align:start position:0%
Vlad is is um asking um a lot of it's
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
rolled up so uh we do have some
 
01:56:26.570 --> 01:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
financial information that we've
 
01:56:28.129 --> 01:56:28.139 align:start position:0%
provided to you
 
01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
um it's it's meant to summarize and roll
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
up the doe 25 is important in setting
 
01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.189 align:start position:0%
up the doe 25 is important in setting
taxes

01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
um and it's important in doing
 
01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
analytical work but um we do not have
 
01:56:38.689 --> 01:56:38.699 align:start position:0%
the information that that you're looking
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
at and we're just looking at current
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
expenditures over pupils and we're not
 
01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
parsing out different programmatic
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
pieces within that school district
 
01:56:48.410 --> 01:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mark
 
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thanks
 
01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh thanks Mark for joining us this
 
01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:55.970 align:start position:0%
uh thanks Mark for joining us this
morning

01:56:55.970 --> 01:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
um on
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
um on Page Six
 
01:57:01.729 --> 01:57:01.739 align:start position:0%
uh I I am referencing
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
um uh row 13. I'm sorry not row 13. row
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
seven I was wondering if you could talk
 
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
about where those students when those
 
01:57:15.410 --> 01:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
students counts were uh were taken and
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
how they apply to uh to calculating
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
um the adequacy Grant in the um in those
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
years yes that's a good question and I I
 
01:57:25.850 --> 01:57:25.860 align:start position:0%
don't think I mentioned that
 
01:57:29.089 --> 01:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
um adequacy we spend uh the school year
 
01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
we use to calculate the adequacy Grant
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
in any given fiscal year the student
 
01:57:35.570 --> 01:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
data is always one year behind that is
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
different than charter school program
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
that is different than the EFA program
 
01:57:42.109 --> 01:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
so um when you look at those metrics uh
 
01:57:43.729 --> 01:57:43.739 align:start position:0%
hopefully I'm doing it right yes when
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
you look at that um hopefully I line
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
them up correctly uh yeah so though if
 
01:57:50.330 --> 01:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
we look at uh fiscal year 21
 
01:57:54.169 --> 01:57:54.179 align:start position:0%
um that 167 000 adms on line seven of
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
that document that represents school
 
01:57:59.689 --> 01:57:59.699 align:start position:0%
year 2020. and so a a something that's
 
01:58:01.729 --> 01:58:01.739 align:start position:0%
going on that impacts school funding is
 
01:58:03.609 --> 01:58:03.619 align:start position:0%
we have declining enrollments
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
the enrollments generally decline at
 
01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
about one percent ish a year that's
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
pretty normal um we can attribute you
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
know you can hypothesize that that's
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
attributed to demographic information
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
people are having less kids so therefore
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
there are less kids in the system school
 
01:58:20.810 --> 01:58:20.820 align:start position:0%
system but during the pandemic we saw a
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
really sharp decrease in student
 
01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:23.639 align:start position:0%
enrollment it was actually a four
 
01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
percent decrease in student enrollment
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
so a lot more than the one percent
 
01:58:29.689 --> 01:58:29.699 align:start position:0%
decline we typically see and so right
 
01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
now looking at the student data the ADM
 
01:58:31.619 --> 01:58:32.689 align:start position:0%
now looking at the student data the ADM
Trends

01:58:32.689 --> 01:58:32.699 align:start position:0%
Trends
 
01:58:32.699 --> 01:58:33.470 align:start position:0%
Trends
um

01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:35.810 --> 01:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
we're kind of back to normal as far as
 
01:58:37.370 --> 01:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
the one percent decline in student
 
01:58:39.530 --> 01:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
enrollments each year
 
01:58:41.810 --> 01:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
um but that four percent we we kind of
 
01:58:43.250 --> 01:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
hypothesized when there was a four
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
percent decrease in enrollment we
 
01:58:47.570 --> 01:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
thought more students might jump back
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
um we didn't know how many I think some
 
01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
of them did some of them temporarily
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
went home school this is a theory I
 
01:58:55.370 --> 01:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
don't have uh uh as a hypothesis some of
 
01:58:57.709 --> 01:58:57.719 align:start position:0%
them did go into home education
 
01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:00.060 align:start position:0%
um some of them did return back did
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
return back to their District We Believe
 
01:59:04.729 --> 01:59:04.739 align:start position:0%
but I'm not not at the not as of three
 
01:59:07.370 --> 01:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
percent so there wasn't a huge jump back
 
01:59:09.890 --> 01:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
in student enrollment at this number so
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
um yes student enrollment is one percent
 
01:59:14.089 --> 01:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh one year behind when
 
01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
calculating adequacy and as you can see
 
01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
there we have some declining enrollment
 
01:59:19.609 --> 01:59:19.619 align:start position:0%
that impacts the funding formula because
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
the funding formula is driven by student
 
01:59:25.850 --> 01:59:25.860 align:start position:0%
council represent Damon
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mark
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to ask about the cost per
 
01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
pupil does it in any way acknowledge
 
01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:34.010 align:start position:0%
pupil does it in any way acknowledge
what

01:59:34.010 --> 01:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:34.790 align:start position:0%
what
um

01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:36.350 --> 01:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
What proportion of the people's or
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
special ed students and the different
 
01:59:39.410 --> 01:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
costs for them
 
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
I think it does not
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
and we have a bill in on that I I got a
 
01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
question for you in terms of where we
 
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
were last year uh with representative
 
01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
umberger uh when we're looking at f r as
 
01:59:55.370 --> 01:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
a de-identifier for poverty uh and now
 
01:59:57.830 --> 01:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
we've also been considering Medicaid
 
01:59:57.840 --> 01:59:59.410 align:start position:0%
we've also been considering Medicaid
direct

01:59:59.410 --> 01:59:59.420 align:start position:0%
direct
 
02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
using that do you have any kind of an
 
02:00:04.189 --> 02:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
estimate or a guesstimate as far as if
 
02:00:06.890 --> 02:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
we used Medicaid as an indicator of
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
poverty would we be receiving X number
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
of dollars in addition in revenue from
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
the feds or or where are we on that oh
 
02:00:20.689 --> 02:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
so if uh we um I didn't mention this in
 
02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
the in the presentation one of the ways
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
to determine poverty is for a student to
 
02:00:26.570 --> 02:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
complete an application and make
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
themselves eligible for the fnr program
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
and access free and reduced price meals
 
02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
within their school another way to
 
02:00:34.129 --> 02:00:34.139 align:start position:0%
become eligible under current law and
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
under current practices is they if they
 
02:00:39.050 --> 02:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
sign up for the TANF program uh uh these
 
02:00:41.330 --> 02:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
are Medica uh DHHS programs like Tana
 
02:00:43.729 --> 02:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
snap if they sign up for some of those
 
02:00:46.129 --> 02:00:46.139 align:start position:0%
DHHS entitlement programs they and they
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
hit the property metrics as defined by
 
02:00:50.689 --> 02:00:50.699 align:start position:0%
the f r program we automatically make
 
02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
them fnr eligible and we count them as a
 
02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
poor a student experiencing poverty NRF
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
and our accounts so there's something
 
02:00:58.250 --> 02:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
called direct certification and there
 
02:01:01.010 --> 02:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
was proposals last year to explore the
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
idea of using Medicaid data to directly
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
certify students in our schools as fnr
 
02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
eligible based on the income data we
 
02:01:10.370 --> 02:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
have from Medicaid or based on Medicaid
 
02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:13.070 align:start position:0%
have from Medicaid or based on Medicaid
eligibility

02:01:13.070 --> 02:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
um so that is a program that the
 
02:01:17.330 --> 02:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
department would uh it's a it's a it's a
 
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
pilot program so it's uh done on an
 
02:01:20.689 --> 02:01:20.699 align:start position:0%
application by application basis for
 
02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
each state uh
 
02:01:25.129 --> 02:01:25.139 align:start position:0%
if we were to enter that program say
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
before the next deadline which I believe
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be September 2023 it would
 
02:01:32.810 --> 02:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
impact fiscal year 26 adequacy I have
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
received some new numbers from DHHS I'm
 
02:01:36.890 --> 02:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
I'm hesitant to throw a number out there
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
but I'll I'll take I'll take a guess so
 
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
this is a really rough estimate I've
 
02:01:42.589 --> 02:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
received new numbers from DHHS and um
 
02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to play with this estimate a
 
02:01:46.129 --> 02:01:46.139 align:start position:0%
little bit more and we're doing a if we
 
02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
get an official fiscal note I'll work
 
02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
with the LBA to to fine tune this number
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
but right now the number I looked at I
 
02:01:53.689 --> 02:01:53.699 align:start position:0%
did some up math it was 42 million
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
um it would cost 42 million in the
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
current Formula but I do need to analyze
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more and and spend
 
02:02:01.609 --> 02:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
some time looking at that number but
 
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm at currently with that
 
02:02:05.330 --> 02:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
I hope our finance people look into that
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
Rick along those lines yes yeah that
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks Mark for
 
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
uh for uh for doing that uh that
 
02:02:17.209 --> 02:02:17.219 align:start position:0%
analytical work
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
um on um on Medicaid direct
 
02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:20.450 align:start position:0%
um on um on Medicaid direct
certification

02:02:20.450 --> 02:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
certification
 
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
um are we also going to learn I mean
 
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
assuming we're going to hold um the that
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid category let's just
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
say flat in terms of
 
02:02:31.790 --> 02:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
um contribution to adequacy Dollars
 
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
obviously the distribution of it would
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
be depending upon
 
02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
how Medicaid you know what the Medicaid
 
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
counts are versus the free and reduced
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
price lunch by so some communities might
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
see ups and downs is the is the analysis
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
going to include that when I was
 
02:02:52.510 --> 02:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
crunching those numbers I assumed every
 
02:02:55.070 --> 02:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid student is already on f r so
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of assumptions that
 
02:02:57.530 --> 02:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
analysis and it's really that's why it's
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
I'm throwing out that number it it is
 
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
this could be aspects of the number that
 
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
are problematic so when you uh if if
 
02:03:06.290 --> 02:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
that bill does come before the committee
 
02:03:07.729 --> 02:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
we'll have a more in-depth conversation
 
02:03:09.050 --> 02:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
and I'll have probably more to share
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
about my analysis and what my analysis
 
02:03:12.410 --> 02:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
can predict and not predict um but yeah
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a thorny issue just modeling
 
02:03:17.209 --> 02:03:17.219 align:start position:0%
it out is uh sure no and thank thanks in
 
02:03:19.010 --> 02:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
advance for the work on that and I I
 
02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:20.820 align:start position:0%
believe Rick there are there's a house
 
02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:23.639 align:start position:0%
bill there is a house and a Senate bill
 
02:03:26.030 --> 02:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
and the Senate bill and we see a
 
02:03:28.609 --> 02:03:28.619 align:start position:0%
significant drop in fnr in the high
 
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
school where high school students are
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
not participating and we're losing out
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
on all those dollars
 
02:03:38.570 --> 02:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
so we need to get on top of that one
 
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
yes reps and Ellison and then
 
02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
represented my wife thank you Mr
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mark for being
 
02:03:46.970 --> 02:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
here uh just a a question about a page
 
02:03:50.209 --> 02:03:50.219 align:start position:0%
two line one uh the local taxation
 
02:03:52.729 --> 02:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
percentage which runs through the three
 
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal years that are there do you have
 
02:03:57.410 --> 02:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
any sense and it runs about 60 percent
 
02:03:59.570 --> 02:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense of where New
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sits on a chart of money
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
provided by local communities for
 
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
schools versus money provided by the
 
02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
state I I can't give you uh an exact
 
02:04:13.250 --> 02:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
ranking um but it's it's up it's we
 
02:04:14.689 --> 02:04:14.699 align:start position:0%
we're sometimes we're I think we're
 
02:04:15.649 --> 02:04:15.659 align:start position:0%
number one
 
02:04:19.070 --> 02:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
um uh number one as far as um uh uh or
 
02:04:21.410 --> 02:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
sorry number one for local taxation
 
02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
contributing to our schools
 
02:04:25.609 --> 02:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
um but yeah we're for most for Most
 
02:04:28.729 --> 02:04:28.739 align:start position:0%
states um uh where or a property tax
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
state and so you can see a lot of
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
metrics out there people analyzing
 
02:04:33.770 --> 02:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
property taxes across all 50 states and
 
02:04:35.930 --> 02:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has higher property taxes
 
02:04:39.229 --> 02:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
than most other states thank you
 
02:04:41.450 --> 02:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative Wiley you're talking
 
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
about free and reduce
 
02:04:44.689 --> 02:04:44.699 align:start position:0%
people are supposed to pay something
 
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
when it's reduced most of them don't and
 
02:04:49.970 --> 02:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
what's the percentage between free and
 
02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:51.770 align:start position:0%
what's the percentage between free and
reduced

02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
02:04:53.629 --> 02:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
oh well I know that I believe the
 
02:04:55.370 --> 02:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
poverty percentage as far as like the
 
02:04:57.290 --> 02:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
actual numbers and counts I don't have
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
but um I believe free is 135 percent of
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty guideline I'm I
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
believe so and then reduced is 185
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
percent of the federal poverty guideline
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
out of those when you go to Medicaid and
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
these the things at 10. are those just
 
02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
for free are they also include if you do
 
02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:19.510 align:start position:0%
for free are they also include if you do
just

02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
and snap
 
02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
windows are all considered free but when
 
02:05:26.689 --> 02:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
we go to Medicaid I do believe we're
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
going to have to parse information into
 
02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
free and reduced we don't know all the
 
02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
logistics in that program right now
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
because we're not participating in it so
 
02:05:35.450 --> 02:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
if we begin to participate we'll get
 
02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
more information
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've got to kind of find the
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
line in there in several schools I think
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
have come to Western said nobody ever
 
02:05:47.930 --> 02:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
pays to reduce 30 and 40 000. deficits
 
02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:48.770 align:start position:0%
pays to reduce 30 and 40 000. deficits
because

02:05:48.770 --> 02:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
if some of the person is getting free
 
02:05:53.149 --> 02:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not paying either even though I do
 
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
just want to point out that is only for
 
02:05:56.089 --> 02:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the meal reimbursement
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
though for the schools as far as the
 
02:06:00.290 --> 02:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid there's poverty is
 
02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:03.410 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid there's poverty is
exactly

02:06:03.410 --> 02:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.930 --> 02:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
yes the filing period with USDA still
 
02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:08.629 align:start position:0%
yes the filing period with USDA still
open

02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.970 --> 02:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
until July
 
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you very much Mark and
 
02:06:15.599 --> 02:06:17.390 align:start position:0%

that's that's always been a hard one for
 
02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:49.390 align:start position:0%
that's that's always been a hard one for
me

02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:58.129 --> 02:18:58.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:58.139 --> 02:19:02.589 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:19:02.589 --> 02:19:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
and finish this off right here at least
 
02:19:07.730 --> 02:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
the morning portion if we can this part
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
should uh be relatively uh simple for us
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go through a couple of the
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
procedures and protocols that we as a
 
02:19:19.790 --> 02:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
body should follow as we're getting into
 
02:19:22.570 --> 02:19:22.580 align:start position:0%
the hearing executive committee process
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
especially in the hearing process the
 
02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
executive sessions are meetings for us
 
02:19:32.570 --> 02:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
to make the decisions on a bill the
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
hearings are for us to hear the voice of
 
02:19:38.509 --> 02:19:38.519 align:start position:0%
the people and and receive that
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
testimony so I just have a couple things
 
02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
I like to you know just reiterate or
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
state those that were here on the
 
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
orientation for newly elected you
 
02:19:52.250 --> 02:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
probably have heard it but you know if
 
02:19:54.050 --> 02:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
you're like myself it takes two or three
 
02:19:55.730 --> 02:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
times at least that's with my wife when
 
02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm listening to her to really
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
comprehend what's being said and so so I
 
02:20:03.650 --> 02:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have said that I know
 
02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'm on my phone my mic's on but I'm
 
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
always you know in the corner
 
02:20:12.349 --> 02:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
so uh and some of the procedures we
 
02:20:15.050 --> 02:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
should be aware of uh I've had
 
02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
committees here you know I I've been on
 
02:20:19.849 --> 02:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
this one now for 14 this going to my
 
02:20:21.889 --> 02:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
15th year on education I've chaired it
 
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
this for six years previously
 
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
um whenever you get a governor walking
 
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
in we will stand up immediately it's a
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
courtesy or the governor's wife uh or a
 
02:20:36.410 --> 02:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
chief justice or somebody of that nature
 
02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
we we want to respect the position uh
 
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
and the in the individual so if uh they
 
02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
come in please respect and and stand up
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
um when we have testimony going on I
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
will always ask for if there's a senator
 
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the room that's a co-sponsor on that
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
get them up and done quickly there's
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
only 24 of them and they got a lot of
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
different committees that they're on so
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
we want to get them in and get them out
 
02:21:07.730 --> 02:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion on the floor
 
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
the other day regarding should there be
 
02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
time limits placed on folks which are
 
02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:13.070 align:start position:0%
time limits placed on folks which are
testifying

02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
02:21:15.469 --> 02:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
that that's an issue which really needs
 
02:21:18.410 --> 02:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of judgment and consideration for
 
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
example if somebody's coming in for
 
02:21:23.330 --> 02:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
example reps on luno has a bill it was
 
02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
1680 last year it's the finance bill and
 
02:21:28.849 --> 02:21:28.859 align:start position:0%
if he's introducing that it's going to
 
02:21:30.410 --> 02:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
take him more than three minutes away
 
02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
through you know 10 14 pages and let us
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
identify what is new what how word this
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
works and that works and so I will allow
 
02:21:42.290 --> 02:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
those people that are prime sponsors to
 
02:21:45.889 --> 02:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
have some time to present their bills if
 
02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
we don't get it explained properly the
 
02:21:49.610 --> 02:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
beginning will be going on and on and on
 
02:21:53.450 --> 02:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
and maybe maybe uh uh making decisions
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
on subjective information rather than
 
02:21:56.809 --> 02:21:56.819 align:start position:0%
really objective stuff that we could
 
02:21:58.969 --> 02:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
have gotten earlier and oftentimes
 
02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's people that come in that have
 
02:22:02.750 --> 02:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
technical advice be it the school boards
 
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
Association or doe or some agency
 
02:22:08.090 --> 02:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security we've had them in here
 
02:22:11.570 --> 02:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
um it might be wise in some cases to
 
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
have them come up front and stay at few
 
02:22:17.150 --> 02:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
things first or maybe at the end but we
 
02:22:19.309 --> 02:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
will have technical advice given to us
 
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that really helps a significant
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
amount saves a lot of time
 
02:22:26.809 --> 02:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
so you see me jumping around like that
 
02:22:29.389 --> 02:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
now if for example on Thursday next week
 
02:22:30.889 --> 02:22:30.899 align:start position:0%
we have a bill coming up which is
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
scheduled for reps Hall
 
02:22:35.389 --> 02:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
we may have a lot of people we may not
 
02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
but we've had bills before where we've
 
02:22:40.969 --> 02:22:40.979 align:start position:0%
had that reps hall for Education totally
 
02:22:40.979 --> 02:22:42.469 align:start position:0%
had that reps hall for Education totally
filled

02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
filled
 
02:22:44.450 --> 02:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
obviously then you have to set time
 
02:22:47.330 --> 02:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
limits and and there have been times so
 
02:22:49.010 --> 02:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
when they initially get in there there's
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
not that many then all of a sudden more
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
come in and you're going to have to set
 
02:22:55.370 --> 02:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
the time limits up I always make a point
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
to try and get those people that drove a
 
02:23:00.410 --> 02:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
long way from Berlin
 
02:23:02.809 --> 02:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
or up Cobra Pittsburgh or down on the
 
02:23:06.349 --> 02:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
border to get up and and present and get
 
02:23:09.469 --> 02:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
testimony and try to get out also those
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
that are families with young kids will
 
02:23:13.849 --> 02:23:13.859 align:start position:0%
try and get them taken care of it's hard
 
02:23:15.530 --> 02:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
for some of these young kids to stay out
 
02:23:17.450 --> 02:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
there for two hours three hours waiting
 
02:23:19.250 --> 02:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
for their mom or their dad
 
02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
or whomever they would to testify so
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
we'll we we'll jump around a little bit
 
02:23:27.170 --> 02:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
so there is it's I guess one shoe
 
02:23:29.210 --> 02:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit all and that's what we try
 
02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
to use a little common sense
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
um going on down here
 
02:23:34.849 --> 02:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have some early bills coming
 
02:23:37.790 --> 02:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
up and people ask me uh are we going to
 
02:23:39.770 --> 02:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
be able to identify specific dates in
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
which we will be meeting at in the
 
02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:42.889 align:start position:0%
which we will be meeting at in the
hearings

02:23:42.889 --> 02:23:42.899 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
are too exact uh we will have a better
 
02:23:48.650 --> 02:23:48.660 align:start position:0%
handle that once we know all these bills
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
if we have bills that come in with a
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
financial note attached to them they're
 
02:23:55.309 --> 02:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
going to be an early bill that means
 
02:23:56.570 --> 02:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
we've got to clean them up and get out
 
02:23:59.210 --> 02:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
of here quickly so we may have to have
 
02:24:01.250 --> 02:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
some days which are really not really
 
02:24:03.050 --> 02:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
announced there will always be put in
 
02:24:04.730 --> 02:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
the calendar and we'll have to live by
 
02:24:07.929 --> 02:24:07.939 align:start position:0%
the the the proper notice for the public
 
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
but uh initially I'm going to try and
 
02:24:13.849 --> 02:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
stay away from Mondays so if you have
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointments and something
 
02:24:17.330 --> 02:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
going on you know that might be a date
 
02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh or I I know that folks like to use
 
02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
Fridays attached to those long they'll
 
02:24:25.130 --> 02:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
make the weekend a little longer and you
 
02:24:27.170 --> 02:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
deserve it I'll try and work that way
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
too but we should have a better handle
 
02:24:31.010 --> 02:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
on this within the next several weeks
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll be able to tell you
 
02:24:35.450 --> 02:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
specifically but for right now try to
 
02:24:37.010 --> 02:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
count on Mondays even though there's
 
02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
going to be other committees and
 
02:24:40.370 --> 02:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
commissions I know I was just talking
 
02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell here and she's
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
looking at a book schedule coming up
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
seeing there's some counsel she like is
 
02:24:49.010 --> 02:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
it the CTE
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and then we had legislative
 
02:24:52.910 --> 02:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
oversight then on the next day and
 
02:24:54.530 --> 02:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
there's these commissions and committees
 
02:24:57.170 --> 02:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
going on all the time if anybody wants
 
02:24:58.490 --> 02:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
to be on a committee or commission let
 
02:25:00.790 --> 02:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
us know because we're glad to put you on
 
02:25:04.190 --> 02:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh some of us are on tilt as a result of
 
02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:05.330 align:start position:0%
uh some of us are on tilt as a result of
that

02:25:05.330 --> 02:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
um going on down some of the things
 
02:25:09.650 --> 02:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
which we have here
 
02:25:11.570 --> 02:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
um all familiar with the orange badges
 
02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
those are the lobbyists
 
02:25:16.370 --> 02:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
now when we're in to a middle of a
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
hearing or start of a hearing I want
 
02:25:21.410 --> 02:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
everybody to be cautious I don't want to
 
02:25:23.690 --> 02:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
hear any would you believe type
 
02:25:26.210 --> 02:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
questions in other words sometimes we
 
02:25:28.429 --> 02:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
don't have a specific question to ask
 
02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
them would you believe that I feel this
 
02:25:33.889 --> 02:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
that's not a question and so we're going
 
02:25:35.450 --> 02:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
to steer away from that stuff there's
 
02:25:37.309 --> 02:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
the smiling face out there from one of
 
02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
our attorneys and and so what we want to
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
do is ask good questions we don't want
 
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
to get into a debate with the test those
 
02:25:49.250 --> 02:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
people testifying they're here to
 
02:25:52.370 --> 02:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
present their position and we're here to
 
02:25:55.730 --> 02:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
listen we're here to listen and yes you
 
02:25:57.650 --> 02:25:57.660 align:start position:0%
may have some judgments made on it but
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's something you don't want to
 
02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
impart during the hearing process
 
02:26:03.530 --> 02:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
you want to be able to ask good direct
 
02:26:06.349 --> 02:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
questions yes but be careful not to get
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
into a debate with the person that's
 
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
there and all questions asked of course
 
02:26:12.110 --> 02:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
have to come to the chair other words
 
02:26:14.690 --> 02:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
you have to wave your hand or and
 
02:26:16.370 --> 02:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's difficult for the chair
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
to see down for example I can't see
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner right now
 
02:26:23.929 --> 02:26:23.939 align:start position:0%
um representative likes to put his hands
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
over like this but but uh but so you
 
02:26:29.389 --> 02:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
have to stick your hand out please and
 
02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
Glenn will try to watch and I will to to
 
02:26:34.610 --> 02:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're we're noticing you
 
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
and recognizing you
 
02:26:39.770 --> 02:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
um if you have a follow-up question
 
02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
for the person that you've asked your
 
02:26:43.969 --> 02:26:43.979 align:start position:0%
first question to and that's it's
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
logical it happens
 
02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
um just remember that follow you have to
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
ask permission for the follow-up
 
02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:50.570 align:start position:0%
ask permission for the follow-up
question

02:26:50.570 --> 02:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:26:52.969 --> 02:26:52.979 align:start position:0%
ninety percent of the time I'll say go
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
for it
 
02:26:55.849 --> 02:26:55.859 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:26:55.859 --> 02:26:57.110 align:start position:0%
all right
um

02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:00.170 --> 02:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
while we're in in session here and we're
 
02:27:01.849 --> 02:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
streaming for the public
 
02:27:05.330 --> 02:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
when we you talk with each other we
 
02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
should use the word representative X
 
02:27:11.210 --> 02:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
representative Y and and I have I have
 
02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
failed at that myself many many times
 
02:27:16.730 --> 02:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
we've been working together for so long
 
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
some of us are friends here and we get
 
02:27:22.849 --> 02:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
used to you know the the ex-speaker of
 
02:27:26.929 --> 02:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
the house who has a camp up in Bethlehem
 
02:27:30.410 --> 02:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
and lives here in Concord he and I met
 
02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
each other on the trail climbing up and
 
02:27:34.670 --> 02:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
up to Lonesome Lake in France uh
 
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
Franconia Notch and so we hike together
 
02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
and we're just you know each first names
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
but when you get down here it's Mr
 
02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:41.750 align:start position:0%
but when you get down here it's Mr
Speaker

02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
02:27:44.510 --> 02:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
our representative
 
02:27:48.830 --> 02:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
so um let's let's try to adhere to that
 
02:27:50.750 --> 02:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
um if you have a conflict of interest on
 
02:27:54.349 --> 02:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
some particular bill uh let me know and
 
02:27:56.570 --> 02:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
and if you feel you can't vote for some
 
02:27:59.090 --> 02:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
reason on a bill but the thing is
 
02:28:01.490 --> 02:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
there's no abstention in a subcommittee
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
it's either up or it's down
 
02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
and when you're when I'm calling the
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
vote and in that the clerk will then say
 
02:28:13.370 --> 02:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
here's the motion read off the title so
 
02:28:15.770 --> 02:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
we know what you're voting on even if
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's amended we've got to have the
 
02:28:18.969 --> 02:28:18.979 align:start position:0%
amendment number as well
 
02:28:21.889 --> 02:28:21.899 align:start position:0%
the response should be yes you're for it
 
02:28:24.410 --> 02:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
or no or yay or nay
 
02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to have a lot of
 
02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
dialogue attached to a well it's an a
 
02:28:32.030 --> 02:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
with a lot of thought and a concern I
 
02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to hear it it's either up or
 
02:28:33.720 --> 02:28:34.429 align:start position:0%

or let anybody else your ranking a
 
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
member the ranking member is
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative Miler here the vice
 
02:29:09.710 --> 02:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
chairs representative cordelli and the
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
clerk to be maybe is Oliver four
 
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
representative Oliver Ford here
 
02:29:18.650 --> 02:29:18.660 align:start position:0%
um he's come on with his dirty socks and
 
02:29:19.969 --> 02:29:19.979 align:start position:0%
all that and
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
that he referenced here
 
02:29:25.550 --> 02:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
um but no uh the clerk's job is a job
 
02:29:28.010 --> 02:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
which is an important job it's what's
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
you know recorded during these meetings
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
and you can have people come in and they
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
want to know what's going on they can
 
02:29:36.349 --> 02:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
ask to look at the record and those
 
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
notes are there the clerk does not jot
 
02:29:41.090 --> 02:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
down verbatim everything that's said
 
02:29:43.130 --> 02:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
they're looking primarily from upstairs
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
where they look at the stuff bullets
 
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
this was said this was said this was
 
02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
said you know and that's what Clark has
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
to do is record that but it's a very
 
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
important statutory position
 
02:29:56.510 --> 02:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh opening up the questions right now if
 
02:29:59.389 --> 02:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
anybody has questions representative uh
 
02:30:02.450 --> 02:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative blood I
 
02:30:03.770 --> 02:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
think it's important for the committee
 
02:30:04.809 --> 02:30:04.819 align:start position:0%
to note
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
that this is a policy committee
 
02:30:10.849 --> 02:30:10.859 align:start position:0%
we deal with policy
 
02:30:13.790 --> 02:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
and that's an important distinction here
 
02:30:16.190 --> 02:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
because we don't deal with Finance now
 
02:30:18.050 --> 02:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean we're not concerned
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
about the cost of a particular bill
 
02:30:23.090 --> 02:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
but if the bill comes before us that has
 
02:30:25.730 --> 02:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note to it it's ultimately
 
02:30:28.670 --> 02:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
going to go to the finance committee and
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
they make the final judgment so if they
 
02:30:34.610 --> 02:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
get a policy question from us that has a
 
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note to it they'll then say well
 
02:30:39.050 --> 02:30:39.060 align:start position:0%
you know we like the policy but we just
 
02:30:40.670 --> 02:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
can't pay for it
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important for this
 
02:30:44.929 --> 02:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
committee to look at the policy question
 
02:30:48.590 --> 02:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
here what is the intent of a particular
 
02:30:48.600 --> 02:30:49.429 align:start position:0%
here what is the intent of a particular
bill

02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's always in my mind's eye the first
 
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to ask is what's the
 
02:30:56.270 --> 02:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
intent because sometimes you'll get a
 
02:30:59.630 --> 02:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
bill that's that's very detailed but you
 
02:31:03.290 --> 02:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
lose what is its purpose because to me
 
02:31:05.809 --> 02:31:05.819 align:start position:0%
it well if I know the intent it then
 
02:31:07.730 --> 02:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
gives me the screen that I need to look
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
at the bill through uh so I think that's
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
an important important point to me I
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
thought that's technology
 
02:31:17.570 --> 02:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
we have bills that come before us but
 
02:31:19.730 --> 02:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
then they may go to another Kim I've had
 
02:31:21.290 --> 02:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
times when a bill has gone to three
 
02:31:21.300 --> 02:31:22.610 align:start position:0%
times when a bill has gone to three
committees

02:31:22.610 --> 02:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
committees
 
02:31:24.830 --> 02:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
it can go for example from here to
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
Judiciary from Judiciary into Ways and
 
02:31:32.030 --> 02:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
Means or into Finance uh so that that
 
02:31:36.370 --> 02:31:36.380 align:start position:0%
will occur there it's hard to really
 
02:31:39.050 --> 02:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
devoid yourself of looking at Finance
 
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
for example today we were talking about
 
02:31:42.349 --> 02:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid one of those
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
components there special education
 
02:31:47.389 --> 02:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
the issue that I have boiling in my head
 
02:31:48.830 --> 02:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
all the time is
 
02:31:52.130 --> 02:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
it some children have a special need
 
02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
needing attendant attending to all day
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
long with Specialists others may be
 
02:32:03.710 --> 02:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
there for two half hours a week maybe
 
02:32:06.889 --> 02:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
it's a an articulation problem in the
 
02:32:08.570 --> 02:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
younger grade and then with a bunch of
 
02:32:09.950 --> 02:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
other kindergarten kids or first grade
 
02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:10.849 align:start position:0%
other kindergarten kids or first grade
kids

02:32:10.849 --> 02:32:10.859 align:start position:0%
kids
 
02:32:13.610 --> 02:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
it costs a whole lot more to educate
 
02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
that child that's getting 24 7 type
 
02:32:19.010 --> 02:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
special education we do have
 
02:32:21.170 --> 02:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
catastrophic our special education Aid
 
02:32:24.170 --> 02:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
now that cuts in but that cuts in way
 
02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
after the district spent a whole load of
 
02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:27.530 align:start position:0%
after the district spent a whole load of
money

02:32:27.530 --> 02:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:32:31.070 --> 02:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
and so do we need to wait
 
02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
those categories or wait something so
 
02:32:36.349 --> 02:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
that there's some like many other states
 
02:32:38.809 --> 02:32:38.819 align:start position:0%
I so that's a policy that blends in with
 
02:32:38.819 --> 02:32:40.010 align:start position:0%
I so that's a policy that blends in with
Finance

02:32:40.010 --> 02:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
02:32:42.530 --> 02:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
so so yes I agree with what
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative Meyer said the the
 
02:32:48.530 --> 02:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
finance is finance and we are policy but
 
02:32:52.010 --> 02:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
policy and Finance on Fast learned you
 
02:32:54.650 --> 02:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
can't always forget it you know you're
 
02:32:56.690 --> 02:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
devoid it we've had a number of meetings
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
where we've been invited Finance in here
 
02:33:02.929 --> 02:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
and been a part of a hearing process
 
02:33:06.410 --> 02:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
uh that's not uncommon that's very
 
02:33:09.290 --> 02:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
commonly done so good point
 
02:33:11.389 --> 02:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
representative Miler representative you
 
02:33:13.309 --> 02:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
had your hand up also yeah thanks thanks
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair all right just a
 
02:33:17.090 --> 02:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
quick question are we going to have
 
02:33:20.809 --> 02:33:20.819 align:start position:0%
exclusive um use of this room yes we are
 
02:33:22.490 --> 02:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
going to have exclusive use of this room
 
02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
we are the only committee that has been
 
02:33:27.469 --> 02:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
assigned one double room for the entire
 
02:33:31.070 --> 02:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
year that that is absolutely needed when
 
02:33:33.650 --> 02:33:33.660 align:start position:0%
we're talking last year we had 139 bills
 
02:33:36.469 --> 02:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
in that one year and this year it's
 
02:33:38.330 --> 02:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
quite possible where might break that
 
02:33:40.490 --> 02:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
record we could break that record right
 
02:33:42.410 --> 02:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
I tried the other day on the house floor
 
02:33:44.330 --> 02:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
to get one vacated and we did get a
 
02:33:46.370 --> 02:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
vacated one bill
 
02:33:49.730 --> 02:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I mentioned to the speaker
 
02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to vacate 100 of them and so so
 
02:33:56.330 --> 02:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
so in addition to the drawers for
 
02:33:59.690 --> 02:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
storing things we can leave from night
 
02:34:01.490 --> 02:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
to night like you know if they're not if
 
02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be dust cleaning if
 
02:34:04.670 --> 02:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
we can leave some material yeah the only
 
02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
question would be the desk cleaner
 
02:34:08.389 --> 02:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
because with with uh covet and
 
02:34:10.250 --> 02:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
everything else there's been a need just
 
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
like you do in the schools for
 
02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:13.910 align:start position:0%
like you do in the schools for
superintendent

02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
02:34:16.130 --> 02:34:16.140 align:start position:0%
um you have to do a cleaning job and so
 
02:34:18.830 --> 02:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
but we'll be told that day when they do
 
02:34:20.570 --> 02:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
that and vacuuming is another thing
 
02:34:22.490 --> 02:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
which they're trying to get around we do
 
02:34:25.250 --> 02:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
have the file cabinets out there and we
 
02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
used to have all the files for this
 
02:34:31.309 --> 02:34:31.319 align:start position:0%
committee filed in that room we now have
 
02:34:34.190 --> 02:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
a Legislative Assistant
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
um well Jennifer Forrest here she's our
 
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
researcher and she's always here and Jen
 
02:34:45.410 --> 02:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
Jen is fabulous Jen came in I first met
 
02:34:47.690 --> 02:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
her when she came in from Hawaii
 
02:34:50.450 --> 02:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
and she's an attorney and she worked
 
02:34:52.370 --> 02:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
with special ed services over at doe
 
02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:53.210 align:start position:0%
with special ed services over at doe
White

02:34:53.210 --> 02:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
White
 
02:34:56.690 --> 02:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
and and now she's here and she's just
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
really upgraded our support and given us
 
02:35:04.849 --> 02:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of ability to research and but
 
02:35:06.830 --> 02:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
she's not the person responsible for
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
doing our scheduling
 
02:35:11.389 --> 02:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
that's Lindsay and Lindsay is going to
 
02:35:15.650 --> 02:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
be his house down the hallway and she we
 
02:35:16.670 --> 02:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
used to have our Legislative Assistant
 
02:35:19.250 --> 02:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
right in this room in here but because
 
02:35:21.770 --> 02:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
we have the double rooms now we've
 
02:35:23.690 --> 02:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
pushed those people down the hallway a
 
02:35:25.730 --> 02:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
little bit that's where our scheduling
 
02:35:27.410 --> 02:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
is done
 
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
um so all the files are kept down the
 
02:35:31.610 --> 02:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
hallway as well
 
02:35:33.830 --> 02:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
so you have a file drawer in there which
 
02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
is identify with your name you can leave
 
02:35:37.730 --> 02:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
the the some of the materials that I
 
02:35:39.410 --> 02:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
always like to have I always like this
 
02:35:40.730 --> 02:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
one I know this is representative
 
02:35:42.290 --> 02:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
Tanner's thing
 
02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
um to get copies of this book and I I
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
concur with her I think we all need a
 
02:35:50.450 --> 02:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
copy but I'm a lot like uh
 
02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton back there who has all
 
02:35:58.429 --> 02:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
these slips marking 193 194 CD whatever
 
02:36:02.210 --> 02:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
it might be I got it right there and
 
02:36:04.730 --> 02:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
um so it's I always have at my desk here
 
02:36:06.349 --> 02:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to leave it there so I
 
02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
put in the drawer out there
 
02:36:09.889 --> 02:36:09.899 align:start position:0%
it's hard to carry this thing back and
 
02:36:12.889 --> 02:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
forth from the home uh I also will try
 
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
to get everybody a copy of ed306 so
 
02:36:17.630 --> 02:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
those the the rules for minimum
 
02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval
 
02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
they are just as important to be looking
 
02:36:24.410 --> 02:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
at that as it is the statutes we've
 
02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
given doe the State Board I mean
 
02:36:30.710 --> 02:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
authority to write rules in support of
 
02:36:35.929 --> 02:36:35.939 align:start position:0%
the laws which we pass and and so those
 
02:36:38.330 --> 02:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
rules are really important to look at
 
02:36:40.370 --> 02:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
and become familiar with even though
 
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
there's efforts on the sidelines
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere where they're trying to
 
02:36:47.809 --> 02:36:47.819 align:start position:0%
rewrite ed306 we're looking at three
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
academic standards and minimum standards
 
02:36:52.370 --> 02:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
for public school approval we have a
 
02:36:53.809 --> 02:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee starting
 
02:36:58.130 --> 02:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
up next Tuesday at Tuesday on that one
 
02:37:00.650 --> 02:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
um see where we are in that I I really
 
02:37:02.330 --> 02:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
don't know where we are on that I'm
 
02:37:03.889 --> 02:37:03.899 align:start position:0%
trying to get a better handle on it
 
02:37:06.410 --> 02:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
academic standards are the key to it all
 
02:37:08.809 --> 02:37:08.819 align:start position:0%
and the minimum Public School standards
 
02:37:11.929 --> 02:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
are equally as important so we'll we'll
 
02:37:13.550 --> 02:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
go there then
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
um any other questions
 
02:37:17.389 --> 02:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
or information that's needed yes
 
02:37:19.610 --> 02:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chair I think you make
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
an important point that people might not
 
02:37:26.410 --> 02:37:26.420 align:start position:0%
be aware of that when a bill is passed
 
02:37:29.809 --> 02:37:29.819 align:start position:0%
rules are then made to implement that
 
02:37:31.070 --> 02:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
that law
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what Rick is referring
 
02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
to it that's very important in the 306th
 
02:37:40.910 --> 02:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
comes up for review every 10 years yeah
 
02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
every 10 years and so we're in that
 
02:37:44.929 --> 02:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
phase right now where these rules are
 
02:37:47.210 --> 02:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
being looked at by the department and
 
02:37:48.770 --> 02:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
they've been working on it for about two
 
02:37:52.010 --> 02:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
years now and it's coming coming to the
 
02:37:54.770 --> 02:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
end of that review where you get a lot
 
02:37:56.570 --> 02:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
more public input for it too but the
 
02:37:58.490 --> 02:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
rules are important because it basically
 
02:38:01.370 --> 02:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
takes the intent of the bill and says
 
02:38:04.929 --> 02:38:04.939 align:start position:0%
how is it going to be applied
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
academic standards cannot be adopted by
 
02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
the state board
 
02:38:12.889 --> 02:38:12.899 align:start position:0%
without approval from us
 
02:38:16.910 --> 02:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
so that we put into law last year has
 
02:38:18.530 --> 02:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
come before the legislative oversight
 
02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee also if you look at 193 under
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
the adequacy every 10 rules our academic
 
02:38:26.809 --> 02:38:26.819 align:start position:0%
standards which are adopted after a
 
02:38:29.210 --> 02:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
certain date require General Court
 
02:38:29.220 --> 02:38:30.349 align:start position:0%
certain date require General Court
approval

02:38:30.349 --> 02:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
approval
 
02:38:32.570 --> 02:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative are representative
 
02:38:45.349 --> 02:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:45.359 --> 02:38:48.770 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:38:48.770 --> 02:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:52.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:38:52.090 --> 02:38:52.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:55.550 --> 02:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
right uh my name is
 
02:38:57.050 --> 02:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney with the Department of
 
02:38:59.570 --> 02:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
Education it's very nice to be here in
 
02:39:00.889 --> 02:39:00.899 align:start position:0%
front of all of you I just want to
 
02:39:02.510 --> 02:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that rule making process
 
02:39:04.670 --> 02:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative Miler said when a law is
 
02:39:06.889 --> 02:39:06.899 align:start position:0%
passed in there are rules there are only
 
02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
rules created when the law says rule
 
02:39:13.370 --> 02:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
making authority pursuant to RSA 541a
 
02:39:15.530 --> 02:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
and what we have found is from time to
 
02:39:18.889 --> 02:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
time there are areas where it says where
 
02:39:20.630 --> 02:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
it has that rule making Authority but it
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
really mimics what the law already says
 
02:39:25.550 --> 02:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
it was a law passed last session about
 
02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:26.630 align:start position:0%
it was a law passed last session about
um

02:39:26.630 --> 02:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:29.450 --> 02:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
water fountains or water water bottle
 
02:39:31.849 --> 02:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
stations in in schools but it was
 
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
already laid out in the law and there
 
02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
was really no need for the rules it
 
02:39:36.530 --> 02:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
would be redundant
 
02:39:39.889 --> 02:39:39.899 align:start position:0%
um the opposite of that is when a law is
 
02:39:39.899 --> 02:39:40.910 align:start position:0%
um the opposite of that is when a law is
passed

02:39:40.910 --> 02:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:39:42.889 --> 02:39:42.899 align:start position:0%
and there is no rule-making Authority
 
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
but it talks about guidance or
 
02:39:49.309 --> 02:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines and and there needs to be
 
02:39:51.410 --> 02:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
things that are fleshed out
 
02:39:53.090 --> 02:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
and so it's important to take that into
 
02:39:54.770 --> 02:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
consideration when you look at these
 
02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
laws that are coming before you the
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
department cannot just go into rule
 
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
making it needs that authority to do so
 
02:40:04.670 --> 02:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
and the rule making really needs to be
 
02:40:07.010 --> 02:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
enumerated as to what this legislative
 
02:40:10.130 --> 02:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
body wants those rules to entail
 
02:40:12.050 --> 02:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions or talk
 
02:40:13.790 --> 02:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
about that rulemaking process but those
 
02:40:15.230 --> 02:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
are some of the things we've seen at the
 
02:40:16.849 --> 02:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
department when we are putting the laws
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
into practice
 
02:40:22.670 --> 02:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
there are times when we we use this 541a
 
02:40:24.349 --> 02:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
and we
 
02:40:27.650 --> 02:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
we refer back to a whole section of our
 
02:40:30.469 --> 02:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
chapter of law which is wrong we have to
 
02:40:33.410 --> 02:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
reference back to specific areas that
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for making these
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
rules I can remember when we passed the
 
02:40:40.969 --> 02:40:40.979 align:start position:0%
legislation for the fourth year of
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
mathematics in high school it's embedded
 
02:40:45.889 --> 02:40:45.899 align:start position:0%
it's not a requirement for graduation
 
02:40:48.650 --> 02:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
The Way It Was Written in statute there
 
02:40:51.230 --> 02:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
was no need for rules they just took
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
what was in the statute and that became
 
02:40:59.030 --> 02:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
how you do things and so yeah we we well
 
02:41:00.950 --> 02:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
we want to stop the rule making process
 
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
if we can it's it's I don't know if we
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
want to stop it I'll not stop it we're
 
02:41:07.309 --> 02:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
getting on overload though we want to be
 
02:41:08.990 --> 02:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
mindful of how we utilize it and I think
 
02:41:10.730 --> 02:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
a great example of the rulemaking
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
process is representative Lads bill that
 
02:41:17.090 --> 02:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
was passed a few sessions ago as it
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
pertains to the code of conduct in the
 
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
code of ethics which you're probably
 
02:41:22.670 --> 02:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
very familiar with
 
02:41:25.330 --> 02:41:25.340 align:start position:0%
um if you look at 21
 
02:41:29.690 --> 02:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
N9 subsection S I believe it said code
 
02:41:32.030 --> 02:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
of conduct which would have four
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
principles in an IT enumerated the four
 
02:41:36.650 --> 02:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
principles but then it deferred to rule
 
02:41:38.450 --> 02:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
making to flush out those four
 
02:41:40.910 --> 02:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
principles and the department can
 
02:41:43.550 --> 02:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
provide this legislative body with the
 
02:41:45.770 --> 02:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
code of conduct but it is very detailed
 
02:41:47.690 --> 02:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a great example of
 
02:41:49.490 --> 02:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking process if you think of
 
02:41:52.429 --> 02:41:52.439 align:start position:0%
the statute as the foundation of the
 
02:41:54.530 --> 02:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
house the frame of the house the roof of
 
02:41:57.170 --> 02:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
the house and then the rule making are
 
02:41:58.610 --> 02:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
the interior
 
02:42:02.510 --> 02:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
design right the couches the drapes the
 
02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
things like that it flushes out the
 
02:42:06.410 --> 02:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
process and I think the code of conduct
 
02:42:09.050 --> 02:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
is a great example of that thank you
 
02:42:11.809 --> 02:42:11.819 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for Diana Fenton
 
02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
Shield she'll be around she's
 
02:42:16.250 --> 02:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
she's here and
 
02:42:19.010 --> 02:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
um she's very very helpful she's a prior
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutor so don't mess around with her
 
02:42:24.650 --> 02:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
yeah don't hold that against me thank
 
02:42:26.210 --> 02:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much I appreciate
 
02:42:29.090 --> 02:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
your time so lastly the other thing that
 
02:42:32.090 --> 02:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
some people ask me about amendments
 
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
we will get a lot of bills our job here
 
02:42:38.570 --> 02:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
is to pass good bills if we think we can
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
make it a better Bill we should try to
 
02:42:41.870 --> 02:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:42:43.370 --> 02:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
but if it's going to take an
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
extraordinary amount of work
 
02:42:48.170 --> 02:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
and and we know that a subcommittee is
 
02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to do it it's not
 
02:42:52.670 --> 02:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
worth trying to you know
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
Hammer something into it and make it
 
02:42:56.030 --> 02:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
work because we'll probably end up
 
02:42:58.809 --> 02:42:58.819 align:start position:0%
making it worse and and
 
02:43:01.849 --> 02:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
enacting legislation which then requires
 
02:43:03.650 --> 02:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
a lot it not requires results and
 
02:43:07.130 --> 02:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
confusion out there in the schools so we
 
02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
can make amendments we do make
 
02:43:10.730 --> 02:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
amendments I encourage people to do that
 
02:43:13.849 --> 02:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
if somebody hands you an amendment say I
 
02:43:16.429 --> 02:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
want you to handle that as a Committee
 
02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
Member you can introduce an amendment
 
02:43:21.290 --> 02:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
but the individual out in the crowd
 
02:43:23.270 --> 02:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
cannot introduce a limit to this
 
02:43:25.309 --> 02:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
committee it has to be presented to us
 
02:43:28.429 --> 02:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
by a member on this committee
 
02:43:30.650 --> 02:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
so and you can get the Amendments made
 
02:43:33.770 --> 02:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh across the street where legislative
 
02:43:36.530 --> 02:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
Services is still and they can have that
 
02:43:38.870 --> 02:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
emailed over to a committee Services
 
02:43:41.210 --> 02:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
upstairs and they make copies that's
 
02:43:43.250 --> 02:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
Jennifer does that and brings those
 
02:43:44.950 --> 02:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
amendments down here
 
02:43:47.809 --> 02:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
if you are looking at amendments try
 
02:43:50.210 --> 02:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
work with your ranking uh you know a
 
02:43:52.969 --> 02:43:52.979 align:start position:0%
person or the or the vice chair myself
 
02:43:55.490 --> 02:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
so that we will know that's coming at us
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
and so we can you know handle it
 
02:43:58.080 --> 02:43:59.270 align:start position:0%
and so we can you know handle it
properly

02:43:59.270 --> 02:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
properly
 
02:44:01.790 --> 02:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
reps and lockers
 
02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah a question concerning amendments if
 
02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:06.410 align:start position:0%
yeah a question concerning amendments if
we

02:44:06.410 --> 02:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:44:09.170 --> 02:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
um let's say we put in a bill or
 
02:44:11.150 --> 02:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored a bill or whatever and then
 
02:44:13.309 --> 02:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
later realize that it really wasn't
 
02:44:17.270 --> 02:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
right that maybe referenced a different
 
02:44:19.490 --> 02:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
section than we intended or whatever and
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
we don't realize it in time
 
02:44:25.490 --> 02:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
if we get that Amendment written up very
 
02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:27.110 align:start position:0%
if we get that Amendment written up very
early

02:44:27.110 --> 02:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
early
 
02:44:29.809 --> 02:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
can we introduce it
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
at the uh you know when when the bill is
 
02:44:34.610 --> 02:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
actually introduced if we've put it out
 
02:44:36.050 --> 02:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
and let everybody know here's the
 
02:44:38.929 --> 02:44:38.939 align:start position:0%
amendment this is really what we wanted
 
02:44:42.170 --> 02:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
it to say can we do that or what is the
 
02:44:43.250 --> 02:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
there are a number of bills which are
 
02:44:45.530 --> 02:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
going to come at us which are still lsrs
 
02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
legislative service requests
 
02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:49.490 align:start position:0%
legislative service requests
and

02:44:49.490 --> 02:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:44:53.210 --> 02:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
if you encountered the the the new folks
 
02:44:55.490 --> 02:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
over in uh office legislative Services
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
right now all the people drafting bills
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
a good part of them are new and all the
 
02:45:05.210 --> 02:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
folks in the office as you walk in aside
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
from one are new and so they're jumping
 
02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
through some hoops which are new for
 
02:45:13.389 --> 02:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
them and so we're getting uh
 
02:45:16.190 --> 02:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
lsrs handed back to us from OLS
 
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes the day before you have to
 
02:45:20.750 --> 02:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
have all your sponsors on and every time
 
02:45:22.910 --> 02:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
you have you make a modification it's a
 
02:45:25.309 --> 02:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
different version to that bill
 
02:45:28.130 --> 02:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
that will require them to send that out
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
and get approval of all the co-sponsors
 
02:45:33.309 --> 02:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
even though the co-sponsors initially
 
02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
approved the original version if you
 
02:45:39.230 --> 02:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
change a version all that other stuff's
 
02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
thrown out because they're having you're
 
02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
having to approve now the new version
 
02:45:45.410 --> 02:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
which may be very different
 
02:45:48.410 --> 02:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
so uh we're going to see bills coming in
 
02:45:50.510 --> 02:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
now this year I know there's several
 
02:45:53.330 --> 02:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
that I've had that are not out yet that
 
02:45:56.510 --> 02:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
gone by the date and and you may only
 
02:45:59.090 --> 02:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
have one or two people as the signing
 
02:46:01.309 --> 02:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
off on that bill that I have time to do
 
02:46:02.690 --> 02:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean just because there's
 
02:46:04.969 --> 02:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
only one person the bill is not doesn't
 
02:46:07.130 --> 02:46:07.140 align:start position:0%
have any Merit it means it's probably
 
02:46:09.530 --> 02:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
gone through some stuff over there where
 
02:46:11.690 --> 02:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
it's just come out late and we couldn't
 
02:46:13.550 --> 02:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
get all the names on that and that's
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
going to be frequent so now when you
 
02:46:18.230 --> 02:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
bring that forward you may see here's an
 
02:46:21.950 --> 02:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to that bill I I to improve it
 
02:46:24.170 --> 02:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
you can win your testifying presenting
 
02:46:27.050 --> 02:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
it you can also say I have an amendment
 
02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
here I will present it with my testimony
 
02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
here and we as a committee can look at
 
02:46:35.690 --> 02:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
that it may may help so that's a good
 
02:46:38.450 --> 02:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
point representative
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
anything else okay right now we have my
 
02:46:43.429 --> 02:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
cell phone doesn't work when I come to
 
02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
Concord I don't know why Verizon
 
02:46:48.490 --> 02:46:48.500 align:start position:0%
um what time is it
 
02:46:50.929 --> 02:46:50.939 align:start position:0%
okay let's break right now and come back
 
02:46:52.309 --> 02:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock
 
02:46:54.469 --> 02:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
and at that time we're going to have
 
02:46:56.570 --> 02:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
higher education in here for that hour
 
02:46:59.690 --> 02:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
half hour for our University system the
 
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
other for the community college system
 
02:47:03.770 --> 02:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
we work very closely with those folks
 
02:47:06.290 --> 02:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
all their policy issues have to come
 
02:47:09.349 --> 02:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
before this committee and where we've
 
02:47:11.870 --> 02:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
been merging programs over there and
 
02:47:13.610 --> 02:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
courses that are taught in the community
 
02:47:15.290 --> 02:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
college and the leading up to it that's
 
02:47:17.150 --> 02:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
we we do that here that has to be
 
02:47:18.590 --> 02:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
approved through this it's all stat
 
02:47:21.050 --> 02:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
story so it's important that we hear
 
02:47:22.790 --> 02:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
from thank you very much I've enjoyed
 
02:47:25.010 --> 02:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
working with you this morning learning a
 
02:47:27.050 --> 02:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of good expertise here it
 
02:47:30.050 --> 02:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
should be a great year thanks
 
02:47:32.590 --> 02:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just seeing her away
 
03:35:01.269 --> 03:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.250 --> 03:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
I like to get uh going here on the
 
03:35:05.809 --> 03:35:05.819 align:start position:0%
second part of today's orientation
 
03:35:08.690 --> 03:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
meeting as I mentioned earlier
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
um this afternoon we had the higher
 
03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
education and then we have School Board
 
03:35:13.849 --> 03:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
Association School administrators
 
03:35:17.050 --> 03:35:17.060 align:start position:0%
Association and the Nea and aft
 
03:35:20.389 --> 03:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
we do have both parties here higher
 
03:35:22.729 --> 03:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
education University system and you're
 
03:35:25.030 --> 03:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
not even sitting together
 
03:35:27.290 --> 03:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
what happened to that merger we were
 
03:35:29.510 --> 03:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to have
 
03:35:29.520 --> 03:35:30.530 align:start position:0%
supposed to have
okay

03:35:30.530 --> 03:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:35:32.330 --> 03:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
um just another one other thing I was
 
03:35:33.710 --> 03:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
asked by several people during the break
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
is it okay to have water or fluids here
 
03:35:36.239 --> 03:35:37.610 align:start position:0%
is it okay to have water or fluids here
yes

03:35:37.610 --> 03:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:35:39.410 --> 03:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
you know we've been told by all the
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
medical doctors keep drinking as much as
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
you can in here so if you want to bring
 
03:35:46.010 --> 03:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
water and I you don't have to put in the
 
03:35:47.750 --> 03:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
floor we tried that trick once before
 
03:35:49.610 --> 03:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
and everybody was kicking the cans over
 
03:35:51.469 --> 03:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
and then we got nailed because the
 
03:35:53.750 --> 03:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
stains on the floor so if you have a
 
03:35:55.910 --> 03:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
beverage you want to drink just make
 
03:36:01.929 --> 03:36:01.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:05.650 --> 03:36:05.660 align:start position:0%
don't look at me like that
 
03:36:08.570 --> 03:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
accessible yes yeah that's fine that's
 
03:36:10.849 --> 03:36:10.859 align:start position:0%

no we'll give you we're starting a
 
03:37:03.950 --> 03:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
little late so you get another five
 
03:37:06.349 --> 03:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
minutes Kathy used to be the treasurer
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
of the state as well right and does
 
03:37:10.130 --> 03:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
everyone have the deck that we
 
03:37:11.510 --> 03:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
distributed in front of them you have
 
03:37:14.090 --> 03:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
access to that okay so I'm going to page
 
03:37:16.130 --> 03:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
two of the deck and we'll go back and
 
03:37:19.130 --> 03:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
forth a bit as we make the our comments
 
03:37:23.090 --> 03:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
this afternoon so the uh page two of the
 
03:37:25.010 --> 03:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
deck is is really the biggest and big
 
03:37:26.990 --> 03:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
picture about who we are and who we
 
03:37:29.389 --> 03:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
represent so as you can see there's the
 
03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
statutory language at the top that talks
 
03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
about this establishment of the
 
03:37:35.630 --> 03:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire to
 
03:37:37.490 --> 03:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
provide a well-coordinated system of
 
03:37:39.590 --> 03:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
public higher education serve the needs
 
03:37:41.630 --> 03:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
of the state in the nation also research
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
which contributes to the welfare of
 
03:37:45.349 --> 03:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
mankind and also bringing educational
 
03:37:47.690 --> 03:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
resources and professional experience to
 
03:37:49.130 --> 03:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the state and its people
 
03:37:51.130 --> 03:37:51.140 align:start position:0%
so we have a pretty broad mandate
 
03:37:54.110 --> 03:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
associated with education from the
 
03:37:57.469 --> 03:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
statute we've given you sort of a mini
 
03:37:59.510 --> 03:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
organizational chart there on the lower
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
left hand side and so the system the
 
03:38:04.370 --> 03:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
university university system excuse me
 
03:38:06.830 --> 03:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is just below the state
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and then we have the
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
three major institutions that are part
 
03:38:14.870 --> 03:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
of of the University system and then a
 
03:38:17.870 --> 03:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
few details below that we also have as
 
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
it says on the lower right hand side a
 
03:38:22.250 --> 03:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees and we've given you in
 
03:38:24.530 --> 03:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
the italicized section there some idea
 
03:38:26.150 --> 03:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
where the various members of the Board
 
03:38:28.729 --> 03:38:28.739 align:start position:0%
of Trustees come from and then another
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
part of our leadership is the
 
03:38:31.790 --> 03:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
president's Council which is the
 
03:38:34.490 --> 03:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
president of the three institutions
 
03:38:37.190 --> 03:38:37.200 align:start position:0%

03:39:12.410 --> 03:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
um for those of who have been on the
 
03:39:14.269 --> 03:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
education committee for quite some time
 
03:39:16.670 --> 03:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
some of this
 
03:39:16.680 --> 03:39:17.330 align:start position:0%
some of this
um

03:39:17.330 --> 03:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
is information you already are aware of
 
03:39:22.429 --> 03:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
but understanding there are a number of
 
03:39:24.290 --> 03:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
new members we want to really cover at a
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
high level information about the
 
03:39:31.190 --> 03:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:33.170 --> 03:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
um you know part of our statutory
 
03:39:35.269 --> 03:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
mandate is to
 
03:39:36.889 --> 03:39:36.899 align:start position:0%
um work toward and ensure a
 
03:39:39.050 --> 03:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
well-coordinated system
 
03:39:42.650 --> 03:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
and we have been recognized for our
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
strong financial management by Moody's
 
03:39:49.250 --> 03:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
credit rating agency in um in late
 
03:39:49.260 --> 03:39:51.110 align:start position:0%
credit rating agency in um in late
November

03:39:51.110 --> 03:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
November
 
03:39:53.870 --> 03:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
um the entire higher education industry
 
03:39:56.650 --> 03:39:56.660 align:start position:0%
is on negative watch
 
03:39:58.610 --> 03:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
Moody's just put the industry on
 
03:40:00.650 --> 03:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
negative watch and we were notified that
 
03:40:02.690 --> 03:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
our Outlook was upgraded from negative
 
03:40:06.290 --> 03:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
to stable in November and
 
03:40:08.889 --> 03:40:08.899 align:start position:0%
um that's in large part because of the
 
03:40:12.830 --> 03:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
really hard intensive work we've been
 
03:40:15.769 --> 03:40:15.779 align:start position:0%
doing over the past three years to
 
03:40:18.070 --> 03:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
streamline our administrative structure
 
03:40:21.889 --> 03:40:21.899 align:start position:0%
rethink how the work is done and
 
03:40:24.290 --> 03:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
um through doing so have reduced our
 
03:40:26.210 --> 03:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
overall cost structure by about 50
 
03:40:29.150 --> 03:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars between fiscal 19 and
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
22. you'll hear a little bit more this
 
03:40:33.769 --> 03:40:33.779 align:start position:0%
afternoon about why that is absolutely
 
03:40:37.070 --> 03:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
necessary for the University system
 
03:40:38.809 --> 03:40:38.819 align:start position:0%
um with the challenges that higher
 
03:40:41.570 --> 03:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
education in New England is facing over
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
the next decade so with that I'm going
 
03:40:45.469 --> 03:40:45.479 align:start position:0%
to turn it back over to Jim to talk
 
03:40:46.849 --> 03:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
about mission
 
03:40:46.859 --> 03:40:47.750 align:start position:0%
about mission
foreign

03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:40:50.510 --> 03:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Kathy so on on page four
 
03:40:53.090 --> 03:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
we talk about uh the workforce needs of
 
03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
the state and together with our
 
03:40:57.349 --> 03:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
colleagues from the community colleges
 
03:40:59.510 --> 03:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
we do an awful lot to prepare people to
 
03:41:01.490 --> 03:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
be part of the workforce I know that
 
03:41:04.010 --> 03:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
Workforce is a huge concern for the
 
03:41:05.750 --> 03:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
state and for all the businesses within
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
it so we just wanted to give you a
 
03:41:09.050 --> 03:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
couple of Statistics there that we
 
03:41:10.610 --> 03:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
thought might be helpful
 
03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
so just within the graduating classes of
 
03:41:17.170 --> 03:41:17.180 align:start position:0%
of eight years from 2012 to 2020
 
03:41:19.849 --> 03:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
1800 graduates of the University system
 
03:41:22.130 --> 03:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
are working in the state as part of the
 
03:41:24.469 --> 03:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
workforce obviously there's many more
 
03:41:25.729 --> 03:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
than that if you go back through other
 
03:41:27.229 --> 03:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
years but we wanted to just give you
 
03:41:28.969 --> 03:41:28.979 align:start position:0%
sort of a sense of you know even
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
recently how many people are joining the
 
03:41:32.450 --> 03:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
workforce in New Hampshire who are
 
03:41:35.210 --> 03:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
graduates from the various institutions
 
03:41:37.670 --> 03:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
that are that are part of the system
 
03:41:40.010 --> 03:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
we don't do this in a vacuum and so we
 
03:41:42.170 --> 03:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
collaborate in a lot of ways with the
 
03:41:45.469 --> 03:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
businesses in the uh in the state and so
 
03:41:46.910 --> 03:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
you can see the other number that we put
 
03:41:48.889 --> 03:41:48.899 align:start position:0%
there is that we have over 2 000
 
03:41:51.290 --> 03:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
partners of businesses in the state with
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
whom we work closely actually we have a
 
03:41:55.729 --> 03:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
number of councils and various other
 
03:41:58.429 --> 03:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
kinds of relationships uh to stay close
 
03:42:01.309 --> 03:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
to the workforce needs of the state I
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
have a business advisory Council that
 
03:42:05.510 --> 03:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
advises me as president of the
 
03:42:07.250 --> 03:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire of a number
 
03:42:09.410 --> 03:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
of businesses from around the state and
 
03:42:12.469 --> 03:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
I've also joined about two years ago the
 
03:42:14.450 --> 03:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
Executive Board of the business and
 
03:42:16.429 --> 03:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
industry Association so we do an awful
 
03:42:18.590 --> 03:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
lot to stay close to the needs of the
 
03:42:20.030 --> 03:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state and we see
 
03:42:22.250 --> 03:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
ourselves a really important part of our
 
03:42:24.729 --> 03:42:24.739 align:start position:0%
mission as being to try and provide
 
03:42:26.929 --> 03:42:26.939 align:start position:0%
qualified people to help the business
 
03:42:28.550 --> 03:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
community in New Hampshire to achieve
 
03:42:29.750 --> 03:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
their goals
 
03:42:31.610 --> 03:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
I'm going to apologize to those of you
 
03:42:33.050 --> 03:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
who are behind this speaker here I'll
 
03:42:36.590 --> 03:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
try to move around a little bit on page
 
03:42:38.750 --> 03:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
five we talked just a little bit about
 
03:42:41.870 --> 03:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
the research Mission uh of the system
 
03:42:44.570 --> 03:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
um much of it is at UNH because UNH is
 
03:42:46.670 --> 03:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
is a the research University in the
 
03:42:48.830 --> 03:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
system but other research is done at all
 
03:42:52.070 --> 03:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the institutions so UNH is indeed
 
03:42:54.469 --> 03:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
what's known as a Carnegie one or the
 
03:42:56.330 --> 03:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
first highest level of research
 
03:42:58.429 --> 03:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
University in the country a leading
 
03:43:00.889 --> 03:43:00.899 align:start position:0%
research institution bringing as it says
 
03:43:03.290 --> 03:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
over 260 million dollars in competitive
 
03:43:05.210 --> 03:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
research funding to New Hampshire in
 
03:43:08.570 --> 03:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
2021 so that funding comes into the
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
university and it supports people who
 
03:43:14.269 --> 03:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
are doing that research it supports
 
03:43:16.150 --> 03:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
things that we have to buy equipment
 
03:43:19.550 --> 03:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
telescopes boats literally ships all
 
03:43:22.130 --> 03:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
kinds of things but we also then employ
 
03:43:23.809 --> 03:43:23.819 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who support that
 
03:43:25.969 --> 03:43:25.979 align:start position:0%
research so the research that comes in
 
03:43:28.150 --> 03:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
and all of this research is coming in
 
03:43:30.170 --> 03:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
competitively from the federal
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
government including the National
 
03:43:35.290 --> 03:43:35.300 align:start position:0%
Science Foundation NOAA National
 
03:43:38.510 --> 03:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
Institutes of Health and so on benefits
 
03:43:39.889 --> 03:43:39.899 align:start position:0%
the economy in New Hampshire so it's
 
03:43:42.050 --> 03:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
really important that we talk about that
 
03:43:43.490 --> 03:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
that is an important part of what the
 
03:43:48.110 --> 03:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:50.570 --> 03:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
we also as it says through the epscor
 
03:43:53.510 --> 03:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
program build research capacity through
 
03:43:55.250 --> 03:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
educational institutions across the
 
03:43:57.469 --> 03:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
state investments in infrastructure the
 
03:43:59.570 --> 03:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
workforce and early stage academic
 
03:44:01.729 --> 03:44:01.739 align:start position:0%
research this is a huge Enterprise
 
03:44:04.370 --> 03:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
within the university system
 
03:44:06.530 --> 03:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
um far too big to really do justice too
 
03:44:08.750 --> 03:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the time that we have available but
 
03:44:10.250 --> 03:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
we certainly stand ready to give
 
03:44:12.229 --> 03:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
additional information if that would be
 
03:44:12.239 --> 03:44:14.929 align:start position:0%
additional information if that would be
helpful

03:44:14.929 --> 03:44:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:18.290 --> 03:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
moving then to Page Six
 
03:44:20.090 --> 03:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
we talk a little bit about Student
 
03:44:23.210 --> 03:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
Success and Student Success is a bit of
 
03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
a complicated uh point or a complicated
 
03:44:29.389 --> 03:44:29.399 align:start position:0%
construct but one of the elements of
 
03:44:31.130 --> 03:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
Student Success that's really important
 
03:44:34.190 --> 03:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
is the graduation rate and the people
 
03:44:36.830 --> 03:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
who monitor graduation rate
 
03:44:39.110 --> 03:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
um through the iPad system which is in
 
03:44:42.530 --> 03:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
the footnotes here I've decided that
 
03:44:44.809 --> 03:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
they use it for a six years graduation
 
03:44:46.190 --> 03:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
rate as opposed to a four-year
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
graduation rate many students across the
 
03:44:49.969 --> 03:44:49.979 align:start position:0%
country take longer than four years to
 
03:44:51.769 --> 03:44:51.779 align:start position:0%
graduate so they take they use six years
 
03:44:53.690 --> 03:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
as The Benchmark that's their decision
 
03:44:57.410 --> 03:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
not ours as you can see the institutions
 
03:44:59.630 --> 03:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
in the University system do rather well
 
03:45:01.849 --> 03:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
against that Benchmark so you see the
 
03:45:03.469 --> 03:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
other states in New England made Rhode
 
03:45:05.570 --> 03:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
Island Massachusetts Connecticut Vermont
 
03:45:08.570 --> 03:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
and our graduation rate is higher than
 
03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
any of those which is something that
 
03:45:12.170 --> 03:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
we're really proud of so one of the
 
03:45:13.630 --> 03:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
things that you've probably read about
 
03:45:17.809 --> 03:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
is is the challenges with student debt
 
03:45:19.610 --> 03:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
students who take out loans and we'll
 
03:45:21.889 --> 03:45:21.899 align:start position:0%
talk about that just in one second but
 
03:45:24.410 --> 03:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
really the worst case for a student is
 
03:45:26.929 --> 03:45:26.939 align:start position:0%
to borrow money for his or her education
 
03:45:29.450 --> 03:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
and then not graduate because then
 
03:45:30.889 --> 03:45:30.899 align:start position:0%
they're not able to get the kind of job
 
03:45:32.950 --> 03:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
that allows them to pay that debt back
 
03:45:35.809 --> 03:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
and the higher your graduation rate is
 
03:45:37.250 --> 03:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
then the better off you are from that
 
03:45:39.170 --> 03:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
standpoint so we're really proud of that
 
03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
having said that we believe that could
 
03:45:43.190 --> 03:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
be higher in all of the institutions
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
have programs in place in order to
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
continue to make that graduation rate uh
 
03:45:51.410 --> 03:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
met graduation rate higher on the right
 
03:45:53.090 --> 03:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
side you have the student loan default
 
03:45:54.769 --> 03:45:54.779 align:start position:0%
rate and that's also something that
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're very proud of again looking at
 
03:45:59.630 --> 03:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
various competitors our student loan
 
03:46:01.790 --> 03:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
default rate which is a measure of
 
03:46:03.650 --> 03:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
students literally not being able to pay
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
back their loans is quite a bit lower
 
03:46:08.510 --> 03:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
than the U.S average the public average
 
03:46:10.849 --> 03:46:10.859 align:start position:0%
the Northeast average and so what that
 
03:46:13.250 --> 03:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
means is that the preparation that we're
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
providing for students in the system is
 
03:46:17.210 --> 03:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
such that it allows them to go out and
 
03:46:18.830 --> 03:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
get jobs which allow them to pay back
 
03:46:20.450 --> 03:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
their loans and again that's something
 
03:46:25.250 --> 03:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:29.389 --> 03:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
moving then to page seven
 
03:46:31.490 --> 03:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
I think this is a really important point
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
that we've had five years in which we
 
03:46:36.769 --> 03:46:36.779 align:start position:0%
have not increased tuition for students
 
03:46:38.690 --> 03:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
coming from New Hampshire and there
 
03:46:40.250 --> 03:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
aren't very many universities in the
 
03:46:42.830 --> 03:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
country that could make that claim
 
03:46:42.840 --> 03:46:43.729 align:start position:0%
country that could make that claim
um

03:46:43.729 --> 03:46:43.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:45.950 --> 03:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
this is at a time as you know we're
 
03:46:47.929 --> 03:46:47.939 align:start position:0%
we're in an inflationary environment
 
03:46:49.969 --> 03:46:49.979 align:start position:0%
especially the last couple of years and
 
03:46:52.190 --> 03:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
so when we are keeping tuition flat it's
 
03:46:54.050 --> 03:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
in real dollars it's effectively
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:00.830 --> 03:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
I also want to point out as it says in
 
03:47:04.070 --> 03:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
the bold face below the chart that the
 
03:47:06.110 --> 03:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
granite guarantee covers full tuition
 
03:47:07.370 --> 03:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire students with
 
03:47:09.530 --> 03:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
exceptional need which means that those
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
students who are qualified for Pell
 
03:47:14.690 --> 03:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
Grants grants to those students who come
 
03:47:16.849 --> 03:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
from families with limited resources
 
03:47:18.650 --> 03:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
that those students actually pay no
 
03:47:22.010 --> 03:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
tuition now I need a hasten to say that
 
03:47:23.330 --> 03:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that college is free for
 
03:47:25.610 --> 03:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
them because there's residence halls and
 
03:47:26.990 --> 03:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
there's food and there's books and
 
03:47:28.670 --> 03:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
things like that but this is a
 
03:47:29.929 --> 03:47:29.939 align:start position:0%
commitment that we made a number of
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
years ago that our poor students would
 
03:47:34.729 --> 03:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
not have to pay any tuition and that
 
03:47:36.290 --> 03:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
makes a tremendous difference for them
 
03:47:37.910 --> 03:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
they're being able to complete that's
 
03:47:41.570 --> 03:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
probably partly responsible for their
 
03:47:43.190 --> 03:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
completion rate and also their ability
 
03:47:45.290 --> 03:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
to pay to pay back any loans that they
 
03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
might have taken
 
03:47:49.070 --> 03:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
so flat tuition for five years and
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
increasing financial aid so the real
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
cost to students has actually gone down
 
03:47:55.550 --> 03:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
over the past few years for the
 
03:47:57.830 --> 03:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
institutions in our system
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then finally before I turn it back
 
03:48:01.729 --> 03:48:01.739 align:start position:0%
to Kathy on page eight I'll talk about
 
03:48:03.769 --> 03:48:03.779 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension and what we're
 
03:48:05.929 --> 03:48:05.939 align:start position:0%
doing to bring other resources into the
 
03:48:07.670 --> 03:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
state we're really proud of our
 
03:48:09.650 --> 03:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension program as you may
 
03:48:12.410 --> 03:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
know UNH is a land-grant institution
 
03:48:13.849 --> 03:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
which means that we'll have Cooperative
 
03:48:15.530 --> 03:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
Extension we have people out around the
 
03:48:17.389 --> 03:48:17.399 align:start position:0%
state doing the kind of traditional
 
03:48:18.889 --> 03:48:18.899 align:start position:0%
things you would expect of Cooperative
 
03:48:21.769 --> 03:48:21.779 align:start position:0%
Extension I just visited within apple
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
orchard a couple of months ago where we
 
03:48:25.309 --> 03:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
had one of our scientists out there
 
03:48:27.229 --> 03:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
helping the people who run the apple
 
03:48:29.210 --> 03:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
orchard to figure out how to grow
 
03:48:32.150 --> 03:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
peaches in New Hampshire so if you
 
03:48:33.410 --> 03:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
thought you grow peaches in New
 
03:48:34.610 --> 03:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire raise your hand because I sure
 
03:48:36.410 --> 03:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
didn't I thought that was a losing
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
proposition but science has a way and so
 
03:48:40.670 --> 03:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
apparently we are now growing peaches in
 
03:48:41.870 --> 03:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I had one it wasn't
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
bad actually so so that's the really
 
03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
kind of traditional thing we do but we
 
03:48:47.389 --> 03:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
do a lot of other things that are much
 
03:48:49.790 --> 03:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
less traditional around Workforce we've
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
worked a lot with various communities
 
03:48:52.910 --> 03:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire to help them do
 
03:48:54.830 --> 03:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
Economic Development to bring tourism
 
03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
and economic sustainability
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh the Small Business Development Center
 
03:49:00.950 --> 03:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
does a lot of work that's where big
 
03:49:02.690 --> 03:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
businesses come from is is small
 
03:49:04.429 --> 03:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
businesses and an awful lot of
 
03:49:05.929 --> 03:49:05.939 align:start position:0%
professional development just helping
 
03:49:08.030 --> 03:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
people to learn the skills that they
 
03:49:10.490 --> 03:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
need to run whether it be a business or
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
whether it be a not-for-profit or to
 
03:49:14.030 --> 03:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
participate in the economy and in some
 
03:49:16.729 --> 03:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
other ways so this whole Cooperative
 
03:49:18.650 --> 03:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
Extension area and the associate areas
 
03:49:21.650 --> 03:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
that are not the Core teaching
 
03:49:23.450 --> 03:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
undergraduates or even graduate students
 
03:49:25.250 --> 03:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make sure we highlighted
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
that because I think they're really
 
03:49:28.910 --> 03:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
important to the well-being of the state
 
03:49:31.190 --> 03:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
and with that Kathy I'll turn it back to
 
03:49:35.330 --> 03:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
you great thanks Jim so so Jim shared
 
03:49:36.849 --> 03:49:36.859 align:start position:0%
with you all the good news
 
03:49:39.530 --> 03:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
and and I'm going to share with you some
 
03:49:41.570 --> 03:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
of the challenging news
 
03:49:46.910 --> 03:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
so um You probably seen on the news read
 
03:49:48.650 --> 03:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
in the paper
 
03:49:50.870 --> 03:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
um higher education especially in New
 
03:49:50.880 --> 03:49:51.769 align:start position:0%
um higher education especially in New
England

03:49:51.769 --> 03:49:51.779 align:start position:0%
England
 
03:49:55.070 --> 03:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
is facing some pretty serious headwinds
 
03:49:58.490 --> 03:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
as a primarily as a result of
 
03:50:02.030 --> 03:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
demographic shifts you know from um well
 
03:50:03.290 --> 03:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
maybe you haven't had that part of your
 
03:50:05.450 --> 03:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
orientation yet but you know that the
 
03:50:08.150 --> 03:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
K-12 population is on the decline
 
03:50:11.870 --> 03:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
and that is a pipeline for those that
 
03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
will attend a
 
03:50:17.090 --> 03:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
institutions of Higher Learning and then
 
03:50:19.370 --> 03:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
be part of our Workforce so the
 
03:50:22.190 --> 03:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
demographic challenges are not solely in
 
03:50:24.050 --> 03:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they're in the entire
 
03:50:27.530 --> 03:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
region which is causing incredible
 
03:50:27.540 --> 03:50:29.750 align:start position:0%
region which is causing incredible
competition

03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
competition
 
03:50:32.290 --> 03:50:32.300 align:start position:0%
amongst the New England and New York now
 
03:50:37.309 --> 03:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
States for college-going students to
 
03:50:37.319 --> 03:50:38.090 align:start position:0%
States for college-going students to
support

03:50:38.090 --> 03:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:50:41.690 --> 03:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
their Workforce all of that means that
 
03:50:44.210 --> 03:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
enrollment is on the decline we have
 
03:50:46.429 --> 03:50:46.439 align:start position:0%
been preparing for it for quite some
 
03:50:48.710 --> 03:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
time that's why I talked earlier about
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
what do we need to do to decrease our
 
03:50:53.090 --> 03:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
cost structure when we don't have as
 
03:50:55.309 --> 03:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
many students and as much tuition in
 
03:50:57.769 --> 03:50:57.779 align:start position:0%
tuition dollars we need to think about
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
how our cost structure is set up so
 
03:51:04.309 --> 03:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
changing demographics intense
 
03:51:06.530 --> 03:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
competition and we have low State
 
03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
support in relation to our peers around
 
03:51:12.170 --> 03:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
New England and around the country we
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:18.170 --> 03:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
well geez if I would have flipped
 
03:51:20.030 --> 03:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
forward I could have told you there's
 
03:51:23.570 --> 03:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
your there's your K-12 slide no I I knew
 
03:51:25.130 --> 03:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
it was there
 
03:51:29.450 --> 03:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
um but again this is this this has a
 
03:51:32.510 --> 03:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
direct impact on the number of college
 
03:51:32.520 --> 03:51:33.769 align:start position:0%
direct impact on the number of college
goers

03:51:33.769 --> 03:51:33.779 align:start position:0%
goers
 
03:51:37.130 --> 03:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
and then the number of college educated
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
people who will enter our Workforce so
 
03:51:41.690 --> 03:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's all connected and then on
 
03:51:43.610 --> 03:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
slide 11 you can see that New Hampshire
 
03:51:46.490 --> 03:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
if you measure per capita or your
 
03:51:48.830 --> 03:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
measure per thousand dollars in income
 
03:51:51.769 --> 03:51:51.779 align:start position:0%
all the of all 50 states
 
03:51:54.229 --> 03:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that the is the 50th
 
03:51:59.030 --> 03:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
and that that directly correlates to the
 
03:52:00.769 --> 03:52:00.779 align:start position:0%
reason that we have high in-state
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
tuition in relation to other states
 
03:52:04.670 --> 03:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
around the country
 
03:52:06.969 --> 03:52:06.979 align:start position:0%
um the the state support
 
03:52:10.190 --> 03:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
buys down that in-state tuition when
 
03:52:14.510 --> 03:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
slide 12. these are examples of
 
03:52:21.590 --> 03:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
the intense competition
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
um Tom drove by he was in Rochester
 
03:52:25.670 --> 03:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
coming down the Spalding Turnpike and
 
03:52:28.910 --> 03:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
there were two Billboards one for human
 
03:52:31.910 --> 03:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
the University of Maine and one for was
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
it SUNY
 
03:52:37.910 --> 03:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
like uh perpendicular to one another
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
saying come to our institutions for the
 
03:52:44.450 --> 03:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
same price as your in-state tuition in
 
03:52:45.469 --> 03:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:52:47.870 --> 03:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
the sunnis the State University system
 
03:52:49.550 --> 03:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
in New York
 
03:52:51.889 --> 03:52:51.899 align:start position:0%
they have a full on
 
03:52:55.790 --> 03:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar campaign to blast the
 
03:52:59.710 --> 03:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
entire region in an effort to pull
 
03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
students from New England to the Sunni
 
03:53:08.210 --> 03:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
system and will offer go there for less
 
03:53:10.010 --> 03:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
than you'd pay at in-state tuition and
 
03:53:12.650 --> 03:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
UNH again the point is the competition
 
03:53:15.769 --> 03:53:15.779 align:start position:0%
is really intense
 
03:53:18.229 --> 03:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
and on slide 13
 
03:53:18.239 --> 03:53:19.309 align:start position:0%
and on slide 13
um

03:53:19.309 --> 03:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:22.370 --> 03:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
this is just a history of the state of I
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
know this is a the policy committee for
 
03:53:28.130 --> 03:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
education but I think it's important to
 
03:53:30.290 --> 03:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
um outline the state support for the
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
University system about eight percent of
 
03:53:36.410 --> 03:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
our total budget
 
03:53:38.330 --> 03:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
comes from state general fund
 
03:53:38.340 --> 03:53:39.610 align:start position:0%
comes from state general fund
Appropriations

03:53:39.610 --> 03:53:39.620 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
03:53:43.010 --> 03:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
and so our request for fiscal years 24
 
03:53:44.570 --> 03:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
and 25
 
03:53:50.630 --> 03:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
is to get back to where we were in 2011.
 
03:53:53.269 --> 03:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
and we have some targeted
 
03:53:56.150 --> 03:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
requests that we'll be making relative
 
03:53:56.160 --> 03:53:57.290 align:start position:0%
requests that we'll be making relative
to

03:53:57.290 --> 03:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:54:01.130 --> 03:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
um internship capacity and
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
um the the programs that PL at Keene and
 
03:54:06.349 --> 03:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
the programs at Plymouth where the
 
03:54:08.809 --> 03:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
students go out into the community work
 
03:54:10.429 --> 03:54:10.439 align:start position:0%
with the businesses work with the
 
03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
non-profits you may have seen it on the
 
03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
news that there were a group of students
 
03:54:14.809 --> 03:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
that were up in the North Country
 
03:54:17.210 --> 03:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
working on a project with the mill
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
property we really want to to bolster
 
03:54:25.370 --> 03:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
that work at Plymouth and Keene
 
03:54:27.889 --> 03:54:27.899 align:start position:0%
and with that there's contact
 
03:54:30.410 --> 03:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
information I also want to mention we
 
03:54:32.090 --> 03:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
did put a couple of slides in the
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
appendix relative to ongoing work from
 
03:54:38.210 --> 03:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
legislation in the last session that's
 
03:54:41.870 --> 03:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
the Granite State College merger
 
03:54:43.910 --> 03:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
um Granite State College is being merged
 
03:54:46.370 --> 03:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
into the University of New Hampshire as
 
03:54:50.210 --> 03:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
a as a college within the university and
 
03:54:53.570 --> 03:54:53.580 align:start position:0%
also HB 1530 representative Ford very
 
03:54:55.250 --> 03:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
familiar with that piece of legislation
 
03:54:58.370 --> 03:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
there's a slide of the ongoing work that
 
03:55:00.170 --> 03:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
the university system is doing with the
 
03:55:01.849 --> 03:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
community college system relative to
 
03:55:04.670 --> 03:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
transfer Pathways between those two
 
03:55:08.210 --> 03:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
systems and with that
 
03:55:10.370 --> 03:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer any questions that
 
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
you folks have of us thank you very much
 
03:55:14.689 --> 03:55:14.699 align:start position:0%
I'll open up with one question for your
 
03:55:18.050 --> 03:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
request for information uh I've often
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
heard that New Hampshire is an exporter
 
03:55:23.210 --> 03:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
of high school students to other states
 
03:55:25.729 --> 03:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
for college
 
03:55:28.910 --> 03:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
um where I've heard that 60 percent of
 
03:55:31.969 --> 03:55:31.979 align:start position:0%
our graduates go outside uh that's a
 
03:55:34.610 --> 03:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
rough percentage is there anything we're
 
03:55:37.250 --> 03:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
doing to try to reverse that Trend to
 
03:55:39.229 --> 03:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
keep these folks that are in high school
 
03:55:44.150 --> 03:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
well that Grant guarantee is one
 
03:55:50.809 --> 03:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
initiative if you will to try to to try
 
03:55:51.889 --> 03:55:51.899 align:start position:0%
to keep
 
03:55:51.899 --> 03:55:52.490 align:start position:0%
to keep
um

03:55:52.490 --> 03:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:54.889 --> 03:55:54.899 align:start position:0%
students here in New Hampshire
 
03:55:56.809 --> 03:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
um I know that
 
03:55:58.790 --> 03:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
um actually you may
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
sure so the granite guarantee is
 
03:56:03.229 --> 03:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
certainly one for our poor students uh
 
03:56:05.689 --> 03:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
also keeping our tuition flat for five
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
years in a row makes us more competitive
 
03:56:09.950 --> 03:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
for our students for in-state tuition
 
03:56:12.349 --> 03:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
flat and we also then have various
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship programs we have for example
 
03:56:16.969 --> 03:56:16.979 align:start position:0%
the Hamill Scholars Program which is
 
03:56:18.650 --> 03:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
available to the highest achieving
 
03:56:20.929 --> 03:56:20.939 align:start position:0%
students only from New Hampshire to try
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
and keep those students here the
 
03:56:26.330 --> 03:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
challenge is is because of the low State
 
03:56:28.790 --> 03:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
support our tuition is higher than we
 
03:56:30.530 --> 03:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
wish it were and that that leads
 
03:56:32.929 --> 03:56:32.939 align:start position:0%
students to leave
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the number of students who left the
 
03:56:36.530 --> 03:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
state dramatically increased when our
 
03:56:38.630 --> 03:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
funding was cut 10 years ago yeah I I
 
03:56:40.849 --> 03:56:40.859 align:start position:0%
know that up in Woodsville at Walmart
 
03:56:43.729 --> 03:56:43.739 align:start position:0%
there's a 18-wheeler up there
 
03:56:45.710 --> 03:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
Budweiser on one side and the other side
 
03:56:48.170 --> 03:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
said go black bears
 
03:56:51.349 --> 03:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
so that's how Humane is competing
 
03:56:54.469 --> 03:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
you know through that getting to the
 
03:56:58.010 --> 03:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
eyes right up there yep
 
03:57:01.010 --> 03:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
yes represent Belcher
 
03:57:04.250 --> 03:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I I just had a
 
03:57:05.929 --> 03:57:05.939 align:start position:0%
question on on as far as the state
 
03:57:07.670 --> 03:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
support issue and I'm certainly sure
 
03:57:09.110 --> 03:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
that it's true that you probably receive
 
03:57:10.790 --> 03:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
less compared to other New England
 
03:57:13.550 --> 03:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
regions I'm looking also if you have any
 
03:57:15.769 --> 03:57:15.779 align:start position:0%
information on other causes
 
03:57:17.630 --> 03:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
um as far as tuition being high for
 
03:57:19.729 --> 03:57:19.739 align:start position:0%
instance I didn't see any statistics in
 
03:57:22.910 --> 03:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
this handout about say
 
03:57:26.150 --> 03:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
um the ratios of uh professors to
 
03:57:28.130 --> 03:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
administrative Personnel now compared to
 
03:57:30.950 --> 03:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps 30 years ago and if that's
 
03:57:34.610 --> 03:57:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
sure we always do we always do look at
 
03:57:38.750 --> 03:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
those kind of things that we can get
 
03:57:40.070 --> 03:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
just some additional information about
 
03:57:42.650 --> 03:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
that I will say that across the board
 
03:57:44.630 --> 03:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
nationally those ratios have been
 
03:57:47.750 --> 03:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
changing in favor of Administrators just
 
03:57:51.130 --> 03:57:51.140 align:start position:0%
to give you one example so uh Title IX
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
Title IX as it's been reinterpreted
 
03:57:55.490 --> 03:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
first by the Obama Administration then
 
03:57:57.050 --> 03:57:57.060 align:start position:0%
the Trump Administration not the Biden
 
03:57:59.570 --> 03:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
Administration has cost each institution
 
03:58:01.610 --> 03:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars in
 
03:58:03.889 --> 03:58:03.899 align:start position:0%
staff support in order to comply with
 
03:58:07.130 --> 03:58:07.140 align:start position:0%
those kinds of uh basically unfunded
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
mandates is effectively what they are
 
03:58:11.389 --> 03:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
the other thing we're seeing is that
 
03:58:13.070 --> 03:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
student needs for things outside the
 
03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
classroom have dramatically increased uh
 
03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
you've probably read that there's a
 
03:58:18.229 --> 03:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis among college
 
03:58:19.929 --> 03:58:19.939 align:start position:0%
students so we have been in the position
 
03:58:22.490 --> 03:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
of pretty dramatically increasing the
 
03:58:24.170 --> 03:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
number of counselors that we provide to
 
03:58:25.910 --> 03:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
students over the last few years so
 
03:58:27.530 --> 03:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
those would be two examples of why some
 
03:58:30.849 --> 03:58:30.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:33.050 --> 03:58:33.060 align:start position:0%
represented I actually have some I
 
03:58:35.929 --> 03:58:35.939 align:start position:0%
actually have some numbers so
 
03:58:35.939 --> 03:58:38.150 align:start position:0%
actually have some numbers so
um

03:58:38.150 --> 03:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:40.429 --> 03:58:40.439 align:start position:0%
the university system spends about
 
03:58:42.650 --> 03:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
thirty one hundred dollars annually per
 
03:58:44.570 --> 03:58:44.580 align:start position:0%
student on day-to-day operational
 
03:58:44.580 --> 03:58:47.210 align:start position:0%
student on day-to-day operational
expenses

03:58:47.210 --> 03:58:47.220 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
03:58:49.010 --> 03:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
knowing other New England four-year
 
03:58:49.020 --> 03:58:49.870 align:start position:0%
knowing other New England four-year
Publix

03:58:49.870 --> 03:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
Publix
 
03:58:53.570 --> 03:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
41.50 so we have one of the lowest
 
03:58:57.050 --> 03:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
administrative costs per student
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
in New England and again this effort
 
03:59:05.389 --> 03:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
starting in 2019 to really drive down
 
03:59:08.090 --> 03:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
administrative costs even further
 
03:59:08.100 --> 03:59:10.929 align:start position:0%
administrative costs even further
through

03:59:10.929 --> 03:59:10.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:13.550 --> 03:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
leveraging scale in everything
 
03:59:16.130 --> 03:59:16.140 align:start position:0%
administrative that we could grab onto
 
03:59:18.410 --> 03:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
and that work does not stop we know we
 
03:59:20.750 --> 03:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
have to continue that work so it is a
 
03:59:23.689 --> 03:59:23.699 align:start position:0%
top of mind sorry to interrupt you
 
03:59:26.269 --> 03:59:26.279 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up yes just briefly
 
03:59:28.490 --> 03:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh just just one more
 
03:59:29.689 --> 03:59:29.699 align:start position:0%
number I'd be interested in to help me
 
03:59:31.729 --> 03:59:31.739 align:start position:0%
understand the needs better do you
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
happen to know the
 
03:59:35.570 --> 03:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
um the levels of the endowments of the
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
three colleges Universities at how where
 
03:59:40.849 --> 03:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
foreign yes we can absolutely get that
 
03:59:45.429 --> 03:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
for you I can tell you that
 
03:59:50.510 --> 03:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
unh's endowment is much healthier than
 
03:59:52.389 --> 03:59:52.399 align:start position:0%
keen and Plymouth
 
03:59:55.610 --> 03:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
UNH has been very successful in its
 
03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
fundraising efforts in recent years
 
03:59:58.680 --> 04:00:00.410 align:start position:0%
fundraising efforts in recent years
um

04:00:00.410 --> 04:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:03.830 --> 04:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
I as to I will get that for you
 
04:00:05.450 --> 04:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
and so let me just say it's a great
 
04:00:07.309 --> 04:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you for that uh the
 
04:00:09.769 --> 04:00:09.779 align:start position:0%
number one uh
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
Target of fundraising and then the
 
04:00:14.750 --> 04:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
number one area of the gifts that we get
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
is for student scholarships so the main
 
04:00:18.830 --> 04:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
focus of philanthropy is actually to
 
04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
hold down the expense for our students
 
04:00:22.910 --> 04:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative miler
 
04:00:25.010 --> 04:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:00:26.510 --> 04:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:00:29.990 --> 04:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
I have three questions primarily focused
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
on students
 
04:00:34.910 --> 04:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
one is how many are in your guaranteed
 
04:00:34.920 --> 04:00:36.050 align:start position:0%
one is how many are in your guaranteed
program

04:00:36.050 --> 04:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:00:38.090 --> 04:00:38.100 align:start position:0%
how many students are in the guaranteed
 
04:00:39.650 --> 04:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
program your credit guarantee yeah
 
04:00:43.010 --> 04:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
granted guarantee excuse me secondly is
 
04:00:45.370 --> 04:00:45.380 align:start position:0%
what is the strategy of the university
 
04:00:49.969 --> 04:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
in combating the onslaught from Maine
 
04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
and from New York as you what's your
 
04:00:55.370 --> 04:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
strategy to deal with that and finally
 
04:00:59.210 --> 04:00:59.220 align:start position:0%
what is the current in-state out of
 
04:01:03.530 --> 04:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
state to uh student population at the at
 
04:01:05.929 --> 04:01:05.939 align:start position:0%
UNH particularly
 
04:01:08.630 --> 04:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay let me take the third one first uh
 
04:01:10.849 --> 04:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
the last one the last figures I saw were
 
04:01:14.150 --> 04:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
about 52 out of state and about 48 in
 
04:01:16.610 --> 04:01:16.620 align:start position:0%
state at UNH it changes every year yeah
 
04:01:18.349 --> 04:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
04:01:21.170 --> 04:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
um since we've been holding tuition flat
 
04:01:23.510 --> 04:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire students but not for
 
04:01:25.849 --> 04:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
out-of-state students I expect that that
 
04:01:28.130 --> 04:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
will probably change a little bit uh
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
over a period of time I don't know the
 
04:01:33.710 --> 04:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
number of uh granted guarantee students
 
04:01:35.210 --> 04:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look that up so we'll look
 
04:01:37.849 --> 04:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
that up and get that back to you and I
 
04:01:40.790 --> 04:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
would say that in terms of combating uh
 
04:01:42.889 --> 04:01:42.899 align:start position:0%
the other states who are coming for us
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
trying to increase our funding so that
 
04:01:47.689 --> 04:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
we can hold down our tuition is really
 
04:01:49.250 --> 04:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
one of the main things because that's
 
04:01:50.750 --> 04:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
what that's what they're beating us up
 
04:01:53.150 --> 04:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
with are as they see it relatively High
 
04:01:56.269 --> 04:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition having said that we
 
04:01:58.429 --> 04:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
have recently made some investments in
 
04:02:01.729 --> 04:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
enhancing our marketing to students to
 
04:02:03.530 --> 04:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
try and combat that to try and help them
 
04:02:05.510 --> 04:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
understand what the value of an
 
04:02:07.790 --> 04:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
education is from you and UNH or from
 
04:02:10.429 --> 04:02:10.439 align:start position:0%
Keen or from Plymouth so we're trying to
 
04:02:11.929 --> 04:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
combat it from that standpoint as well
 
04:02:14.150 --> 04:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's both priced and quality and just a
 
04:02:15.889 --> 04:02:15.899 align:start position:0%
follow-up what is your student
 
04:02:19.250 --> 04:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
population in the system now as it's
 
04:02:22.849 --> 04:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:24.349 --> 04:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
you have that in the fact book there
 
04:02:24.359 --> 04:02:27.410 align:start position:0%
you have that in the fact book there
it's

04:02:27.410 --> 04:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:29.269 --> 04:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's all
 
04:02:31.130 --> 04:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned it's on the decline hang
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
on just one second so in the fall
 
04:02:39.950 --> 04:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
of 21. okay
 
04:02:45.530 --> 04:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
our total full-time equivalence 22 800.
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
and in 18 five years earlier
 
04:02:51.889 --> 04:02:51.899 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand five hundred
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:02:57.070 --> 04:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
now we've lost 50 000 kids K through 12
 
04:03:00.349 --> 04:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
since I first got on this Committee in
 
04:03:01.849 --> 04:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
04:03:04.010 --> 04:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of students perhaps in
 
04:03:05.689 --> 04:03:05.699 align:start position:0%
Woodcock did you have to
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um good afternoon
 
04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question welcome
 
04:03:11.389 --> 04:03:11.399 align:start position:0%
a couple questions that I'm not trying
 
04:03:13.490 --> 04:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
to be buzzing at you just the number of
 
04:03:13.500 --> 04:03:14.689 align:start position:0%
to be buzzing at you just the number of
questions

04:03:14.689 --> 04:03:14.699 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:03:18.110 --> 04:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
um on the 18 800 on the workforce that
 
04:03:19.490 --> 04:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
came back and stayed in hanfield the
 
04:03:21.290 --> 04:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
last 10-year period how many how many
 
04:03:26.450 --> 04:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:28.790 --> 04:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
and I I have the number to stay here but
 
04:03:30.050 --> 04:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
how many actually what was the big
 
04:03:32.330 --> 04:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
population you pulled out
 
04:03:34.490 --> 04:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
I I don't know representative we'll have
 
04:03:36.530 --> 04:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
to get back to you because we have a man
 
04:03:38.689 --> 04:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
do you have an annual like graduation
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
number over that time
 
04:03:42.830 --> 04:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
for class basically
 
04:03:44.809 --> 04:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
probably on the order about 4 000
 
04:03:47.650 --> 04:03:47.660 align:start position:0%
something like that across the system
 
04:03:49.250 --> 04:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:03:51.290 --> 04:03:51.300 align:start position:0%
I think it's probably less than four
 
04:03:53.870 --> 04:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
thousand okay and the second one if I
 
04:03:55.729 --> 04:03:55.739 align:start position:0%
made Mr Sheriff thank you
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
um on holding the uh tuitions flat to
 
04:04:00.530 --> 04:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
the 10 year period
 
04:04:03.229 --> 04:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
what has been the increase in in uh fees
 
04:04:08.389 --> 04:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:14.689 --> 04:04:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
um the fees generally increase in this
 
04:04:18.410 --> 04:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
sort of one to two percent range a year
 
04:04:19.729 --> 04:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
or something like that
 
04:04:21.469 --> 04:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
um those are pretty direct things like
 
04:04:24.590 --> 04:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of food in the dining halls and
 
04:04:26.030 --> 04:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
residence hall costs and things like
 
04:04:27.769 --> 04:04:27.779 align:start position:0%
that so they don't go up dramatically
 
04:04:30.530 --> 04:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
they go up a small amount and we have a
 
04:04:32.689 --> 04:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
really elaborate process of working with
 
04:04:36.469 --> 04:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
the students uh to get their uh
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
their agreement for the most cases
 
04:04:39.290 --> 04:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
they're just not always complete
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
agreement but for the most part the
 
04:04:42.410 --> 04:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
students understand that they want the
 
04:04:43.849 --> 04:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
students that they want the services
 
04:04:46.010 --> 04:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
excuse me that the fees represent so
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're generally positive about the
 
04:04:49.250 --> 04:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
season thank you thank you Mr chair
 
04:04:50.990 --> 04:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:04:53.210 --> 04:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
yes representative cardelli
 
04:04:55.849 --> 04:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh both for being
 
04:04:55.859 --> 04:04:56.990 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh both for being
here

04:04:56.990 --> 04:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:04:58.849 --> 04:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
um just to follow up on the discussion
 
04:05:01.969 --> 04:05:01.979 align:start position:0%
about student debt and also the six-year
 
04:05:04.849 --> 04:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
graduation rate it seems that in the
 
04:05:07.610 --> 04:05:07.620 align:start position:0%
past few decades the number of students
 
04:05:10.849 --> 04:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
who don't graduate in four years has
 
04:05:13.309 --> 04:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
increased maybe I'm mistaken on that but
 
04:05:15.410 --> 04:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
that's my impression do you have any
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the reasons for uh the
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
increased numbers of students or maybe
 
04:05:22.910 --> 04:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of students not graduating in
 
04:05:25.490 --> 04:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
well I can speak to the change but I'll
 
04:05:29.450 --> 04:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
give you some sense of maybe some of the
 
04:05:31.610 --> 04:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
reasons why they don't graduate I mean
 
04:05:32.809 --> 04:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
so first of all some of them don't
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
graduate ever they right right they they
 
04:05:38.210 --> 04:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
simply drop out some of them decide uh
 
04:05:40.910 --> 04:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
that I mean some of it's economic uh you
 
04:05:43.130 --> 04:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
know they they need to get a job and
 
04:05:44.689 --> 04:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
they decide they needed to get a job now
 
04:05:46.610 --> 04:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
there's some adverse set back in their
 
04:05:48.050 --> 04:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
families and they need to support their
 
04:05:50.750 --> 04:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
families there's certainly some of that
 
04:05:53.570 --> 04:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
um for some of them they transfer to
 
04:05:56.510 --> 04:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
other institutions and that then they
 
04:05:58.849 --> 04:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
take a little longer to finish based on
 
04:05:58.859 --> 04:06:00.410 align:start position:0%
take a little longer to finish based on
that

04:06:00.410 --> 04:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:06:00.420 --> 04:06:01.130 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:06:01.130 --> 04:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:03.170 --> 04:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
for many of them it's it's events that
 
04:06:05.450 --> 04:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
happen in their lives that take them
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
away that the death of a parent for
 
04:06:09.530 --> 04:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
example a significant illness of a
 
04:06:11.090 --> 04:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
parent something like that and then
 
04:06:12.769 --> 04:06:12.779 align:start position:0%
there are some certainly who just don't
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
feel they can complete the academic work
 
04:06:16.969 --> 04:06:16.979 align:start position:0%
or it's decided for them that you know
 
04:06:18.889 --> 04:06:18.899 align:start position:0%
their their academic performance is poor
 
04:06:21.050 --> 04:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
enough that they don't uh they're not
 
04:06:22.610 --> 04:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
able to finish or not able to finish on
 
04:06:25.370 --> 04:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
time we also have students who change
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
majors and if you change Majors once you
 
04:06:30.889 --> 04:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
can probably make it work in four years
 
04:06:32.570 --> 04:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
if you change twice you probably can't
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
so there's some of that as well
 
04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and and finally some students really
 
04:06:41.590 --> 04:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
enjoy being in college
 
04:06:44.210 --> 04:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
and they they think five years is more
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
fun than four years we try to discourage
 
04:06:49.250 --> 04:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
that in fact we've just made an
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
investment in this actually goes back to
 
04:06:52.490 --> 04:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
your question representative Belcher
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
we've just made an investment in some
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
advisors to try and do a better job of
 
04:06:59.330 --> 04:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
helping the students to finish on time
 
04:07:00.590 --> 04:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
because it's a really important thing
 
04:07:01.969 --> 04:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
for us because we want to limit their
 
04:07:01.979 --> 04:07:03.349 align:start position:0%
for us because we want to limit their
debt

04:07:03.349 --> 04:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
debt
 
04:07:05.210 --> 04:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
thank you and one last question right
 
04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
here that I have
 
04:07:06.840 --> 04:07:07.670 align:start position:0%
here that I have
um

04:07:07.670 --> 04:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
in looking at granted guarantee that
 
04:07:11.809 --> 04:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
money has to come from somewhere to
 
04:07:14.150 --> 04:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
support that program you're trying to
 
04:07:17.210 --> 04:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
keep in-state tuition level
 
04:07:19.969 --> 04:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
and you also have Capital costs which
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
are hitting you
 
04:07:21.840 --> 04:07:22.610 align:start position:0%
are hitting you
um

04:07:22.610 --> 04:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:25.750 --> 04:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
not a very Rosy picture in terms of
 
04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents I understand it and
 
04:07:31.010 --> 04:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
we're also seeing that with uh jumping a
 
04:07:33.170 --> 04:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
little bit with the teacher shortage
 
04:07:35.450 --> 04:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
we're seeing many of our teachers coming
 
04:07:37.490 --> 04:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
out that are math science special ed
 
04:07:39.950 --> 04:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
going outside our state not remaining in
 
04:07:43.610 --> 04:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
our state so things aren't Rosy here uh
 
04:07:46.490 --> 04:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
from the money side uh
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
I know you're going to say well just
 
04:07:50.090 --> 04:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
state fund us more
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
um but do you have any significant
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
Capital needs that are coming up on top
 
04:07:57.769 --> 04:07:57.779 align:start position:0%
of uh what we've discussed here in terms
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
of uh costs for a student and granted
 
04:08:02.450 --> 04:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
guarantee what are the capital things
 
04:08:04.570 --> 04:08:04.580 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
04:08:09.650 --> 04:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
like the PSU Keen UNH absolutely there
 
04:08:11.689 --> 04:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
there are always significant Capital
 
04:08:14.630 --> 04:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
needs we we're operating three little
 
04:08:14.640 --> 04:08:16.550 align:start position:0%
needs we we're operating three little
cities

04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
cities
 
04:08:18.769 --> 04:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
um however we are in the process of
 
04:08:21.229 --> 04:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
evaluating our space needs as the number
 
04:08:23.870 --> 04:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
of students decline
 
04:08:26.389 --> 04:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
we have to think about the space that we
 
04:08:28.490 --> 04:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
have we also have to think about does
 
04:08:31.870 --> 04:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
the space we have meet the needs of the
 
04:08:35.330 --> 04:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
students we have and the research we do
 
04:08:37.610 --> 04:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
and the um
 
04:08:39.290 --> 04:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
the things that are being taught today
 
04:08:43.490 --> 04:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
right so yes there we we have the
 
04:08:46.969 --> 04:08:46.979 align:start position:0%
university system funds about 60 60 to
 
04:08:49.490 --> 04:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
65 million dollars a year in a capital
 
04:08:49.500 --> 04:08:50.929 align:start position:0%
65 million dollars a year in a capital
program

04:08:50.929 --> 04:08:50.939 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:08:50.939 --> 04:08:52.370 align:start position:0%
program
the

04:08:52.370 --> 04:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:56.090 --> 04:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:59.650 --> 04:08:59.660 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming biennium
 
04:09:03.010 --> 04:09:03.020 align:start position:0%
the state did a three biennium capital
 
04:09:05.450 --> 04:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
program for us
 
04:09:07.849 --> 04:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
to buy anything about this year the
 
04:09:10.010 --> 04:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
state this biennium coming up the state
 
04:09:12.550 --> 04:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
will fund 17 million dollars
 
04:09:15.710 --> 04:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
in costs primarily for our biological
 
04:09:17.570 --> 04:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
sciences initiative
 
04:09:19.849 --> 04:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
largest prod Capital project ever
 
04:09:22.130 --> 04:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
undertaken in the University system a 95
 
04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
million dollar project to eliminate a
 
04:09:26.689 --> 04:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
lot of deferred maintenance and expand
 
04:09:30.309 --> 04:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
the life sciences
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and buildings at the
 
04:09:34.070 --> 04:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
University so that at the University of
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so that we can keep up
 
04:09:38.929 --> 04:09:38.939 align:start position:0%
with with our our peers and what the
 
04:09:41.090 --> 04:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
world today expects out of
 
04:09:43.910 --> 04:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
Life Sciences so yes there are lots of
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
capital needs and we try to address them
 
04:09:50.809 --> 04:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
the best we can prioritize as best we
 
04:09:50.819 --> 04:09:52.189 align:start position:0%
the best we can prioritize as best we
can

04:09:52.189 --> 04:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:09:53.870 --> 04:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:09:56.330 --> 04:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
one last question represent Woodcock and
 
04:09:56.340 --> 04:09:57.170 align:start position:0%
one last question represent Woodcock and
then

04:09:57.170 --> 04:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:09:58.490 --> 04:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you this will be my last question
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:10:03.110 --> 04:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
um approximately how many uh the best
 
04:10:04.389 --> 04:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
gifts you can
 
04:10:07.309 --> 04:10:07.319 align:start position:0%
students coming in as freshman students
 
04:10:10.130 --> 04:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
particularly are taking remedial four
 
04:10:13.610 --> 04:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:15.889 --> 04:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
um we don't we don't there's none
 
04:10:18.050 --> 04:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
correct yeah so there's no remedial
 
04:10:21.889 --> 04:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
classes being offered for amen thank you
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
yeah we've had that answered like that
 
04:10:26.630 --> 04:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
in the past thank you thank you very
 
04:10:27.889 --> 04:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
much we're going to get on with the
 
04:10:29.809 --> 04:10:29.819 align:start position:0%
community college system appreciate you
 
04:10:31.130 --> 04:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
taking the time out of the day to come
 
04:10:33.650 --> 04:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
down president Dean and Kathy provincher
 
04:10:37.010 --> 04:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you always always glad to answer
 
04:10:48.950 --> 04:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
for those who don't know uh Mark
 
04:10:54.110 --> 04:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
Rubinstein is the chancellor of the
 
04:10:55.870 --> 04:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
community college system New Hampshire
 
04:10:59.689 --> 04:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
he was our past president of Granite
 
04:11:02.090 --> 04:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
State College and started that wonderful
 
04:11:04.010 --> 04:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
online program that they have and then
 
04:11:06.410 --> 04:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
they moved over and he's now with a
 
04:11:08.990 --> 04:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
two-year system and welcome Mark we
 
04:11:10.849 --> 04:11:10.859 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ladd first to
 
04:11:12.889 --> 04:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
correct the record I can't take credit
 
04:11:15.889 --> 04:11:15.899 align:start position:0%
for having started that program but did
 
04:11:18.590 --> 04:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
serve that college for seven years and I
 
04:11:20.269 --> 04:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to do that
 
04:11:23.150 --> 04:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
just for uh Clarity there should be
 
04:11:25.250 --> 04:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
presentation materials in front of you
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
that will look like this and I'm with uh
 
04:11:31.610 --> 04:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
thanks to my colleague and director Reid
 
04:11:34.130 --> 04:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
who helped prepare that and uh colleague
 
04:11:36.110 --> 04:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
director Doran who's also with me for
 
04:11:38.210 --> 04:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
college access programs I'm going to
 
04:11:40.429 --> 04:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
probably go a little bit off script you
 
04:11:43.309 --> 04:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
put together a presentation like this in
 
04:11:45.170 --> 04:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
the quiet of your office thinking you
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
know how you want to script The
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
Narrative and then you have the
 
04:11:50.630 --> 04:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity listen to questions from the
 
04:11:52.490 --> 04:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
panel and realize that maybe the
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
interests are a little bit different so
 
04:11:56.929 --> 04:11:56.939 align:start position:0%
I will make some reference to materials
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
here but more this is background
 
04:12:01.969 --> 04:12:01.979 align:start position:0%
information for you community college
 
04:12:05.090 --> 04:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
system has a Statewide Mission seven
 
04:12:08.150 --> 04:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
colleges embedded in regions throughout
 
04:12:10.849 --> 04:12:10.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and really intended to
 
04:12:13.849 --> 04:12:13.859 align:start position:0%
provide access visibility but as much as
 
04:12:16.490 --> 04:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
that excuse me as much as that is to
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
understand the needs of individual
 
04:12:19.849 --> 04:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
communities to understand what's
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
different about each of them and also
 
04:12:23.929 --> 04:12:23.939 align:start position:0%
what's the same so that we can provide
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
resources that are appropriate
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
the students who we serve are in many
 
04:12:31.370 --> 04:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
ways different from those that are
 
04:12:33.110 --> 04:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
typically served at a four-year
 
04:12:33.120 --> 04:12:34.450 align:start position:0%
typically served at a four-year
Institution

04:12:34.450 --> 04:12:34.460 align:start position:0%
Institution
 
04:12:37.309 --> 04:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
only about 22 percent of our students
 
04:12:40.370 --> 04:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
are 20 to 16 to 20 year old and this is
 
04:12:42.290 --> 04:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
outside of our dual enrollment the high
 
04:12:43.670 --> 04:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
school programs which I'll talk about in
 
04:12:45.950 --> 04:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
a minute 40 of our enrollment are
 
04:12:48.130 --> 04:12:48.140 align:start position:0%
students who are 25 and older and
 
04:12:50.990 --> 04:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
typically working adults often parents
 
04:12:52.429 --> 04:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
and you're going to see through the
 
04:12:53.870 --> 04:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
materials as you look through some
 
04:12:55.729 --> 04:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
vignettes some illustrations these are
 
04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
folks who live in your community are
 
04:12:59.630 --> 04:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
currently working and more likely than
 
04:13:01.550 --> 04:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
not three quarters of our students are
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
part-time almost all of them working
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
taking care of parents or children or
 
04:13:08.689 --> 04:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
other community responsibilities so
 
04:13:10.910 --> 04:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
their opportunities are often different
 
04:13:13.849 --> 04:13:13.859 align:start position:0%
than for students who who move directly
 
04:13:15.290 --> 04:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
from high school to four-year
 
04:13:15.300 --> 04:13:17.510 align:start position:0%
from high school to four-year
institutions

04:13:17.510 --> 04:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
the ways in which we serve these
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
students a significant number are in
 
04:13:23.929 --> 04:13:23.939 align:start position:0%
degree programs again primarily
 
04:13:26.450 --> 04:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
part-time but but in degree programs
 
04:13:27.950 --> 04:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
that are fairly traditional in the way
 
04:13:29.809 --> 04:13:29.819 align:start position:0%
you would think about them in classroom
 
04:13:32.570 --> 04:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
settings in clinical settings although
 
04:13:33.950 --> 04:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
currently about a third of our
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment is actually occurring online
 
04:13:38.689 --> 04:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
and gives us a more of a Statewide reach
 
04:13:41.090 --> 04:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
and with a rollout of broadband across
 
04:13:42.889 --> 04:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we should be able to
 
04:13:46.610 --> 04:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
amplify that we offer Workforce
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
Development programs short-term
 
04:13:50.809 --> 04:13:50.819 align:start position:0%
credentialing programs that are relevant
 
04:13:53.210 --> 04:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
to industries that help people make a
 
04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
quick start into careers maybe one of
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
the most significant ways in which we
 
04:13:59.689 --> 04:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
impact students in New Hampshire is
 
04:14:01.490 --> 04:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
through our dual enrollment programs
 
04:14:04.490 --> 04:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
about 8 000 students in a typical year
 
04:14:06.830 --> 04:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
will be served you'll be familiar with
 
04:14:09.710 --> 04:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
this perhaps through running start
 
04:14:11.450 --> 04:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
um the way that I think about this
 
04:14:14.150 --> 04:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
program for a student and within support
 
04:14:15.889 --> 04:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
of the legislature some students pay
 
04:14:17.330 --> 04:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
nothing for those credits that's
 
04:14:19.490 --> 04:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
absorbed by a scholarship other students
 
04:14:22.490 --> 04:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
pay fifty dollars a credit but in the
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
course of a typical year we estimate
 
04:14:26.450 --> 04:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
that we're saving New Hampshire students
 
04:14:28.130 --> 04:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
and families about seven and a half
 
04:14:30.349 --> 04:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars in higher education
 
04:14:32.570 --> 04:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
costs loans that they don't have to take
 
04:14:34.990 --> 04:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
out that they don't have to worry about
 
04:14:38.330 --> 04:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
and you'll see in the back of the pack
 
04:14:39.650 --> 04:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about some of our
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
legislative priorities for this year
 
04:14:44.150 --> 04:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're actually asking to expand what
 
04:14:45.950 --> 04:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
we're able to do with dual enrollment
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
because we think that we can make that a
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
more Strategic investment in New
 
04:14:52.250 --> 04:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as students
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
currently the scholarship program
 
04:14:56.510 --> 04:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
available for students taking stem and
 
04:14:59.090 --> 04:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
CTE courses limits them to two courses a
 
04:15:00.889 --> 04:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
year we'd like to expand that to up to
 
04:15:03.410 --> 04:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
five courses a year complementary to the
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
high school curriculum but allow a
 
04:15:07.790 --> 04:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
student to finish a full year or more of
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
college level learning while still in
 
04:15:12.650 --> 04:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
high school and again without incurring
 
04:15:15.889 --> 04:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
the expense or the debt of doing that
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
forgive me not because we think every
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
student needs to go to a four-year
 
04:15:21.229 --> 04:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
college or at least needs to go to a
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
four-year college right away but we
 
04:15:24.590 --> 04:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
think that students need to have
 
04:15:27.290 --> 04:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
opportunities in front of them and need
 
04:15:30.050 --> 04:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
to not be saddled by the expense and the
 
04:15:34.010 --> 04:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
barrier that cost per presents so we're
 
04:15:36.110 --> 04:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
trying to leverage one of the things
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
that we know we can do well which is
 
04:15:40.250 --> 04:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
help students get a head start in
 
04:15:42.650 --> 04:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
whatever academic and career path that
 
04:15:43.729 --> 04:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
they want
 
04:15:46.610 --> 04:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
one of the consequences of this approach
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
of doing more with dual enrollment
 
04:15:51.229 --> 04:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
helping students to save money helping
 
04:15:53.809 --> 04:15:53.819 align:start position:0%
families to save money our programs and
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
our enrollment are increasingly
 
04:15:57.650 --> 04:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
concentrated in areas that can't really
 
04:15:59.689 --> 04:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
be delivered in that way
 
04:16:01.910 --> 04:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
as you look through the packet one of
 
04:16:03.710 --> 04:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
the slides that I'm particularly proud
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
of the programs where we do deliver over
 
04:16:09.469 --> 04:16:09.479 align:start position:0%
the last 12 years over 3 400 nursing
 
04:16:11.929 --> 04:16:11.939 align:start position:0%
degrees conferred by a community college
 
04:16:14.150 --> 04:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
system it's a two-year program those
 
04:16:15.469 --> 04:16:15.479 align:start position:0%
students can go on to complete a
 
04:16:17.030 --> 04:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
bachelor's or Master's in nursing but
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
they're in the workforce in two years
 
04:16:20.689 --> 04:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
and virtually all of them staying here
 
04:16:22.189 --> 04:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because that's where
 
04:16:23.349 --> 04:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
they live
 
04:16:27.110 --> 04:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
too interestingly our nursing graduates
 
04:16:30.010 --> 04:16:30.020 align:start position:0%
are disproportionately students in that
 
04:16:33.410 --> 04:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
25 and older group and two-thirds of the
 
04:16:35.030 --> 04:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
graduates it used to be three quarters
 
04:16:36.710 --> 04:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
so it's it's starting to skew a little
 
04:16:39.349 --> 04:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
bit younger but still decidedly these
 
04:16:41.030 --> 04:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
are students who are coming back making
 
04:16:43.309 --> 04:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
commitments in their communities but
 
04:16:45.050 --> 04:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
because we're doing more with dual
 
04:16:47.210 --> 04:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
enrollment about 22 and a half percent
 
04:16:48.650 --> 04:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
of the courses we offer in dual
 
04:16:50.030 --> 04:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment happen to be in math
 
04:16:52.729 --> 04:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
significant share in English those are
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
not terribly expensive to be delivered
 
04:16:57.769 --> 04:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
but of course it is in Dental in nursing
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
in Radiology those Automotive welding
 
04:17:02.750 --> 04:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
you go through the list of programs that
 
04:17:05.090 --> 04:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
are still concentrated with us that's
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
where the expense accrues and we no
 
04:17:09.889 --> 04:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
longer have the ability to offset in
 
04:17:12.170 --> 04:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
some ways and that's why we are so
 
04:17:13.790 --> 04:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
appreciative of the support we have from
 
04:17:15.530 --> 04:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
the state the ability to continue to
 
04:17:17.330 --> 04:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
deliver the programs that we offer
 
04:17:19.729 --> 04:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
particularly the growing concentration
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
in those expensive to deliver programs
 
04:17:24.889 --> 04:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
is only possible because of the support
 
04:17:26.990 --> 04:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
that that you've provided us
 
04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm probably having gone through off
 
04:17:33.110 --> 04:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
Off Script on this I've probably missed
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
more than a few things that are
 
04:17:36.769 --> 04:17:36.779 align:start position:0%
important but if you've had a chance to
 
04:17:40.130 --> 04:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
go through this list and there's this
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
packet and if there are questions the
 
04:17:44.990 --> 04:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee has I'd be happy to answer
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mark are there
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee for the
 
04:17:50.750 --> 04:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
community college system yes uh
 
04:17:52.370 --> 04:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative Myler
 
04:17:54.050 --> 04:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:17:56.650 --> 04:17:56.660 align:start position:0%
being here and taking my question
 
04:17:59.210 --> 04:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
students who enter as a freshman
 
04:18:04.610 --> 04:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
can matriculate automatically to the
 
04:18:06.530 --> 04:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
university system
 
04:18:08.510 --> 04:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
how many students would you say or what
 
04:18:10.969 --> 04:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
percent of your students actually Who
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
start as a freshman I'm not talking
 
04:18:14.929 --> 04:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
about those who come back and get a
 
04:18:16.969 --> 04:18:16.979 align:start position:0%
certificate Etc but those who are in an
 
04:18:19.370 --> 04:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
academic program what percent of those
 
04:18:22.189 --> 04:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
students do ultimately matriculate into
 
04:18:26.150 --> 04:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
one of the University Systems schools
 
04:18:28.389 --> 04:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
um in recent years
 
04:18:31.729 --> 04:18:31.739 align:start position:0%
my time at Granny's day I was police say
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
granite state was the primary
 
04:18:35.389 --> 04:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
destination a typical year would be
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
between 250 and 260 University roughly
 
04:18:42.110 --> 04:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
the same Keenan Plymouth smaller numbers
 
04:18:44.809 --> 04:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
in aggregate close to 700 students
 
04:18:46.250 --> 04:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
transferring from the community college
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
system to the university system most
 
04:18:48.840 --> 04:18:52.510 align:start position:0%
system to the university system most
years

04:18:52.510 --> 04:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:55.370 --> 04:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
are there other
 
04:18:57.170 --> 04:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
states that have the same kind of
 
04:18:59.450 --> 04:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
matriculation uh process or are we
 
04:19:01.910 --> 04:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat unique in that opportunity for
 
04:19:01.920 --> 04:19:03.670 align:start position:0%
somewhat unique in that opportunity for
students

04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:19:06.830 --> 04:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
Most states have some form of
 
04:19:08.929 --> 04:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
articulation in the State of Florida the
 
04:19:10.429 --> 04:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
state of Virginia state of California
 
04:19:13.130 --> 04:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
for years have used community colleges
 
04:19:15.830 --> 04:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
as a way of managing the capacity
 
04:19:18.469 --> 04:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
University education is typically more
 
04:19:21.110 --> 04:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
expensive than community colleges and in
 
04:19:23.090 --> 04:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
states with large populations and
 
04:19:24.830 --> 04:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
particularly during periods of growth
 
04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
they've used community colleges as a
 
04:19:30.490 --> 04:19:30.500 align:start position:0%
more affordable entryway into four-year
 
04:19:33.710 --> 04:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
education so Most states have some
 
04:19:35.990 --> 04:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
structure like that you're welcome sir
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
Roxanne Belcher yeah did you end up
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking just for a general idea
 
04:19:44.450 --> 04:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
because we have obviously difficulty
 
04:19:46.250 --> 04:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
with um Workforce problems here in New
 
04:19:49.309 --> 04:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire getting enough people and jobs
 
04:19:51.050 --> 04:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
um of all the jobs that we have
 
04:19:52.429 --> 04:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
available in New Hampshire the jobs that
 
04:19:54.170 --> 04:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
we're having a hard time filling do you
 
04:19:56.269 --> 04:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
have any concept of
 
04:19:58.250 --> 04:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
um what percentage of those jobs might
 
04:19:58.260 --> 04:19:59.389 align:start position:0%
um what percentage of those jobs might
be

04:19:59.389 --> 04:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
um reasonably filled by the the type of
 
04:20:03.830 --> 04:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
education that you would receive through
 
04:20:06.050 --> 04:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
the community college system versus say
 
04:20:07.809 --> 04:20:07.819 align:start position:0%
a higher degree
 
04:20:10.849 --> 04:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
I'd be misleading to put a percentage I
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
would say most and you know one of the
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
things that's been interesting in in
 
04:20:18.410 --> 04:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
recent years is to watch as the labor
 
04:20:20.510 --> 04:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
markets become tighter employers have
 
04:20:23.450 --> 04:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
become more open to Alternative
 
04:20:26.030 --> 04:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
credentials and we're willing to train
 
04:20:28.969 --> 04:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
willing to do on job learning and to
 
04:20:31.490 --> 04:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
some degree that's one of the real
 
04:20:33.889 --> 04:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
opportunities is to blend experiential
 
04:20:35.229 --> 04:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
learning with what you can deliver
 
04:20:37.370 --> 04:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
didactically either a classroom or
 
04:20:40.429 --> 04:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
online for community colleges where
 
04:20:41.870 --> 04:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
three quarters of our students are
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
already working adults are already
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
balancing work in life if we can help
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
take some foundational skills and
 
04:20:50.990 --> 04:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge and put them into roles and
 
04:20:53.630 --> 04:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
provide the additional education you
 
04:20:56.210 --> 04:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
know again I'm not sure that there are a
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
whole lot of limitations that I've
 
04:21:01.130 --> 04:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
mentioned nursing is example but we've
 
04:21:02.809 --> 04:21:02.819 align:start position:0%
conferred in that same period of time
 
04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
probably about 800 certificates in
 
04:21:07.550 --> 04:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
accounting nearly a thousand in welding
 
04:21:12.170 --> 04:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
we graduate CDL qualified drivers when
 
04:21:13.610 --> 04:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
you go through whether it's Department
 
04:21:15.710 --> 04:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
of Transportation or administrative
 
04:21:19.070 --> 04:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
Services we could go through the wanted
 
04:21:21.469 --> 04:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
the help wanted list and I think we
 
04:21:23.090 --> 04:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
could do a pretty good job of matching
 
04:21:25.130 --> 04:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity with education
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that thank you sir further
 
04:21:30.530 --> 04:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
questions from that committee
 
04:21:30.540 --> 04:21:32.150 align:start position:0%
questions from that committee
yes

04:21:32.150 --> 04:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you and as
 
04:21:37.969 --> 04:21:37.979 align:start position:0%
to the dual enrollment what is being
 
04:21:39.710 --> 04:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
done for the initiative to encourage
 
04:21:41.570 --> 04:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
students to take advantage of those as
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
you said expanding into five stem
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
courses being offered through that
 
04:21:47.689 --> 04:21:47.699 align:start position:0%
scholarship and what is done for high
 
04:21:50.450 --> 04:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
schools to give those opportunities to
 
04:21:52.610 --> 04:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
students so they know about them and
 
04:21:54.110 --> 04:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
 
04:21:56.330 --> 04:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
McDonald director Doran can probably
 
04:21:59.210 --> 04:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
elaborate but each of our campuses has a
 
04:22:01.490 --> 04:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
running start coordinator working with
 
04:22:04.610 --> 04:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
high schools in each of those areas we
 
04:22:07.130 --> 04:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
do as much as we can to make visible
 
04:22:09.530 --> 04:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
this opportunity the ability to expand
 
04:22:12.050 --> 04:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
from two to five is still contingent on
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
funding but this is part of a larger
 
04:22:18.830 --> 04:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
Effort New Hampshire as you probably
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
know Governor yesterday and his
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
inaugural address was remarking on New
 
04:22:27.290 --> 04:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire having the lowest poverty rate
 
04:22:29.870 --> 04:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
in the country which is laudable but if
 
04:22:32.809 --> 04:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
you look at K-12 population 20 22
 
04:22:34.490 --> 04:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
percent of our students are eligible for
 
04:22:37.429 --> 04:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch The Future Has
 
04:22:39.469 --> 04:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
challenges for a lot of our students and
 
04:22:41.689 --> 04:22:41.699 align:start position:0%
we recognize the importance of creating
 
04:22:43.969 --> 04:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
opportunity Pathways that will be
 
04:22:46.370 --> 04:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
affordable combination of what we can do
 
04:22:48.769 --> 04:22:48.779 align:start position:0%
with dual enrollment programs and the
 
04:22:50.809 --> 04:22:50.819 align:start position:0%
consequence of Representative Ford's
 
04:22:53.330 --> 04:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
house bill 1530 which builds Pathways
 
04:22:54.889 --> 04:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
between the community college system
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
University system is a long-term
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
strategy for helping to ensure that more
 
04:23:02.450 --> 04:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's young people have those
 
04:23:02.460 --> 04:23:04.849 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's young people have those
opportunities

04:23:04.849 --> 04:23:04.859 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
04:23:12.050 --> 04:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
uh Mark uh we we've heard in the past
 
04:23:15.769 --> 04:23:15.779 align:start position:0%
that 60 of the kids coming out of high
 
04:23:18.590 --> 04:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
school going on to the community college
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
system required some kind of Remediation
 
04:23:23.570 --> 04:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
in mathematics of which
 
04:23:26.150 --> 04:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
50 of those never graduated now I
 
04:23:28.250 --> 04:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
understand you don't have that type of
 
04:23:30.530 --> 04:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
way of approaching that now that you're
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
trying to work with these students but
 
04:23:35.330 --> 04:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
are you still seeing kids arrive that do
 
04:23:38.210 --> 04:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
not have the mathematics understandings
 
04:23:40.309 --> 04:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
that they really need to make it through
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
your programs uh yeah absolutely that's
 
04:23:45.170 --> 04:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
the case and you can look at the annual
 
04:23:47.689 --> 04:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
assessment results for 11th graders and
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
recognize that you're going to have a
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
group of students on the cusp of
 
04:23:52.729 --> 04:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
graduating from high school who are
 
04:23:54.530 --> 04:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
still not well prepared for college
 
04:23:56.050 --> 04:23:56.060 align:start position:0%
level math
 
04:23:59.210 --> 04:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
the revealing sentiment is to use
 
04:24:01.130 --> 04:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
something called co-requisite rather
 
04:24:03.530 --> 04:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
than remedial courses putting students
 
04:24:05.990 --> 04:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
into college-level courses but with
 
04:24:08.809 --> 04:24:08.819 align:start position:0%
sufficient support to encourage or to
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
increase the likelihood of success the
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
remedial courses have not had a good
 
04:24:16.010 --> 04:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
track record for college math
 
04:24:18.410 --> 04:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
so this just to follow up to that and
 
04:24:20.150 --> 04:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
maybe it's better directed over to your
 
04:24:24.050 --> 04:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
your friend there Beth but um
 
04:24:27.110 --> 04:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
to determine if they're ready for a
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
college level mathematics course we used
 
04:24:33.410 --> 04:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
to give the Next Generation
 
04:24:33.420 --> 04:24:34.150 align:start position:0%
to give the Next Generation
um

04:24:34.150 --> 04:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:37.250 --> 04:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
accuplacer and if there's a score of 60
 
04:24:40.670 --> 04:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
or something you know are you giving not
 
04:24:43.010 --> 04:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
necessarily that assessment but some
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
other assessment now to understand if
 
04:24:47.090 --> 04:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
they are prepared so they don't end up
 
04:24:49.250 --> 04:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
spending all this money and not getting
 
04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
any return for it the approach is
 
04:24:54.590 --> 04:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
described as multi multiple modes of
 
04:24:57.469 --> 04:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
assessment it's placement testing it's
 
04:24:59.450 --> 04:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
looking at the high school transcript to
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
see what the math pathway has been to
 
04:25:03.830 --> 04:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
that point the students performance so
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
we try not to do a single high-stakes
 
04:25:09.229 --> 04:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
measure of this score turns into this
 
04:25:11.450 --> 04:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
placement but you know trying to help
 
04:25:13.610 --> 04:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
students make good decisions for where
 
04:25:15.469 --> 04:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
they are academically
 
04:25:18.050 --> 04:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
04:25:20.450 --> 04:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ford
 
04:25:22.790 --> 04:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
hello again good to see you sir thank
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
you for the acknowledgment of the bill
 
04:25:27.130 --> 04:25:27.140 align:start position:0%
that we've worked together to get done
 
04:25:29.570 --> 04:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh one of the questions that has
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
occurred to me as we look
 
04:25:34.610 --> 04:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
at a lot of the data that's coming out
 
04:25:38.510 --> 04:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
about uh people who are challenged or in
 
04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise not given what's considered
 
04:25:44.149 --> 04:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
Equitable opportunity
 
04:25:47.570 --> 04:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if you had noticed also
 
04:25:49.849 --> 04:25:49.859 align:start position:0%
that there's a group missing from there
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
and it may be a group which possibly is
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
a community colleges could uh could
 
04:25:57.769 --> 04:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
address and speaking of those people who
 
04:26:00.410 --> 04:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
are physically challenged the wheelchair
 
04:26:03.530 --> 04:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
athletes to my knowledge there's no
 
04:26:06.590 --> 04:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
wheelchair Athletics program in the
 
04:26:09.290 --> 04:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
school systems in New Hampshire there is
 
04:26:11.929 --> 04:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
one in an athletic group
 
04:26:14.750 --> 04:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
but it's not there and I know that it's
 
04:26:17.689 --> 04:26:17.699 align:start position:0%
very Broad in other areas other states
 
04:26:20.090 --> 04:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
the college where I was president had a
 
04:26:22.670 --> 04:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
varsity wheelchair basketball
 
04:26:25.370 --> 04:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
it was that much of a commit but it
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
seems like they've been lost somewhere
 
04:26:30.229 --> 04:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
in the equity and I was wondering if you
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
had any perceptions about how the
 
04:26:35.809 --> 04:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
community colleges might address that
 
04:26:35.819 --> 04:26:36.710 align:start position:0%
community colleges might address that
need

04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
can I just ask a clarifying question to
 
04:26:41.410 --> 04:26:41.420 align:start position:0%
you before for Mark handles that I
 
04:26:44.030 --> 04:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
thought we passed Unified sports last
 
04:26:44.040 --> 04:26:46.130 align:start position:0%
thought we passed Unified sports last
year

04:26:46.130 --> 04:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:26:48.170 --> 04:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
perhaps in Woodcock there are Unified
 
04:26:49.610 --> 04:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
sports I'm not sure what the college are
 
04:26:50.870 --> 04:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
at the high school level yeah at the
 
04:26:52.969 --> 04:26:52.979 align:start position:0%
high school level I'm just talking today
 
04:26:54.349 --> 04:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
at lunch I thought yesterday was
 
04:26:56.510 --> 04:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
terrific yeah
 
04:26:56.520 --> 04:26:57.950 align:start position:0%
terrific yeah
good

04:26:57.950 --> 04:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:26:57.960 --> 04:26:58.729 align:start position:0%
good
um

04:26:58.729 --> 04:26:58.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:01.070 --> 04:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
um in competitive Sports some of our
 
04:27:03.710 --> 04:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
campuses do offer that I can't speak
 
04:27:06.590 --> 04:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
many detail in response to your question
 
04:27:09.889 --> 04:27:09.899 align:start position:0%
so I apologize no it's not that it's
 
04:27:13.729 --> 04:27:13.739 align:start position:0%
it's an idea that has not grown very
 
04:27:16.010 --> 04:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
rapidly in New Hampshire and I thought
 
04:27:18.290 --> 04:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
of it as one possibility for addressing
 
04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
those students because they do very well
 
04:27:22.969 --> 04:27:22.979 align:start position:0%
in their academics they have a very high
 
04:27:26.110 --> 04:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
graduation rate and Career Success so
 
04:27:28.670 --> 04:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
that that's what prompted my connection
 
04:27:32.210 --> 04:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
was I'll say when you pose the question
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
my first thought actually turned to UNH
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
and Northeast passage which is a an
 
04:27:41.450 --> 04:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
extraordinary organization within UNH
 
04:27:43.870 --> 04:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
that does a great deal with adaptive
 
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
Recreation and competitive Sports to the
 
04:27:49.550 --> 04:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
level of of international paralympians
 
04:27:51.649 --> 04:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
an area if you're interested in
 
04:27:54.769 --> 04:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
president Dean can connect you to that
 
04:27:56.570 --> 04:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:59.689 --> 04:27:59.699 align:start position:0%
yes represent Woodcock
 
04:27:59.699 --> 04:28:00.769 align:start position:0%
yes represent Woodcock
um

04:28:00.769 --> 04:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:02.990 --> 04:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
Chancellor thank you for for being here
 
04:28:04.809 --> 04:28:04.819 align:start position:0%
uh going through this with us every year
 
04:28:07.610 --> 04:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the I was going to
 
04:28:09.170 --> 04:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
rephrase the old term of remedial
 
04:28:11.809 --> 04:28:11.819 align:start position:0%
classes uh you I had a term I hadn't
 
04:28:14.929 --> 04:28:14.939 align:start position:0%
been aware of but uh is there any uh
 
04:28:16.370 --> 04:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
connection in the community college
 
04:28:19.849 --> 04:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
system between I what you're identifying
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
as uh academic needs of students coming
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
from the typical K-12 system uh
 
04:28:31.729 --> 04:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
getting that information back to these
 
04:28:32.809 --> 04:28:32.819 align:start position:0%
are Pathway to get the information
 
04:28:35.090 --> 04:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
packed to the curricular Folks at the
 
04:28:39.050 --> 04:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
high schools that send you or to the doe
 
04:28:41.689 --> 04:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
as we Guys these particular concepts are
 
04:28:43.550 --> 04:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
missing with these particular core
 
04:28:45.889 --> 04:28:45.899 align:start position:0%
courses for youngsters we now offer a
 
04:28:48.530 --> 04:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
missing in terms of I guess is there
 
04:28:51.710 --> 04:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
is there a way for us to find out or if
 
04:28:53.929 --> 04:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
the schools particularly K-12 schools
 
04:28:57.649 --> 04:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
what courses really need more before
 
04:28:59.090 --> 04:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
they get to you is there any that
 
04:29:00.649 --> 04:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
linkage back between a community college
 
04:29:03.649 --> 04:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
system in the high school or doe I don't
 
04:29:05.929 --> 04:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
I don't know thanks for the question I
 
04:29:08.210 --> 04:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's currently a
 
04:29:10.729 --> 04:29:10.739 align:start position:0%
reporting mechanism for that I can
 
04:29:14.330 --> 04:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
recall from 17 years of work at UNH that
 
04:29:16.490 --> 04:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
there was a standard report that
 
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
provided feedback to high schools on
 
04:29:20.929 --> 04:29:20.939 align:start position:0%
performance for students in certain core
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
courses during the first year I'm not
 
04:29:25.610 --> 04:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
aware that there's a similar report that
 
04:29:28.849 --> 04:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
that we issue
 
04:29:28.859 --> 04:30:20.469 align:start position:0%
that we issue
foreign

04:30:20.469 --> 04:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:23.570 --> 04:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
conferences every year can back and
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.689 --> 04:30:29.699 align:start position:0%
that program has been
 
04:30:32.590 --> 04:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
running for three or four years now
 
04:30:35.809 --> 04:30:35.819 align:start position:0%
so that gave us an opportunity to make
 
04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
this one High School
 
04:30:41.870 --> 04:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you my colleague director Doran of
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
college access programs for the
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
community college system make a
 
04:30:47.090 --> 04:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
Chancellor thank you Mr chair yeah the
 
04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
math learning communities program
 
04:30:50.030 --> 04:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
there's a chapter of law if you look in
 
04:30:52.550 --> 04:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
the statutes on that uh about three
 
04:30:55.429 --> 04:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
years ago is when we started we had 38
 
04:30:57.290 --> 04:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
high schools participating in that
 
04:30:59.809 --> 04:30:59.819 align:start position:0%
program and we were seeing great gains
 
04:31:02.030 --> 04:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
there was a monies that Beth had gotten
 
04:31:05.769 --> 04:31:05.779 align:start position:0%
Grant wise it was 200 000 I believe a
 
04:31:10.309 --> 04:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
and what happened is we refuse as the
 
04:31:13.250 --> 04:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
state to refund the program
 
04:31:16.250 --> 04:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately then we're we're
 
04:31:18.290 --> 04:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
losing the advance of the two courses
 
04:31:20.450 --> 04:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
math foundations and the quantitative
 
04:31:23.929 --> 04:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
math if they get below 65 on the
 
04:31:26.090 --> 04:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
accuplacer rather than going from
 
04:31:28.670 --> 04:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
Algebra 1 to Algebra 2 then they go into
 
04:31:31.790 --> 04:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
the other right now which deals with
 
04:31:34.250 --> 04:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
learning styles teaching styles and and
 
04:31:36.590 --> 04:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
really does a wonderful job we were
 
04:31:38.929 --> 04:31:38.939 align:start position:0%
seeing great success for two hundred
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars this house Let It Drop
 
04:31:44.809 --> 04:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
and so that bill has been put forward
 
04:31:46.729 --> 04:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
again this year in conjunction with the
 
04:31:48.769 --> 04:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
community college system and we're
 
04:31:51.290 --> 04:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
hoping to push this thing through so we
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
can address this issue of mathematics
 
04:31:55.610 --> 04:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
and so we can adjust the issue of
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
getting that coordination you're looking
 
04:32:00.290 --> 04:32:00.300 align:start position:0%
for between the high schools and the
 
04:32:02.090 --> 04:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
04:32:07.729 --> 04:32:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
hello thank you for taking my question I
 
04:32:12.290 --> 04:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
was just looking through this
 
04:32:13.969 --> 04:32:13.979 align:start position:0%
material here and the thing that struck
 
04:32:18.050 --> 04:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
me is the ratio of female to male
 
04:32:21.170 --> 04:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
students is very high I'm just looking
 
04:32:24.530 --> 04:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
at 177 versus 23
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
um maybe that's one of the highest 65 to
 
04:32:28.429 --> 04:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
34 and I'm just curious it just struck
 
04:32:31.550 --> 04:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
me so I'm just curious as to what you
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
would attribute that to
 
04:32:36.410 --> 04:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
um that's 77-23 is River Valley
 
04:32:38.750 --> 04:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
Community College and it's particularly
 
04:32:40.849 --> 04:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
attributable to the concentration of
 
04:32:43.130 --> 04:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
Health Care related programs that they
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
deliver if you look across the colleges
 
04:32:49.250 --> 04:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
there are different sets of programs and
 
04:32:52.130 --> 04:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
certain programs tend to draw
 
04:32:54.830 --> 04:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
differently from the population dental
 
04:32:57.649 --> 04:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
dental hygiene program than HCI 98
 
04:33:01.130 --> 04:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
female as an example nursing
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
disproportionately or I should say
 
04:33:02.880 --> 04:33:04.209 align:start position:0%
disproportionately or I should say
significantly

04:33:04.209 --> 04:33:04.219 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
favoring women automotive technology
 
04:33:10.010 --> 04:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
welding more often than not men so it
 
04:33:12.830 --> 04:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
really is a function of program mix and
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
the other piece that's unique to River
 
04:33:14.879 --> 04:33:16.029 align:start position:0%
the other piece that's unique to River
Valley

04:33:16.029 --> 04:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
Valley
 
04:33:18.650 --> 04:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
significantly larger share of older
 
04:33:20.810 --> 04:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
students matriculating there rather than
 
04:33:22.490 --> 04:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
students coming directly out of high
 
04:33:26.209 --> 04:33:26.219 align:start position:0%
school and part of that is the not a
 
04:33:28.189 --> 04:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
large number of high school graduates in
 
04:33:33.709 --> 04:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:35.209 --> 04:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay we're at pretty much at the end of
 
04:33:40.250 --> 04:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
the higher education and do you have
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
anything else for us if I might yes and
 
04:33:44.990 --> 04:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
took a moment to refresh my mind on
 
04:33:45.000 --> 04:33:45.949 align:start position:0%
took a moment to refresh my mind on
script

04:33:45.949 --> 04:33:45.959 align:start position:0%
script
 
04:33:48.051 --> 04:33:48.061 align:start position:0%
um on what is numbered as page seven
 
04:33:51.410 --> 04:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
you'll see a graphic there and it is the
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
one that I would draw your attention to
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
because this has come up in previous
 
04:33:58.670 --> 04:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
discussions we haven't completely froze
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
intuition but it's only increased five
 
04:34:04.449 --> 04:34:04.459 align:start position:0%
dollars or two percent over the last
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
04:34:09.529 --> 04:34:09.539 align:start position:0%
and as you'll see in that graph had we
 
04:34:11.570 --> 04:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
allowed inflation not higher education
 
04:34:14.689 --> 04:34:14.699 align:start position:0%
inflation which is typically twice as as
 
04:34:17.869 --> 04:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
uh virulent as as consumer inflation but
 
04:34:19.490 --> 04:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
if we had simply allowed inflation to
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
run its course that figure would be
 
04:34:21.840 --> 04:34:22.689 align:start position:0%
run its course that figure would be
about

04:34:22.689 --> 04:34:22.699 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:34:26.529 --> 04:34:26.539 align:start position:0%
278 dollars rather than 215 dollars
 
04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's part of the effort to ensure
 
04:34:31.730 --> 04:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
affordability we've been trying to hold
 
04:34:34.730 --> 04:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
the line on on costs for students the
 
04:34:36.890 --> 04:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment trying to find ways to
 
04:34:38.631 --> 04:34:38.641 align:start position:0%
help students progress through and
 
04:34:41.510 --> 04:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
complete college with less cost
 
04:34:43.789 --> 04:34:43.799 align:start position:0%
in other states and particularly those
 
04:34:45.890 --> 04:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
that surround us as a growing interest
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
in free community college and we're
 
04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to see if we can't make a
 
04:34:55.750 --> 04:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
serious run at that this year one of the
 
04:34:58.429 --> 04:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
favorable opportunities if you will the
 
04:34:59.929 --> 04:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
federal government has increased the
 
04:35:01.869 --> 04:35:01.879 align:start position:0%
Pell Grant limit for next year
 
04:35:04.369 --> 04:35:04.379 align:start position:0%
approaching sixty nine hundred dollars
 
04:35:07.010 --> 04:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
not quite enough to cover tuition in a
 
04:35:08.449 --> 04:35:08.459 align:start position:0%
lot of states that talk about free
 
04:35:10.789 --> 04:35:10.799 align:start position:0%
Community College their tuition is
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
already low enough that Pell Grant
 
04:35:14.810 --> 04:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
covers it it's a fairly simple thing to
 
04:35:17.209 --> 04:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
do but we think we're close enough and
 
04:35:20.090 --> 04:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
it's worth reaching we still think that
 
04:35:22.010 --> 04:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
that puts our students under a lot of
 
04:35:23.631 --> 04:35:23.641 align:start position:0%
pressure it doesn't really address the
 
04:35:25.250 --> 04:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
needs of part-time students adult
 
04:35:27.890 --> 04:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
students students who have exhausted
 
04:35:29.689 --> 04:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
eight eligibility through enrollment and
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%
other institutions but we think that
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
this issue to try and Achieve greater
 
04:35:36.051 --> 04:35:36.061 align:start position:0%
affordability for our students and their
 
04:35:38.449 --> 04:35:38.459 align:start position:0%
families is a critical part of our
 
04:35:41.150 --> 04:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
mission on behalf of New Hampshire so
 
04:35:43.670 --> 04:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
you will see and hear more about that as
 
04:35:46.670 --> 04:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
we go through this legislative session
 
04:35:47.869 --> 04:35:47.879 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's very
 
04:35:50.029 --> 04:35:50.039 align:start position:0%
interesting I'd like to hear more about
 
04:35:50.039 --> 04:35:52.189 align:start position:0%
interesting I'd like to hear more about
that

04:35:52.189 --> 04:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
um any further questions for Mark
 
04:35:58.070 --> 04:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
Rubinstein yes
 
04:35:59.810 --> 04:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
is it okay to just make a comment as
 
04:36:02.869 --> 04:36:02.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:05.090 --> 04:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'm in Sullivan County and I just wanted
 
04:36:06.650 --> 04:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
to say that River Valley Community
 
04:36:08.689 --> 04:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
College is very well respected in the
 
04:36:11.449 --> 04:36:11.459 align:start position:0%
community and I think I literally know
 
04:36:12.890 --> 04:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people who wouldn't have
 
04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
gone to college without the programs
 
04:36:16.490 --> 04:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
there who are staying in New Hampshire
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
and gainfully employed it's pretty
 
04:36:21.949 --> 04:36:21.959 align:start position:0%
impressive thank you and it's very
 
04:36:23.689 --> 04:36:23.699 align:start position:0%
impressive and I hope nothing I said
 
04:36:25.490 --> 04:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
cause you to think I felt otherwise
 
04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
about one of our Seven Sisters River
 
04:36:30.769 --> 04:36:30.779 align:start position:0%
Valley is also by the way the the heart
 
04:36:33.709 --> 04:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
of our LPN program brought back at the
 
04:36:35.810 --> 04:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
request of the state a couple of years
 
04:36:39.650 --> 04:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
ago originally offered in uh
 
04:36:43.849 --> 04:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
um Lebanon now available in
 
04:36:43.859 --> 04:36:44.529 align:start position:0%
um Lebanon now available in
um

04:36:44.529 --> 04:36:44.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:47.289 --> 04:36:47.299 align:start position:0%
uh Laconia
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
Littleton it'll soon to be in Nashua and
 
04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester it's it's serving as the hub
 
04:36:54.949 --> 04:36:54.959 align:start position:0%
for being able to deliver programs
 
04:36:57.051 --> 04:36:57.061 align:start position:0%
across the state with only one
 
04:36:59.090 --> 04:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
institutional accreditation required

04:38:14.340 --> 04:38:15.949 align:start position:0%
 
difference

04:38:15.949 --> 04:38:15.959 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:38:17.810 --> 04:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
both have been very helpful when we
 
04:38:19.730 --> 04:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
tried to take courses and have them
 
04:38:21.410 --> 04:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
transferred from one level to the other
 
04:38:23.689 --> 04:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
level and we went through a lot of work
 
04:38:25.970 --> 04:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
last year with representative Ford and
 
04:38:27.949 --> 04:38:27.959 align:start position:0%
got that bill passed and
 
04:38:30.349 --> 04:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
a great job I look forward to more of
 
04:38:33.949 --> 04:38:33.959 align:start position:0%

04:39:54.890 --> 04:39:54.900 align:start position:0%

04:39:59.990 --> 04:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
on the school boards Association and and
 
04:40:02.030 --> 04:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
who we are and what we do we're a
 
04:40:04.970 --> 04:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
private non-profit organization we have
 
04:40:07.850 --> 04:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
about 161 school boards that pay dues to
 
04:40:10.250 --> 04:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
the association and in return for those
 
04:40:12.310 --> 04:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
dues we provide a variety of services
 
04:40:15.770 --> 04:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
first and foremost our legal and policy
 
04:40:18.708 --> 04:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
Services we have a staff attorney that
 
04:40:21.050 --> 04:40:21.060 align:start position:0%

day on most matters of school board
 
04:40:28.730 --> 04:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
governance right to no law budgeting
 
04:40:31.788 --> 04:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining student discipline
 
04:40:34.130 --> 04:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
staff discipline interpreting various
 
04:40:35.690 --> 04:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
statutes interpreting Department of
 
04:40:37.970 --> 04:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
Education rules so on and so forth
 
04:40:39.948 --> 04:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
anything that can happen in a in a
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
school on any given day nhsba is able to
 
04:40:44.448 --> 04:40:44.458 align:start position:0%
provide some resources and service and
 
04:40:46.670 --> 04:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
assistance to school districts
 
04:40:49.130 --> 04:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
the second primary service that nhsba
 
04:40:52.490 --> 04:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
provides is our policy Services as some
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
of the newer members may know
 
04:40:57.470 --> 04:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
um school boards are essentially policy
 
04:41:00.050 --> 04:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
making bodies and there are a variety of
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
laws both state and federal that require
 
04:41:05.690 --> 04:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
School boards have a particular policy
 
04:41:09.110 --> 04:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
on in in a policy manual for example you
 
04:41:10.910 --> 04:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
have to have a policy on bullying for
 
04:41:12.410 --> 04:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
example you have to have a policy on
 
04:41:14.810 --> 04:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion of students so
 
04:41:17.990 --> 04:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
nhsba through our staff attorney drafts
 
04:41:20.570 --> 04:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
sample policies and then we provide
 
04:41:22.730 --> 04:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
those to local school districts to
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
tailor and amend and fit to their own
 
04:41:27.708 --> 04:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
particular needs recognizing that the
 
04:41:29.448 --> 04:41:29.458 align:start position:0%
policy needs in Manchester may be
 
04:41:31.070 --> 04:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
different than the policy needs in state
 
04:41:33.610 --> 04:41:33.620 align:start position:0%
Berlin or Colebrook for example
 
04:41:36.350 --> 04:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
in addition to providing the sample
 
04:41:38.690 --> 04:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
policies we do two policy updates per
 
04:41:41.090 --> 04:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
year we do one we call it our fall
 
04:41:43.730 --> 04:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
policy update it usually comes out we
 
04:41:45.708 --> 04:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
usually distribute it around Labor Day
 
04:41:48.650 --> 04:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
and and the policies in that policy
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
update always follow the legislative
 
04:41:53.810 --> 04:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
session the session ends in May or June
 
04:41:55.670 --> 04:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
we review the bills and what's become
 
04:41:57.350 --> 04:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
law wait for the Governor's signature
 
04:41:59.990 --> 04:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
over the summer and then we review all
 
04:42:02.448 --> 04:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
the laws to see what Paul what bills
 
04:42:05.150 --> 04:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
might have a policy impact it may not be
 
04:42:07.490 --> 04:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
a policy that's required by law for
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
example but it may have a the law may
 
04:42:12.948 --> 04:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
impact either an existing policy or may
 
04:42:14.810 --> 04:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
require a new policy or a modification
 
04:42:17.270 --> 04:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
to an existing policy so we do two
 
04:42:19.550 --> 04:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
policy updates per year we work uh the
 
04:42:21.288 --> 04:42:21.298 align:start position:0%
one in the fall and then we do another
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
sort of General update usually in the
 
04:42:25.190 --> 04:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
spring then April or May sort of time
 
04:42:27.890 --> 04:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
frame in addition to those policy
 
04:42:30.288 --> 04:42:30.298 align:start position:0%
updates and drafting sample policies for
 
04:42:32.510 --> 04:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
school boards to use we do do policy
 
04:42:34.490 --> 04:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
reviews for school districts where are
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
these school board or the school
 
04:42:38.930 --> 04:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
district will send us I still like them
 
04:42:41.030 --> 04:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
when I did it I still did them all
 
04:42:43.368 --> 04:42:43.378 align:start position:0%
um hard copy I like the manual so I
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
could write my own notes and then things
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
of that nature on them our staff
 
04:42:48.770 --> 04:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
attorney now he's sort of got his own
 
04:42:50.570 --> 04:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
system but a school district will send
 
04:42:52.910 --> 04:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
us their policy manual and we will
 
04:42:55.490 --> 04:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
review it we'll go through word forward
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
Page by Page line by line to make sure
 
04:42:59.510 --> 04:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
that it's up to date to make sure that
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
it reflects current law to make sure
 
04:43:03.170 --> 04:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
that they have all the sample policies
 
04:43:04.670 --> 04:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
that are all the policies that are
 
04:43:06.708 --> 04:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
required by law and then we'll write a
 
04:43:08.270 --> 04:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
review and send that out and hopefully
 
04:43:09.890 --> 04:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
give the board a school the school board
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
plan on how to implement the changes
 
04:43:15.350 --> 04:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
that nhsba is recommending so that's
 
04:43:18.350 --> 04:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
legal and policy the third primary
 
04:43:21.050 --> 04:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
aspect of what nhsba does is what I'll
 
04:43:24.708 --> 04:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
just call our training we do probably 15
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
to 20 webinars a year Becky was doing
 
04:43:30.110 --> 04:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
one on a legislative preview actually at
 
04:43:33.050 --> 04:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
one o'clock this afternoon and was April
 
04:43:34.730 --> 04:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
and no noon I'm sorry at noon and was
 
04:43:36.590 --> 04:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
able to get down here by one o'clock so
 
04:43:39.368 --> 04:43:39.378 align:start position:0%
we do about 15 or 20 webinars every year
 
04:43:42.890 --> 04:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
again mostly on matters that are within
 
04:43:44.990 --> 04:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
the school board's purview collective
 
04:43:48.170 --> 04:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
bargaining budgeting rights and law we
 
04:43:49.670 --> 04:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
do do a new school board member
 
04:43:52.368 --> 04:43:52.378 align:start position:0%
orientation webinar in April and May
 
04:43:55.490 --> 04:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
following March elections and in
 
04:43:57.770 --> 04:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
addition to the to the 15 or 20 webinars
 
04:44:00.410 --> 04:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
that we do between my staff attorney and
 
04:44:04.128 --> 04:44:04.138 align:start position:0%
I we will do anywhere between 40 and
 
04:44:07.070 --> 04:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
maybe 60 or 70 individual trainings
 
04:44:08.690 --> 04:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
every single year we're a school board
 
04:44:11.208 --> 04:44:11.218 align:start position:0%
or the superintendent will call us and
 
04:44:13.610 --> 04:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll go up or down or left or
 
04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
right depending on where their district
 
04:44:14.878 --> 04:44:16.310 align:start position:0%
right depending on where their district
is

04:44:16.310 --> 04:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:44:18.350 --> 04:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
um uh and uh and provide a training
 
04:44:20.090 --> 04:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes it trolls and responsibilities
 
04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's right to know law
 
04:44:23.930 --> 04:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's collective bargaining
 
04:44:26.270 --> 04:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's having an effective
 
04:44:27.890 --> 04:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
meeting we get a lot of requests for
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
those so
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
um those are the primary the the primary
 
04:44:34.250 --> 04:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
aspects relative to our training
 
04:44:35.810 --> 04:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
um personally that's my favorite part of
 
04:44:37.970 --> 04:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
the job I enjoy going out to the small
 
04:44:39.770 --> 04:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
towns in New Hampshire and the little
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
elementary schools that I wouldn't
 
04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
otherwise have an opportunity to visit
 
04:44:44.628 --> 04:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
and actually see our members and
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
actually talk to our members it's easy
 
04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
for me to say at my office and Concord
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
and think of think of maybe some good
 
04:44:52.190 --> 04:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
ideas maybe some not so good ideas but
 
04:44:54.230 --> 04:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
going out meeting our members where they
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
are is my person is my favorite aspect
 
04:45:00.590 --> 04:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
of of the job in addition uh we do um
 
04:45:02.930 --> 04:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
some other ancillary Services we do do
 
04:45:05.868 --> 04:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
superintendent searches we do anywhere
 
04:45:08.090 --> 04:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
between three and eight of those a year
 
04:45:09.948 --> 04:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
I think we're currently engaged in about
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
four or five across the state I imagine
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
we may get a couple more this spring and
 
04:45:16.910 --> 04:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
we do strategic planning for school
 
04:45:19.250 --> 04:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
boards as well too at any given time
 
04:45:20.930 --> 04:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
we've got two or three districts that
 
04:45:23.390 --> 04:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
we're working with on engaging strategic
 
04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
planning so I wanted to lay the
 
04:45:27.170 --> 04:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
groundwork for the majority of what
 
04:45:29.990 --> 04:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
nhsba does that that's the bulk of of
 
04:45:34.190 --> 04:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
the services nhsba provides we do are we
 
04:45:36.110 --> 04:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
are engaged in legislative advocacy as
 
04:45:38.150 --> 04:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
you can tell Becky and I are both
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
wearing the orange badges we are
 
04:45:41.510 --> 04:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
registered lobbyists we fill out the
 
04:45:44.448 --> 04:45:44.458 align:start position:0%
reports we register every year and
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
lobbying the legislative with the
 
04:45:49.128 --> 04:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
legislative work that nhsba does
 
04:45:51.590 --> 04:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
accounts for probably less than 10
 
04:45:54.110 --> 04:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
percent of of what we actually do we
 
04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of hours down here tracking
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of bills obviously speaking with
 
04:46:01.128 --> 04:46:01.138 align:start position:0%
the legislators going to helping um
 
04:46:03.530 --> 04:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
draft bills from time to time helping
 
04:46:05.090 --> 04:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
helping with amendments from time to
 
04:46:05.100 --> 04:46:06.170 align:start position:0%
helping with amendments from time to
time

04:46:06.170 --> 04:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:46:08.570 --> 04:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
um but I I I don't want the new members
 
04:46:10.128 --> 04:46:10.138 align:start position:0%
to think that all we do is come down
 
04:46:11.750 --> 04:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
here and Lobby and advocate for either
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
more money or for this or against that
 
04:46:16.730 --> 04:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
and the the legislative work is is a
 
04:46:19.128 --> 04:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
fraction of of what we do our Prime
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility is providing the services
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
to school boards
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
um as a resource and as assistance to um
 
04:46:27.650 --> 04:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh you know to those school boards I I
 
04:46:29.690 --> 04:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
imagine at one point or another I have
 
04:46:31.970 --> 04:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
been I don't know where all everybody is
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
from I know most of the the returning
 
04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
members I know where your communities
 
04:46:38.510 --> 04:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
chances are I've been to I've been to
 
04:46:40.128 --> 04:46:40.138 align:start position:0%
your communities many times I've been to
 
04:46:42.410 --> 04:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
Abrams at April last summer I've been to
 
04:46:45.530 --> 04:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
Hudson a number of times representative
 
04:46:48.288 --> 04:46:48.298 align:start position:0%
um uh represent cascad and I have worked
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
together many many times over the years
 
04:46:52.010 --> 04:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
so that's certainly been to Manchester
 
04:46:54.650 --> 04:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
as you know representative so
 
04:46:56.150 --> 04:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
um you know we truly are Statewide
 
04:46:58.310 --> 04:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
organization Torero tried to provide
 
04:47:01.070 --> 04:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
those Services the assistance
 
04:47:02.868 --> 04:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
um for the school districts that's what
 
04:47:05.150 --> 04:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do relative to our
 
04:47:06.530 --> 04:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
testimony though
 
04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
um uh I will in here I'm sorry I didn't
 
04:47:12.170 --> 04:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
get a chance to to number the pages
 
04:47:14.510 --> 04:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
um but if you turn to the the second the
 
04:47:16.010 --> 04:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
second page and I'm not going to go
 
04:47:17.448 --> 04:47:17.458 align:start position:0%
through all these by any means it's
 
04:47:19.730 --> 04:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
policies resolutions and statement of
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
beliefs manual the positions that nhsba
 
04:47:26.810 --> 04:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
takes here at the legislature Are Holy
 
04:47:29.990 --> 04:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
um uh uh a developed by our locals by
 
04:47:31.610 --> 04:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
our school board members it's not myself
 
04:47:33.890 --> 04:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
thinking it's a good idea it's not Ms
 
04:47:35.628 --> 04:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
Wilson thinking this is a good idea or a
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
bad idea we have a delegate assembly
 
04:47:40.788 --> 04:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
every year which is akin to a your town
 
04:47:43.190 --> 04:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
meeting your school district meeting and
 
04:47:44.930 --> 04:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
I'll remember submit proposed
 
04:47:44.940 --> 04:47:46.970 align:start position:0%
I'll remember submit proposed
resolutions

04:47:46.970 --> 04:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
resolutions
 
04:47:49.368 --> 04:47:49.378 align:start position:0%
um and then we discussed them we debate
 
04:47:51.770 --> 04:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
them and and we go through them and the
 
04:47:53.448 --> 04:47:53.458 align:start position:0%
body whoever shows up at our delegate
 
04:47:55.190 --> 04:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
assembly they vote on the positions that
 
04:47:57.530 --> 04:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
nhsba takes I want to be clear about
 
04:47:59.570 --> 04:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
that aspect as well too that it's our
 
04:48:02.750 --> 04:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
members and and and in some cases your
 
04:48:05.208 --> 04:48:05.218 align:start position:0%
your constituents that are determining
 
04:48:06.948 --> 04:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
the the positions that the association
 
04:48:09.890 --> 04:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
takes so you'll often hear us testified
 
04:48:12.170 --> 04:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
when we do when especially in our
 
04:48:14.510 --> 04:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony you know I will say
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
nhsba supports this bill because and
 
04:48:18.590 --> 04:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
then I'll try and tie it back to a
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
specific resolution or nhsba opposes
 
04:48:23.150 --> 04:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
this bill because and then try and tie
 
04:48:25.430 --> 04:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
it back to a specific resolution so
 
04:48:27.770 --> 04:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
we've got a basis as to why nhsba is
 
04:48:30.770 --> 04:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
taking the positions that we take so the
 
04:48:33.470 --> 04:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
the the the the leading documents after
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
the cover page are the nhsba resolutions
 
04:48:38.330 --> 04:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
the existing resolutions and what we
 
04:48:40.610 --> 04:48:40.620 align:start position:0%
call continuing resolutions
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
um they have to be adopted for three
 
04:48:43.788 --> 04:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
consecutive years before they move into
 
04:48:46.070 --> 04:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
our statement of beliefs manual that's a
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
in a side not necessarily important for
 
04:48:50.810 --> 04:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
for this committee but also included
 
04:48:52.910 --> 04:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
with this document just to sort of give
 
04:48:54.670 --> 04:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
you a sense of who we are and what we do
 
04:48:57.530 --> 04:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
we do do a legislative summary every
 
04:48:59.690 --> 04:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
year I didn't print out and provide
 
04:49:01.128 --> 04:49:01.138 align:start position:0%
copies for everybody because it's about
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
40 or 50 pages long but it's on our
 
04:49:05.570 --> 04:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
website it's free access it's not
 
04:49:08.030 --> 04:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
password protected or anything if you go
 
04:49:08.040 --> 04:49:08.708 align:start position:0%
password protected or anything if you go
to

04:49:08.708 --> 04:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:49:11.150 --> 04:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
nhsba.org and you should be able to find
 
04:49:13.490 --> 04:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
it under a documents tab if you can't by
 
04:49:15.650 --> 04:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
all means email myself or email Ms
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
Wilson and we'll be able to get it to
 
04:49:19.490 --> 04:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
you but I wanted to just sort of show
 
04:49:21.708 --> 04:49:21.718 align:start position:0%
you that we do do a legislative summary
 
04:49:23.690 --> 04:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
every year in the middle of the document
 
04:49:25.788 --> 04:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
I did print off the cover page and sort
 
04:49:28.128 --> 04:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
of the table of contents if you will so
 
04:49:29.570 --> 04:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
you can get a flavor of what it looks
 
04:49:31.490 --> 04:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
like but if you want a copy of that let
 
04:49:34.010 --> 04:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
me know go to our website and and you
 
04:49:36.170 --> 04:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
should be able to find it the other
 
04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
aspect the other documents that are
 
04:49:40.128 --> 04:49:40.138 align:start position:0%
included in here sort of the the last
 
04:49:43.310 --> 04:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
maybe third or so is um the training
 
04:49:45.230 --> 04:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
document that we use for our roles and
 
04:49:47.570 --> 04:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
responsibilities training where we sort
 
04:49:49.788 --> 04:49:49.798 align:start position:0%
of highlight the responsibilities of the
 
04:49:50.810 --> 04:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
school board to highlight the
 
04:49:52.610 --> 04:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of school
 
04:49:54.890 --> 04:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
superintendents and administrators and
 
04:49:54.900 --> 04:49:55.850 align:start position:0%
superintendents and administrators and
then

04:49:55.850 --> 04:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:49:58.010 --> 04:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
um you know sort of you know the best
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
practices if you will is sort of that
 
04:50:02.448 --> 04:50:02.458 align:start position:0%
gray area that it's really not clear and
 
04:50:03.890 --> 04:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
the relation working relationship
 
04:50:06.890 --> 04:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
between school boards um superintendents
 
04:50:09.110 --> 04:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
the administrative team so on and so
 
04:50:11.090 --> 04:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
forth so
 
04:50:13.970 --> 04:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
um I think my my emails on the on the
 
04:50:16.190 --> 04:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
cover page as Wilson's emails on the

statutes of the Department of Education
 
04:50:33.948 --> 04:50:33.958 align:start position:0%
rules that are not necessarily pertinent
 
04:50:35.690 --> 04:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
to the work that you're doing here or to
 
04:50:37.730 --> 04:50:37.740 align:start position:0%

here to be we're here to be assistive to
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
this Committee in any way that we can be
 
04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
whether it relates to life legislation
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
or whether or not it may relate to an
 
04:50:50.690 --> 04:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
issue in your own in your own particular
 
04:50:54.708 --> 04:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
community so um with that I I think that
 
04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
sort of covers the who we are and what
 
04:50:59.510 --> 04:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
we do and why we're here and give you a
 
04:51:02.810 --> 04:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
little insight um as to who nhsba is and
 
04:51:04.670 --> 04:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
the positions we'll be taking why we'll
 
04:51:06.288 --> 04:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
be taking them and if there are any
 
04:51:08.330 --> 04:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
questions from from from the committee
 
04:51:10.190 --> 04:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly certainly happy to answer
 
04:51:11.690 --> 04:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
them but thank you for the opportunity
 
04:51:14.090 --> 04:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
chairman LED thank you very much are
 
04:51:15.650 --> 04:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
there any questions for the school board
 
04:51:18.530 --> 04:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
so yes representative Miler so so thank
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
you for being here thank you for taking
 
04:51:22.670 --> 04:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
my query
 
04:51:26.390 --> 04:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
just to be just to be clear your your
 
04:51:29.510 --> 04:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
organization is rep represents elected
 
04:51:32.810 --> 04:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
officials from local school boards
 
04:51:35.350 --> 04:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
that come together on an annual basis
 
04:51:38.750 --> 04:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
and establish the policy
 
04:51:41.810 --> 04:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
for the organization of which then you
 
04:51:45.470 --> 04:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
represent here uh when a bill comes up
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
Etc that is reflective of that elected
 
04:51:51.288 --> 04:51:51.298 align:start position:0%
body not your personal opinion but those
 
04:51:53.570 --> 04:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
from that elected body is that correct
 
04:51:54.708 --> 04:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:51:57.890 --> 04:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
representative Miler just to clarify we
 
04:52:00.050 --> 04:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
do not represent individuals
 
04:52:03.230 --> 04:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
like we represent the board as an entity
 
04:52:05.390 --> 04:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
so it's the board that's paying you know
 
04:52:07.850 --> 04:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
dues to the association not you know an
 
04:52:10.250 --> 04:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
individual School Board member
 
04:52:12.948 --> 04:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
um but yes the positions at nhsba takes
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
are um derivative from what our local
 
04:52:18.530 --> 04:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
school boards want they're either ones
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
who determine it's like I said it's like
 
04:52:22.190 --> 04:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
an annual meeting each School Board
 
04:52:25.128 --> 04:52:25.138 align:start position:0%
sends one voting delegate
 
04:52:27.470 --> 04:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
um we send out the the proposed
 
04:52:29.690 --> 04:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
resolutions weeks months ahead of time
 
04:52:32.090 --> 04:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
their local school board that makes a
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
decision of whether or not to support
 
04:52:35.690 --> 04:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
this proposal or not support this
 
04:52:38.330 --> 04:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
proposal their delegate comes and they
 
04:52:40.490 --> 04:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
they they carry the water for their
 
04:52:42.530 --> 04:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
local school board if you will but the
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
positions that are are in our our
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
resolutions are our handbook if you are
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
statement of beliefs are are determined
 
04:52:51.948 --> 04:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
by Our member school boards
 
04:52:54.288 --> 04:52:54.298 align:start position:0%
further questions yes going down the
 
04:52:56.030 --> 04:52:56.040 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman
 
04:53:09.900 --> 04:53:11.448 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman

um
 
04:53:14.030 --> 04:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
61 school boards and that's out of how
 
04:53:16.010 --> 04:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
many possibilities thank you for the
 
04:53:18.350 --> 04:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
question representative there are 176
 
04:53:20.510 --> 04:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
school districts in the state
 
04:53:22.910 --> 04:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
um of the 15 or so that are not members
 
04:53:24.530 --> 04:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
most of those are either school
 
04:53:26.750 --> 04:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
districts that don't operate a school we
 
04:53:28.910 --> 04:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
have some of those it's a small town of
 
04:53:30.410 --> 04:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
the mountains they've got maybe 30 kids
 
04:53:32.330 --> 04:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
they tuition them over the mountain
 
04:53:33.890 --> 04:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't make sense fiscally
 
04:53:36.050 --> 04:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
to maintain a school and then the other
 
04:53:37.250 --> 04:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
ones that are not members are again
 
04:53:40.250 --> 04:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
primarily some K through two k-4 type of
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
type of school districts where very very
 
04:53:44.448 --> 04:53:44.458 align:start position:0%
small student population in the school
 
04:53:45.948 --> 04:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
board does not have
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better phrase a ton of
 
04:53:47.760 --> 04:53:49.788 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better phrase a ton of
responsibility

04:53:49.788 --> 04:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:53:51.590 --> 04:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:53:53.810 --> 04:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
04:53:53.820 --> 04:53:54.770 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
chair

04:53:54.770 --> 04:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
um I believe I understand most of the
 
04:53:57.410 --> 04:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
stuff I've read in here but there's one
 
04:53:58.850 --> 04:53:58.860 align:start position:0%
thing that I'm not entirely clear on
 
04:54:00.948 --> 04:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
when it comes to continuing resolutions
 
04:54:04.490 --> 04:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
for 2022 item number seven on page two
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
NHS people advocate for legislative
 
04:54:08.390 --> 04:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
action that ensures local school boards
 
04:54:10.128 --> 04:54:10.138 align:start position:0%
comply with federal firearms laws and
 
04:54:10.138 --> 04:54:11.510 align:start position:0%
comply with federal firearms laws and
policies

04:54:11.510 --> 04:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
policies
 
04:54:13.010 --> 04:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I just I'm not actually sure what
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
that's refer but what exactly is
 
04:54:17.150 --> 04:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
referencing um so I'm not aware of like
 
04:54:18.410 --> 04:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
04:54:21.050 --> 04:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
Authority school boards may have when it
 
04:54:23.090 --> 04:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
comes to Firearms law sure certainly
 
04:54:25.190 --> 04:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
 
04:54:27.770 --> 04:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
um indeed under under state law school
 
04:54:29.208 --> 04:54:29.218 align:start position:0%
boards don't have any authority to
 
04:54:31.970 --> 04:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
regulate firearms on school grounds
 
04:54:31.980 --> 04:54:32.628 align:start position:0%
regulate firearms on school grounds
um

04:54:32.628 --> 04:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:35.330 --> 04:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
as a with respect to I'm just going to
 
04:54:37.128 --> 04:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
use the phrase adults there's a federal
 
04:54:39.350 --> 04:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
gun free school zones act that prohibits
 
04:54:43.310 --> 04:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
students and pupils from having guns on
 
04:54:46.430 --> 04:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
school grounds with some exceptions but
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
the federal law only applies to students
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
so the the I'd have to go back and check
 
04:54:54.170 --> 04:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
my notes as to the rationale as to why
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
this was put together
 
04:54:56.160 --> 04:54:58.570 align:start position:0%
this was put together
um

04:54:58.570 --> 04:54:58.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:02.030 --> 04:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
but I think it was a statement
 
04:55:02.040 --> 04:55:05.208 align:start position:0%
but I think it was a statement
um

04:55:05.208 --> 04:55:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:08.150 --> 04:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
firearm laws and policies I'd have to go
 
04:55:09.708 --> 04:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
back and check my notes represent I'll
 
04:55:11.570 --> 04:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
try and follow up with you but just so
 
04:55:13.010 --> 04:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
we're clear under state law right now
 
04:55:16.128 --> 04:55:16.138 align:start position:0%
school boards cannot regulate the sale
 
04:55:18.830 --> 04:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
possession use Etc firearms on school
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
grounds and nhsba by advises are members
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
of that despite me you advocate for them
 
04:55:25.730 --> 04:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
to be able to is that is that what I'm
 
04:55:27.530 --> 04:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm sorry but you were but you
 
04:55:29.570 --> 04:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
would uh Lobby for them to be able to is
 
04:55:31.550 --> 04:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
that what I'm we we do have a we do have
 
04:55:34.190 --> 04:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
another resolution it's in our statement
 
04:55:37.190 --> 04:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
of beliefs manual that nhsba supports
 
04:55:40.190 --> 04:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
limiting firearms possession to only law
 
04:55:42.050 --> 04:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers on school grounds
 
04:55:44.330 --> 04:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
we do have a position on on that topic
 
04:55:46.850 --> 04:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
as well too thank you yeah it says I
 
04:55:48.230 --> 04:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
forget exactly where it is but it'll be
 
04:55:51.530 --> 04:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
in the the preceding pages of that
 
04:55:53.690 --> 04:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
are there further questions to the
 
04:55:56.750 --> 04:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:59.090 --> 04:55:59.100 align:start position:0%

05:16:59.690 --> 05:16:59.700 align:start position:0%

lot of the legislative work that we do
 
05:17:09.410 --> 05:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
but as Barrett stated with the school
 
05:17:10.788 --> 05:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
boards Association really the
 
05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
legislative component is a very small
 
05:17:15.070 --> 05:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
piece of of our work
 
05:17:18.230 --> 05:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
our primary focus of work is
 
05:17:20.270 --> 05:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
professional development for systems
 
05:17:22.610 --> 05:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
leaders and in looking at the
 
05:17:24.770 --> 05:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
qualifications and the certification
 
05:17:26.690 --> 05:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
requirements of superintendents and
 
05:17:28.490 --> 05:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
business officials and special education
 
05:17:31.448 --> 05:17:31.458 align:start position:0%
directors and such we develop a
 
05:17:33.288 --> 05:17:33.298 align:start position:0%
professional development program
 
05:17:35.750 --> 05:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
annually that meets the certification
 
05:17:38.810 --> 05:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
needs of the individuals who sit in
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
those positions in your local school
 
05:17:43.550 --> 05:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
districts and that's part of the mission
 
05:17:45.770 --> 05:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
of our association is to provide high
 
05:17:47.390 --> 05:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
quality professional development so
 
05:17:50.448 --> 05:17:50.458 align:start position:0%
those folks can maintain their
 
05:17:50.458 --> 05:17:51.730 align:start position:0%
those folks can maintain their
certification

05:17:51.730 --> 05:17:51.740 align:start position:0%
certification
 
05:17:54.350 --> 05:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
we are Clearing House of information our
 
05:17:57.708 --> 05:17:57.718 align:start position:0%
five regions as I said meet um every
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
month and share great
 
05:18:04.448 --> 05:18:04.458 align:start position:0%
strategies and local information
 
05:18:06.830 --> 05:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
and really support one another we have
 
05:18:08.510 --> 05:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
great coalitions with a number of other
 
05:18:08.520 --> 05:18:11.090 align:start position:0%
great coalitions with a number of other
organizations

05:18:11.090 --> 05:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
05:18:13.788 --> 05:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
we feel very much that every child in
 
05:18:14.830 --> 05:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:18:17.448 --> 05:18:17.458 align:start position:0%
deserves the best that we can offer and
 
05:18:19.970 --> 05:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
we're better together and so we work
 
05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
really hard to try to share you know
 
05:18:24.590 --> 05:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
educators are the best pirates in
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
America because we steal from one
 
05:18:29.208 --> 05:18:29.218 align:start position:0%
another and we share and we are
 
05:18:32.990 --> 05:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
shamelessly giving of information if
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to help kids in a neighboring
 
05:18:37.730 --> 05:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
district and so that's part of what we
 
05:18:40.850 --> 05:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
do as well with the with the regional
 
05:18:42.770 --> 05:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
work curriculum instruction and
 
05:18:45.350 --> 05:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
assessment we have a whole arm of our
 
05:18:48.410 --> 05:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
organization that is meets regularly to
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
discuss issues of curriculum instruction
 
05:18:52.368 --> 05:18:52.378 align:start position:0%
and assessment those again our regional
 
05:18:55.070 --> 05:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
meetings and we have many curriculum
 
05:18:56.810 --> 05:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
instruction and assessment directors
 
05:18:58.970 --> 05:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
that are part of that group when this
 
05:19:01.070 --> 05:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
committee has questions about curriculum
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
or instruction we're happy to provide
 
05:19:05.208 --> 05:19:05.218 align:start position:0%
resources and information regarding that
 
05:19:06.650 --> 05:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
we try to bring in our curriculum
 
05:19:09.830 --> 05:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
experts as we can uh to you know they
 
05:19:13.550 --> 05:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
work too so we try to get them into to
 
05:19:16.490 --> 05:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
address any uh questions that folks may
 
05:19:19.128 --> 05:19:19.138 align:start position:0%
have around curriculum or assessment
 
05:19:21.410 --> 05:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
we work with communication we work with
 
05:19:23.628 --> 05:19:23.638 align:start position:0%
career counseling and job placement for
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
new and aspiring superintendents we have
 
05:19:27.670 --> 05:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
the granite state Leadership Academy
 
05:19:30.830 --> 05:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
that we have uh our we're on our seventh
 
05:19:33.948 --> 05:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
cohort of training tomorrow's systems
 
05:19:36.948 --> 05:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
leaders we hope uh tomorrow's systems
 
05:19:38.390 --> 05:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
leaders because we know that leadership
 
05:19:40.430 --> 05:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
is an important component of keeping our
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
schools in our communities high
 
05:19:46.910 --> 05:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
functioning and so we have uh about a
 
05:19:49.368 --> 05:19:49.378 align:start position:0%
hundred uh who we have trained in the
 
05:19:51.830 --> 05:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
past seven years we are on our seventh
 
05:19:54.830 --> 05:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
cohort and the the whole program of the
 
05:19:56.448 --> 05:19:56.458 align:start position:0%
Granite State Leadership Academy is
 
05:19:58.250 --> 05:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
designed around the competencies to be a
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools and you have
 
05:20:03.590 --> 05:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
in this packet the whole outline our
 
05:20:05.270 --> 05:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
Granite State Leadership Academy outline
 
05:20:07.490 --> 05:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
and the competencies and the various
 
05:20:10.190 --> 05:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
functions of really being certified as a
 
05:20:11.690 --> 05:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
superintendent and again I'm not going
 
05:20:14.590 --> 05:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
to take your time to go over those those
 
05:20:16.970 --> 05:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
specific pieces because I think that's
 
05:20:18.470 --> 05:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
just a lot
 
05:20:19.970 --> 05:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
we do have a number of recognition
 
05:20:23.090 --> 05:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
programs as I spoke to the Champions for
 
05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
Children piece the superintendent of the
 
05:20:27.830 --> 05:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
year which is a nationally run
 
05:20:31.070 --> 05:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
um program so New Hampshire has uh
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
annually a superintendent of the Year
 
05:20:36.410 --> 05:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
we're proud to announce it in 2023
 
05:20:39.830 --> 05:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
um Reuben Duncan from the Jackie Ridge
 
05:20:41.330 --> 05:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
District is our superintendent of the
 
05:20:43.850 --> 05:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
year most recently
 
05:20:46.970 --> 05:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
um Lisa Witt from the Monadnock District
 
05:20:49.190 --> 05:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
was the 2022 superintendent of the year
 
05:20:51.948 --> 05:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
we will on occasion bring those folks in
 
05:20:55.190 --> 05:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
to talk with you about any particular
 
05:20:57.230 --> 05:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
issues that you might want that level of
 
05:21:00.288 --> 05:21:00.298 align:start position:0%
of discussion on
 
05:21:00.298 --> 05:21:01.270 align:start position:0%
of discussion on
um

05:21:01.270 --> 05:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:04.250 --> 05:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
again we provide a great deal of
 
05:21:05.930 --> 05:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
professional development and
 
05:21:08.090 --> 05:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
opportunities to network share and build
 
05:21:08.100 --> 05:21:09.350 align:start position:0%
opportunities to network share and build
capacity

05:21:09.350 --> 05:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
05:21:11.570 --> 05:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
another round of our organization we
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
have Consulting Services we work with
 
05:21:16.368 --> 05:21:16.378 align:start position:0%
school districts and facility studies uh
 
05:21:18.288 --> 05:21:18.298 align:start position:0%
demographic studies special education
 
05:21:18.298 --> 05:21:19.730 align:start position:0%
demographic studies special education
studies

05:21:19.730 --> 05:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
studies
 
05:21:19.740 --> 05:21:20.510 align:start position:0%
studies
um

05:21:20.510 --> 05:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
we've done maintenance and operation
 
05:21:25.128 --> 05:21:25.138 align:start position:0%
studies but most recently we did some
 
05:21:26.750 --> 05:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
work with the Hampstead School District
 
05:21:30.128 --> 05:21:30.138 align:start position:0%
on a facility study but there are
 
05:21:32.690 --> 05:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
districts who we've worked with probably
 
05:21:35.330 --> 05:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
over the span of the association's time
 
05:21:37.310 --> 05:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
we worked with over half of the
 
05:21:40.550 --> 05:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
districts in we have a rich database of
 
05:21:43.070 --> 05:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
demographic information birth data
 
05:21:46.010 --> 05:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
housing data from all communities in the
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
state and it's provided some as a great
 
05:21:50.890 --> 05:21:50.900 align:start position:0%
resource for
 
05:21:53.690 --> 05:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
communities that are looking to do some
 
05:21:56.570 --> 05:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
facility changes or study enrollment
 
05:21:59.810 --> 05:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
Trends and that type of thing but we do
 
05:22:01.788 --> 05:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
05:22:01.798 --> 05:22:03.350 align:start position:0%
that as well
um

05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:04.970 --> 05:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
I'm going to come up for air for a
 
05:22:06.170 --> 05:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
minute and just ask if there are any
 
05:22:06.180 --> 05:22:08.390 align:start position:0%
minute and just ask if there are any
questions

05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:22:11.330 --> 05:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions of the
 
05:22:12.708 --> 05:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
superintendents Association
 
05:22:15.530 --> 05:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
administrators Association
 
05:22:18.590 --> 05:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you uh thank
 
05:22:20.330 --> 05:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
05:22:23.330 --> 05:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
um we had earlier this year
 
05:22:27.170 --> 05:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
a study committee on teacher shortage
 
05:22:30.170 --> 05:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
so my question I guess to you is what's
 
05:22:32.330 --> 05:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
the average 10-year
 
05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
of a superintendent
 
05:22:37.850 --> 05:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
and and uh what is the field team look
 
05:22:40.368 --> 05:22:40.378 align:start position:0%
like as far as availability of
 
05:22:42.470 --> 05:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
individuals to fill superintendent's
 
05:22:44.510 --> 05:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
positions across the state thank you for
 
05:22:45.948 --> 05:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
the question representative Milo I
 
05:22:48.288 --> 05:22:48.298 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question we did a study
 
05:22:51.708 --> 05:22:51.718 align:start position:0%
internally uh from our association to to
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
look at the New Hampshire superintendent
 
05:22:56.208 --> 05:22:56.218 align:start position:0%
because it it's different our New
 
05:22:57.890 --> 05:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire superintendents have a have a
 
05:23:00.350 --> 05:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
tendency to stay a bit longer than the
 
05:23:01.610 --> 05:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
national average
 
05:23:04.250 --> 05:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and so that's been a good thing as
 
05:23:06.590 --> 05:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
any of you who have been involved in the
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
change process knows that for Effective
 
05:23:10.610 --> 05:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
change to take place it takes three to
 
05:23:13.368 --> 05:23:13.378 align:start position:0%
five years for that process to happen in
 
05:23:15.050 --> 05:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
any school district and so it's
 
05:23:16.910 --> 05:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
difficult when you have top level
 
05:23:16.920 --> 05:23:18.830 align:start position:0%
difficult when you have top level
changes

05:23:18.830 --> 05:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
changes
 
05:23:21.708 --> 05:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
um on a regular basis and our study
 
05:23:23.330 --> 05:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
showed some interesting things and I
 
05:23:25.190 --> 05:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
apologize for not having the knowledge
 
05:23:26.930 --> 05:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
right at the top of my head we did
 
05:23:30.050 --> 05:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
provide uh the committee that took up
 
05:23:32.448 --> 05:23:32.458 align:start position:0%
this um issue with a copy of the report
 
05:23:37.610 --> 05:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
uh and the information but uh typically
 
05:23:39.530 --> 05:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say that
 
05:23:43.490 --> 05:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
um there was 17 districts in the state
 
05:23:45.530 --> 05:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
who have had the same superintendent
 
05:23:49.490 --> 05:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
since 2016-17.
 
05:23:53.628 --> 05:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:57.050 --> 05:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
I want to say a little over a dozen and
 
05:23:59.810 --> 05:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
I could be wrong so it's difficult uh
 
05:24:01.070 --> 05:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
that I've had more than one
 
05:24:04.250 --> 05:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
superintendent in five years
 
05:24:07.368 --> 05:24:07.378 align:start position:0%
um and actually it might be 17
 
05:24:08.990 --> 05:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think I have the numbers on it was 17
 
05:24:10.310 --> 05:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
that have had more than one
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent in five years and 30.
 
05:24:16.368 --> 05:24:16.378 align:start position:0%
actually had the same superintendent for
 
05:24:19.730 --> 05:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
since 2017 the rest have had
 
05:24:21.708 --> 05:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
um changes in one fashion or another
 
05:24:24.590 --> 05:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you follow it please yes uh yeah
 
05:24:26.448 --> 05:24:26.458 align:start position:0%
what are some of the issues other than
 
05:24:29.330 --> 05:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
covet what are some of the key issues
 
05:24:31.190 --> 05:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
that superintendents are facing right
 
05:24:32.270 --> 05:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
now as you've talked with your
 
05:24:32.280 --> 05:24:33.650 align:start position:0%
now as you've talked with your
colleagues

05:24:33.650 --> 05:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
05:24:35.868 --> 05:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I think one
 
05:24:37.310 --> 05:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
of the key issues that came back in our
 
05:24:40.550 --> 05:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
survey was work-life balance
 
05:24:42.770 --> 05:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
um the superintendents
 
05:24:45.470 --> 05:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
day is a long one especially when you
 
05:24:47.448 --> 05:24:47.458 align:start position:0%
have days like today
 
05:24:51.470 --> 05:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
um it started last night uh typically
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
It's Not Unusual to find superintendents
 
05:24:57.050 --> 05:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
on a on a and you have you have one in
 
05:24:58.430 --> 05:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
the house that you might be able to get
 
05:25:00.770 --> 05:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
some expert information out from at some
 
05:25:03.050 --> 05:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
point but it's it's not atypical to find
 
05:25:05.990 --> 05:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
superintendents uh you know on the phone
 
05:25:08.570 --> 05:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
at five o'clock in the evening the night
 
05:25:10.190 --> 05:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
before what is going to be a four
 
05:25:12.590 --> 05:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning decision
 
05:25:15.770 --> 05:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and so uh that that's but
 
05:25:17.510 --> 05:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
from my personal standpoint as a
 
05:25:18.530 --> 05:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
superintendent that was the worst part
 
05:25:20.930 --> 05:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
of my job the weather related decisions
 
05:25:22.670 --> 05:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
were the worst part of the job that's
 
05:25:24.650 --> 05:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
awful I don't care what anybody says
 
05:25:27.288 --> 05:25:27.298 align:start position:0%
it's awful because you can never make
 
05:25:28.550 --> 05:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
the right decision
 
05:25:30.890 --> 05:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
can never make the right decision
 
05:25:33.288 --> 05:25:33.298 align:start position:0%
um that said because if you don't have
 
05:25:35.208 --> 05:25:35.218 align:start position:0%
school there are kids who don't eat
 
05:25:36.650 --> 05:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
and some people may say that's a
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
no-brainer not to have school because
 
05:25:40.490 --> 05:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
it's not safe driving conditions but on
 
05:25:42.050 --> 05:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
a Friday if you don't have school there
 
05:25:43.250 --> 05:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
maybe kids are not going to eat until
 
05:25:43.260 --> 05:25:44.150 align:start position:0%
maybe kids are not going to eat until
Monday

05:25:44.150 --> 05:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
05:25:45.708 --> 05:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
so you have to think about those things
 
05:25:47.628 --> 05:25:47.638 align:start position:0%
and that's but anyway that's that's
 
05:25:49.788 --> 05:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
about a rabbit hole I'll get out
 
05:25:53.570 --> 05:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
um but the the number one uh issue that
 
05:25:55.310 --> 05:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
came out in our survey was the political
 
05:25:58.550 --> 05:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
climate the political climate both at
 
05:26:00.890 --> 05:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
the state level and the national level
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
and the local level and a lack of
 
05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
respect and regard for the decisions for
 
05:26:08.690 --> 05:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
the positions and for the work of the
 
05:26:10.930 --> 05:26:10.940 align:start position:0%
hard work of teachers that have gone
 
05:26:13.610 --> 05:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
unappreciated and under attack in many
 
05:26:16.970 --> 05:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
places and the superintendents and the
 
05:26:18.170 --> 05:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
administrators that are trying to
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
support those folks
 
05:26:24.230 --> 05:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
um in a variety of ways and the rest of
 
05:26:27.170 --> 05:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
the job hasn't changed the the emotional
 
05:26:30.110 --> 05:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
and social needs of the professionals
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
who we work with and the
 
05:26:33.230 --> 05:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals and the staffs that we
 
05:26:37.030 --> 05:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
work with have gained immensely and
 
05:26:39.708 --> 05:26:39.718 align:start position:0%
superintendents of people too they have
 
05:26:43.128 --> 05:26:43.138 align:start position:0%
families they they have a capacity and
 
05:26:45.350 --> 05:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
yet they're the leaders who are expected
 
05:26:48.650 --> 05:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
to provide the refueling of the tank
 
05:26:51.470 --> 05:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
for all of these to be effective to be
 
05:26:52.910 --> 05:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
effective they have to and they accept
 
05:26:57.050 --> 05:26:57.060 align:start position:0%
that responsibility boldly and
 
05:27:00.470 --> 05:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
and with pride but there's only so much
 
05:27:02.330 --> 05:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
in the tank before you start here on
 
05:27:03.650 --> 05:27:03.660 align:start position:0%
that you know tick tick tick and you
 
05:27:04.730 --> 05:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
wonder if you're going to make it to the
 
05:27:07.128 --> 05:27:07.138 align:start position:0%
next gas station or not uh and that's
 
05:27:09.050 --> 05:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
been a lot and and thank you for the
 
05:27:10.310 --> 05:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
question because that was really the
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
feedback that we got is that a lot of
 
05:27:13.970 --> 05:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
our superintendents are on the tick tick
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
tick and the last the very last school
 
05:27:17.040 --> 05:27:18.590 align:start position:0%
tick and the last the very last school
year

05:27:18.590 --> 05:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:27:22.550 --> 05:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
um 21-22 we average in the state about
 
05:27:26.330 --> 05:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
19 or 20. believe it or not turnovers of
 
05:27:28.970 --> 05:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
superintendents in a year and
 
05:27:33.830 --> 05:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
um a year ago that number was 28.
 
05:27:35.570 --> 05:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
and we're not talking about everyone
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
who's just at the retirement stage of
 
05:27:40.250 --> 05:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
things it's unfortunate we're losing
 
05:27:42.650 --> 05:27:42.660 align:start position:0%
some of the best brightest and um
 
05:27:45.110 --> 05:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
potentially most energetic leaders in
 
05:27:47.628 --> 05:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
our state because of of some of the
 
05:27:51.530 --> 05:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
political conditions thank you
 
05:27:52.730 --> 05:27:52.740 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire so there's a lot of local
 
05:28:59.868 --> 05:28:59.878 align:start position:0%
decision making uh we value that our
 
05:29:02.030 --> 05:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
association values that uh and
 
05:29:03.948 --> 05:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
apparently from uh the governor's
 
05:29:05.868 --> 05:29:05.878 align:start position:0%
inaugural address yesterday he values
 
05:29:10.190 --> 05:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
that local decision making so it's we do
 
05:29:12.650 --> 05:29:12.660 align:start position:0%
involve the castle program we don't
 
05:29:15.170 --> 05:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
endorse any particular program what we

members to learn about a variety of
 
05:29:24.288 --> 05:29:24.298 align:start position:0%
programs so that they can choose what's

best suited for their local community

role within their educational
 
05:32:01.490 --> 05:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
communities we also have a group of
 
05:32:03.770 --> 05:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
individuals who are leaders in our
 
05:32:05.868 --> 05:32:05.878 align:start position:0%
private special education schools that
 
05:32:08.750 --> 05:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
are approved by the department of Ed so
 
05:32:11.090 --> 05:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
we have a pretty diverse group of
 
05:32:14.510 --> 05:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
professionals within our organization
 
05:32:16.550 --> 05:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
um in terms of our priorities we kind of
 
05:32:19.250 --> 05:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
have three big areas very similar to
 
05:32:22.368 --> 05:32:22.378 align:start position:0%
that of the school administrators our
 
05:32:24.590 --> 05:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
first big priority area is around
 
05:32:27.650 --> 05:32:27.660 align:start position:0%
professional learning and similar to um
 
05:32:29.930 --> 05:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
the school administrators we do a lot of
 
05:32:33.470 --> 05:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
support with our members in terms of
 
05:32:35.390 --> 05:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
leadership development keeping them
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
current in terms of policy and law as
 
05:32:42.410 --> 05:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
well as keeping them up to date in the
 
05:32:43.570 --> 05:32:43.580 align:start position:0%
most current
 
05:32:46.368 --> 05:32:46.378 align:start position:0%
instructional and curriculum kinds of
 
05:32:48.530 --> 05:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
issues that we face in terms of meeting
 
05:32:53.150 --> 05:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
the needs of kids with exceptionalities
 
05:32:55.368 --> 05:32:55.378 align:start position:0%
um the second big bin in terms of our
 
05:32:57.770 --> 05:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
priorities is around communication and
 
05:33:00.230 --> 05:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and really focusing on
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
developing Partnerships with the
 
05:33:04.070 --> 05:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed with our advocacy
 
05:33:06.110 --> 05:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
groups with the other professional
 
05:33:09.410 --> 05:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
organizations ensuring that um they're
 
05:33:11.570 --> 05:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
aware of the importance of meeting the
 
05:33:13.368 --> 05:33:13.378 align:start position:0%
needs of the children and youth with
 
05:33:14.930 --> 05:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
exceptionalities that are in their
 
05:33:17.090 --> 05:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
school districts and then the third
 
05:33:21.230 --> 05:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
priority area for us is advocacy and
 
05:33:24.770 --> 05:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
legislation we're really following bills
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
that impact children and youth with
 
05:33:28.970 --> 05:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
disabilities and their and their
 
05:33:32.570 --> 05:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
families so we track and and really
 
05:33:35.628 --> 05:33:35.638 align:start position:0%
watch those kinds of bills in terms of
 
05:33:37.070 --> 05:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
that area
 
05:33:38.868 --> 05:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
when we think about our legislative
 
05:33:38.878 --> 05:33:40.610 align:start position:0%
when we think about our legislative
priorities

05:33:40.610 --> 05:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
05:33:42.948 --> 05:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
um we track bills that are coming
 
05:33:42.958 --> 05:33:44.390 align:start position:0%
um we track bills that are coming
forward

05:33:44.390 --> 05:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:33:46.310 --> 05:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and some and we try to really
 
05:33:49.788 --> 05:33:49.798 align:start position:0%
prioritize and our first area is around
 
05:33:52.430 --> 05:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
um high quality Educators
 
05:33:53.868 --> 05:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
um as you heard
 
05:33:56.810 --> 05:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
um teacher shortage is tremendous in the
 
05:33:59.390 --> 05:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
field of special education as is with
 
05:34:02.150 --> 05:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
special ed administrators we're seeing a
 
05:34:04.970 --> 05:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
real critical shortage in those areas
 
05:34:08.090 --> 05:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
and not a big pipeline of people going
 
05:34:10.850 --> 05:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
into the field so any bills or
 
05:34:13.730 --> 05:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
legislation related to promoting the
 
05:34:16.970 --> 05:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
high quality uh pipeline of Educators
 
05:34:20.570 --> 05:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
we're really focusing on that we're also
 
05:34:23.750 --> 05:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
focusing on finance and funding as you
 
05:34:25.788 --> 05:34:25.798 align:start position:0%
know that's a critical issue in the
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
field of special education so bills and
 
05:34:31.010 --> 05:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
legislations connected to finance and
 
05:34:32.690 --> 05:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
funding when it comes to special
 
05:34:32.700 --> 05:34:34.010 align:start position:0%
funding when it comes to special
education

05:34:34.010 --> 05:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:34:37.310 --> 05:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
we also focus on social and emotional
 
05:34:39.530 --> 05:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
Wellness wellness and safety of students
 
05:34:42.288 --> 05:34:42.298 align:start position:0%
especially those with exceptionalities
 
05:34:44.590 --> 05:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that they have high quality
 
05:34:48.110 --> 05:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services and a real
 
05:34:52.250 --> 05:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
coordinated set of care for those who
 
05:34:55.070 --> 05:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
might have significant Health needs so
 
05:34:57.050 --> 05:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
that's just kind of a snapshot of our
 
05:34:59.390 --> 05:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
organization our priorities as an
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
organization and legislatively what our
 
05:35:04.850 --> 05:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
legislative committee has identified as
 
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
priorities we've also put in your
 
05:35:10.128 --> 05:35:10.138 align:start position:0%
handout some facts about special
 
05:35:12.350 --> 05:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire that might be
 
05:35:15.890 --> 05:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
helpful to you as you talk about bills
 
05:35:17.868 --> 05:35:17.878 align:start position:0%
that are coming forward I'm going to ask
 
05:35:20.090 --> 05:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
Jen to cover some of that information
 
05:35:21.890 --> 05:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
with you
 
05:35:25.010 --> 05:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to begin on page two where
 
05:35:28.250 --> 05:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
um it says special education facts so
 
05:35:30.590 --> 05:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
our work is really um driven by the
 
05:35:33.470 --> 05:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
obligations of idea so as folks know
 
05:35:35.470 --> 05:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of legal responsibilities
 
05:35:38.990 --> 05:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
annually every state is um rated rated
 
05:35:40.490 --> 05:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
by the federal government
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and they call that the state
 
05:35:46.430 --> 05:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
performance plan so for the 2022 year I
 
05:35:48.110 --> 05:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
just wanted to share you with you folks
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
some things that we're pretty proud
 
05:35:52.788 --> 05:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
about we were ranked a number of New
 
05:35:55.128 --> 05:35:55.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's one of 22 states that met
 
05:35:57.610 --> 05:35:57.620 align:start position:0%
all the requirements of idea
 
05:36:00.530 --> 05:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
so there were no areas of concern we
 
05:36:02.390 --> 05:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
were number seven in the country as far
 
05:36:04.690 --> 05:36:04.700 align:start position:0%
as graduating students with disabilities
 
05:36:08.090 --> 05:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
number five as far as students who are
 
05:36:09.410 --> 05:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
dropping out
 
05:36:09.420 --> 05:36:10.250 align:start position:0%
dropping out
um

05:36:10.250 --> 05:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:12.470 --> 05:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
not number five in a positive way
 
05:36:14.990 --> 05:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
meaning we had a good no a very large
 
05:36:16.730 --> 05:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
number of students graduating who have
 
05:36:16.740 --> 05:36:18.230 align:start position:0%
number of students graduating who have
IEPs

05:36:18.230 --> 05:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
IEPs
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
um number three as far as post-school
 
05:36:22.190 --> 05:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
outcomes and enrollment and higher ed
 
05:36:23.570 --> 05:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
and number eight
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
um students being being competitively
 
05:36:28.610 --> 05:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
employed if you look to the right of the
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
page two you'll see that we've had a
 
05:36:32.090 --> 05:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
steady increase in the number of
 
05:36:36.350 --> 05:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
students with um IEPs in 2001 there are
 
05:36:38.990 --> 05:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
about 14.6 percent of our population was
 
05:36:42.410 --> 05:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
identified with an IEP in 2021 we're up
 
05:36:45.590 --> 05:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
to 17.9 percent nearly 18 percent of the
 
05:36:47.930 --> 05:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
entire population and I I'm sure that
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
covid played a role in that as well
 
05:36:50.638 --> 05:36:51.288 align:start position:0%
covid played a role in that as well
um

05:36:51.288 --> 05:36:51.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:53.570 --> 05:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
if you look on the bottom right
 
05:36:56.510 --> 05:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
um 79 of parents in New Hampshire with
 
05:36:57.890 --> 05:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
this of students with disabilities
 
05:36:59.570 --> 05:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
indicate that they're happy they've
 
05:37:02.390 --> 05:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
viewed special ed is favorable
 
05:37:04.430 --> 05:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
um and on the next page I'll talk a
 
05:37:09.170 --> 05:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
little bit about finances uh in 2020
 
05:37:11.810 --> 05:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
um there was a study done
 
05:37:15.590 --> 05:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
um by a committee on school funding and
 
05:37:17.948 --> 05:37:17.958 align:start position:0%
using a cost model predicting
 
05:37:21.170 --> 05:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
methodology they discovered that the
 
05:37:22.610 --> 05:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
average cost of a student with
 
05:37:24.708 --> 05:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
disabilities Falls between thirty
 
05:37:26.930 --> 05:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
thousand and forty five thousand per
 
05:37:26.940 --> 05:37:27.970 align:start position:0%
thousand and forty five thousand per
student

05:37:27.970 --> 05:37:27.980 align:start position:0%
student
 
05:37:30.410 --> 05:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
and that districts with larger
 
05:37:32.208 --> 05:37:32.218 align:start position:0%
percentages of disadvantaged students
 
05:37:34.128 --> 05:37:34.138 align:start position:0%
English Learners and special ed students
 
05:37:36.650 --> 05:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
perform worse on average in districts
 
05:37:38.868 --> 05:37:38.878 align:start position:0%
with fewer of students who have fewer
 
05:37:41.390 --> 05:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
needs so the complexities of a district
 
05:37:44.030 --> 05:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
plays a role obviously in how students
 
05:37:46.490 --> 05:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
perform and I won't read everything to
 
05:37:49.310 --> 05:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
you as far as a survey that gets done
 
05:37:52.310 --> 05:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
annually the department of Ed puts out a
 
05:37:55.070 --> 05:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
survey annually that asks parents about
 
05:37:58.550 --> 05:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
their experiences with special ed 80 or
 
05:38:00.288 --> 05:38:00.298 align:start position:0%
more reported feeling they have good
 
05:38:02.270 --> 05:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
communication being that they're
 
05:38:03.948 --> 05:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
meaningfully included and that they feel
 
05:38:06.530 --> 05:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
an equal member of the IEP team
 
05:38:08.090 --> 05:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
if you get if you look at the federal
 
05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
funds we get State funds obviously and
 
05:38:14.030 --> 05:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
then we get federal funds so the federal
 
05:38:16.910 --> 05:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
funds come as part of the idea Grant and
 
05:38:18.470 --> 05:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you can see the chart
 
05:38:20.830 --> 05:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
that I have in front of you
 
05:38:25.490 --> 05:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 22 the state received 53
 
05:38:28.368 --> 05:38:28.378 align:start position:0%
million and that Federal flow through
 
05:38:29.930 --> 05:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
money that actually went to districts
 
05:38:32.530 --> 05:38:32.540 align:start position:0%
and leas was 45-9
 
05:38:36.170 --> 05:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
a 20 increase was made in the amount of
 
05:38:39.530 --> 05:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
money the state received in FY 23 so the
 
05:38:42.230 --> 05:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
state receives 64 million which was a 10
 
05:38:45.288 --> 05:38:45.298 align:start position:0%
10.8 million increase while the
 
05:38:48.350 --> 05:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
district's only uh earned an additional
 
05:38:51.050 --> 05:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
1 million so I you know we struggle with
 
05:38:53.390 --> 05:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
what's sometimes you know whether in
 
05:38:54.830 --> 05:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
some states the federal flow through
 
05:38:57.010 --> 05:38:57.020 align:start position:0%
money goes to the districts
 
05:38:59.330 --> 05:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
entirely so
 
05:39:01.730 --> 05:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
um it's a moving Target for us and when
 
05:39:03.890 --> 05:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
we try to budget it's hard to know um
 
05:39:06.050 --> 05:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
you know what level of funding so we're
 
05:39:09.110 --> 05:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
seeing increases overall in many cases a
 
05:39:13.788 --> 05:39:13.798 align:start position:0%
a federal funding special ed Aid was
 
05:39:16.190 --> 05:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
formerly called catastrophic Aid so
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's for students with really
 
05:39:20.690 --> 05:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
exceptional needs so you can see back as
 
05:39:24.050 --> 05:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
far as 1998 we were receiving about 39
 
05:39:27.170 --> 05:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
million in funding through that for
 
05:39:29.810 --> 05:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 we're down to 29 million
 
05:39:34.850 --> 05:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
so as costs continue to rise we struggle
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
more and more in meeting the needs of
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
students and I think I point out we
 
05:39:41.930 --> 05:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
pointed out here in the bottom right the
 
05:39:45.170 --> 05:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
doe does race setting for private
 
05:39:47.868 --> 05:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
schools and so typically those rates
 
05:39:50.090 --> 05:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
were set pretty pretty strict for and
 
05:39:53.270 --> 05:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
firm for many years about five years ago
 
05:39:55.550 --> 05:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
this does started increasing the rates
 
05:39:58.490 --> 05:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
at a five percent rate annually and that
 
05:40:00.350 --> 05:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
compounds as you can imagine our most
 
05:40:02.810 --> 05:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
dis our most expensive placement for one
 
05:40:06.050 --> 05:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
student went from will go from 140 000
 
05:40:10.250 --> 05:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
this year year 247 000 next year so
 
05:40:13.010 --> 05:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
those are challenging costs to keep up
 
05:40:14.990 --> 05:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
with when our budgets you know typically
 
05:40:17.390 --> 05:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
don't go up five percent
 
05:40:17.400 --> 05:40:18.170 align:start position:0%
don't go up five percent
um

05:40:18.170 --> 05:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:20.810 --> 05:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
just uh you know just some I think
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to present I think you
 
05:40:24.830 --> 05:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
know the association is a non-profit
 
05:40:26.930 --> 05:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
Professional Organization and I think
 
05:40:28.550 --> 05:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
Jane mentioned what we're committed to
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
who are voice for equity and Excellence
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
for students with disabilities thank you
 
05:40:37.490 --> 05:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh our uh represent Allison thank you Mr
 
05:40:40.670 --> 05:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
chairman just a clarification on the uh
 
05:40:43.430 --> 05:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
would be the third page of the fact
 
05:40:46.850 --> 05:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
sheet under federal funds uh employee 23
 
05:40:48.708 --> 05:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
where you talked about the state
 
05:40:51.650 --> 05:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
received 64 million in school districts
 
05:40:55.190 --> 05:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
received 47 million can you tell us
 
05:40:57.948 --> 05:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
where the other 17 million went
 
05:41:00.948 --> 05:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
no we can't tell you that we don't know
 
05:41:02.570 --> 05:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
um that's the so the federal flow
 
05:41:04.310 --> 05:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
through money goes to the Department of
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
Ed and then the department of Ed
 
05:41:08.208 --> 05:41:08.218 align:start position:0%
distributes in many states the federal
 
05:41:10.250 --> 05:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
flow through money goes all to districts
 
05:41:12.770 --> 05:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
right there is a set aside states can
 
05:41:15.110 --> 05:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
make but it's a minimal amount we don't
 
05:41:16.970 --> 05:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
have the answers to that and we share
 
05:41:19.010 --> 05:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
that in the hopes of sort of figuring
 
05:41:20.510 --> 05:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
that out and
 
05:41:22.430 --> 05:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
um so I don't have an answer for you
 
05:41:22.440 --> 05:41:23.208 align:start position:0%
um so I don't have an answer for you
okay

05:41:23.208 --> 05:41:23.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:41:25.190 --> 05:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and I think
 
05:41:27.530 --> 05:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
we know some of the money
 
05:41:29.750 --> 05:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
um The Bureau administrator shares
 
05:41:32.330 --> 05:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
openly that that most of the Consultants
 
05:41:35.208 --> 05:41:35.218 align:start position:0%
within the bureau are funded out of idea
 
05:41:38.150 --> 05:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
monies they're not um they're not state
 
05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
employees they're not paid by the state
 
05:41:43.670 --> 05:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
so a good chunk of the money goes to
 
05:41:45.830 --> 05:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
that they use some of the money for
 
05:41:48.230 --> 05:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
professional learning
 
05:41:50.390 --> 05:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
um and I believe they use some of the
 
05:41:53.990 --> 05:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
money to pay rent for their Bureau space
 
05:41:56.990 --> 05:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
within the department of Ed facility but
 
05:41:59.448 --> 05:41:59.458 align:start position:0%
beyond that not quite sure that that
 
05:42:01.550 --> 05:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
does definitely does not cover all of
 
05:42:03.948 --> 05:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
the money I think even when they were in
 
05:42:05.690 --> 05:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed um
 
05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
in the last location they were paying
 
05:42:10.190 --> 05:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
rent to that to that building with the
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
federal flow through money oh follow-up
 
05:42:15.170 --> 05:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
yes uh would it be helpful for you to
 
05:42:17.448 --> 05:42:17.458 align:start position:0%
know if we could get some accounting for
 
05:42:19.490 --> 05:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
the 17 million that would that'd be
 
05:42:21.410 --> 05:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
05:42:23.750 --> 05:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
for the questions yes representative
 
05:42:26.208 --> 05:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
Cornell thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:42:28.070 --> 05:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question you said there's an
 
05:42:30.410 --> 05:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
increase in students being identified
 
05:42:34.510 --> 05:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
with a disability is there any special
 
05:42:37.850 --> 05:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
disability that is increasing or do you
 
05:42:40.730 --> 05:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
notice anyone more than another
 
05:42:43.010 --> 05:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
I don't go ahead Jane thank you for the
 
05:42:44.750 --> 05:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
question we we have looked at some of
 
05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
the information we're seeing a huge
 
05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
number of increase in very young
 
05:42:51.650 --> 05:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
children being identified with very
 
05:42:53.990 --> 05:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
significant and unique complex
 
05:42:56.470 --> 05:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities ranging from
 
05:43:00.788 --> 05:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
autism to very unique medical issues
 
05:43:03.530 --> 05:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
we're seeing an increase when you look
 
05:43:06.470 --> 05:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
at the numbers in autism also
 
05:43:08.510 --> 05:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
um so I think those are two areas and
 
05:43:10.128 --> 05:43:10.138 align:start position:0%
Jen you probably can speak a little bit
 
05:43:13.070 --> 05:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
more I think we're while you may not see
 
05:43:15.670 --> 05:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
it in the data we're seeing a lot more
 
05:43:17.930 --> 05:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
students experiencing mental health
 
05:43:20.810 --> 05:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
issues that's gone up significantly
 
05:43:22.368 --> 05:43:22.378 align:start position:0%
um and I you know some of that may be
 
05:43:24.590 --> 05:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
due to learning loss it's hard to tease
 
05:43:27.288 --> 05:43:27.298 align:start position:0%
out what's what when um students you
 
05:43:28.430 --> 05:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
know we're out of school for a period
 
05:43:32.650 --> 05:43:32.660 align:start position:0%
but overall the population has increased
 
05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to make a comment uh in
 
05:43:38.330 --> 05:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
talking to the superintendent of schools
 
05:43:41.208 --> 05:43:41.218 align:start position:0%
in the town that I live in up in SAU 23
 
05:43:43.850 --> 05:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
that Laurie Melanson I asked you the
 
05:43:46.270 --> 05:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
question where is she seeing the
 
05:43:49.010 --> 05:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
increases or the spikes in special
 
05:43:49.020 --> 05:43:50.270 align:start position:0%
increases or the spikes in special
education

05:43:50.270 --> 05:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:43:54.048 --> 05:43:54.058 align:start position:0%
and of the 13 IEP categories she said
 
05:43:57.890 --> 05:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
other health impaired is jumping on us
 
05:44:01.368 --> 05:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
now I would assume then and perhaps you
 
05:44:02.990 --> 05:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
might be able to help me out would that
 
05:44:06.948 --> 05:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
be a result of the covet era and the
 
05:44:09.890 --> 05:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
mental issues or the home life issues
 
05:44:12.470 --> 05:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
and all that's associated with kids who
 
05:44:15.230 --> 05:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
are coming into school yeah Ohi is for
 
05:44:17.810 --> 05:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
other health impaired so that can many
 
05:44:19.970 --> 05:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
different disabilities fall into that
 
05:44:22.128 --> 05:44:22.138 align:start position:0%
attention deficit mental health issues
 
05:44:24.410 --> 05:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
if a student doesn't rise to the level
 
05:44:26.628 --> 05:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
of being identified emotionally
 
05:44:28.970 --> 05:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
handicapped people you know teams will
 
05:44:32.448 --> 05:44:32.458 align:start position:0%
use Ohi so that that makes sense I think
 
05:44:34.250 --> 05:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
your your understanding
 
05:44:36.470 --> 05:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
um it captures so many different areas
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
of need
 
05:44:37.920 --> 05:44:38.570 align:start position:0%
of need
um

05:44:38.570 --> 05:44:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:41.628 --> 05:44:41.638 align:start position:0%
whereas the other 13 areas of disability
 
05:44:44.750 --> 05:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
are very defined yes thank you Valerie
 
05:44:44.760 --> 05:44:46.310 align:start position:0%
are very defined yes thank you Valerie
now

05:44:46.310 --> 05:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:44:48.530 --> 05:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
yes represent McDonald thank you Mr
 
05:44:50.030 --> 05:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking the
 
05:44:52.310 --> 05:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
question how much of this increase can
 
05:44:55.190 --> 05:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
be attributed to an increased ability to
 
05:44:57.170 --> 05:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
identify and diagnose these disorders
 
05:44:59.570 --> 05:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
whereas opposed to an increase in the
 
05:45:02.628 --> 05:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:04.310 --> 05:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
we thank you for the question I don't
 
05:45:05.990 --> 05:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
have the answer to that
 
05:45:06.000 --> 05:45:06.650 align:start position:0%
have the answer to that
um

05:45:06.650 --> 05:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:08.750 --> 05:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
I I really don't know I think you know
 
05:45:10.970 --> 05:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
practices regarding evaluation and
 
05:45:12.470 --> 05:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
identification haven't changed
 
05:45:14.930 --> 05:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
significantly I think there's
 
05:45:16.970 --> 05:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
um there's been a lot that's gone on in
 
05:45:18.770 --> 05:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years
 
05:45:22.070 --> 05:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
um that has contributed I think to those
 
05:45:22.080 --> 05:45:23.390 align:start position:0%
um that has contributed I think to those
numbers

05:45:23.390 --> 05:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
05:45:25.910 --> 05:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would expand on that you
 
05:45:27.890 --> 05:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
know there's there's real set criteria
 
05:45:30.048 --> 05:45:30.058 align:start position:0%
for the types of evaluations that need
 
05:45:31.730 --> 05:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
to be done in the and the way the
 
05:45:33.590 --> 05:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
decisions are made so that hasn't
 
05:45:35.930 --> 05:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
changed in fact we're we're actually
 
05:45:38.628 --> 05:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
lacking in terms of school psychologists
 
05:45:40.610 --> 05:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
we can't get them we can't get speech
 
05:45:40.620 --> 05:45:42.230 align:start position:0%
we can't get them we can't get speech
pathologists

05:45:42.230 --> 05:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
pathologists
 
05:45:45.048 --> 05:45:45.058 align:start position:0%
um so even getting evaluations done is
 
05:45:48.170 --> 05:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
is a significant challenge
 
05:45:50.030 --> 05:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
05:45:52.310 --> 05:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
thanks chairman good afternoon and
 
05:45:55.610 --> 05:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
welcome ladies uh during generally
 
05:45:58.310 --> 05:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
during covid when many of the youngsters
 
05:46:00.708 --> 05:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
were at home I mean the school systems
 
05:46:02.690 --> 05:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
are closed down permanently for
 
05:46:05.810 --> 05:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
in-person contact uh how are special
 
05:46:08.150 --> 05:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
services typically provided
 
05:46:10.070 --> 05:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
no I can answer that yeah thank you for
 
05:46:11.330 --> 05:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
the question
 
05:46:15.170 --> 05:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
um we were fully staffed and worked
 
05:46:17.448 --> 05:46:17.458 align:start position:0%
remotely with all of our students all of
 
05:46:18.890 --> 05:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
the students with disabilities were
 
05:46:20.270 --> 05:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
either included in the General Ed
 
05:46:22.548 --> 05:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
setting meaning they were taking part in
 
05:46:23.930 --> 05:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
the remote learning that was going on
 
05:46:26.090 --> 05:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
with all students we also had our
 
05:46:28.990 --> 05:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
therapists online providing therapies
 
05:46:31.850 --> 05:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
and teachers providing direct
 
05:46:34.430 --> 05:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
instruction when needed so it was a it
 
05:46:35.770 --> 05:46:35.780 align:start position:0%
was a busy time
 
05:46:38.570 --> 05:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
and I think folks did the best they
 
05:46:41.150 --> 05:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
could do we brought students back in as
 
05:46:43.250 --> 05:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
soon as we could we brought students
 
05:46:45.770 --> 05:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
with disabilities back in first
 
05:46:45.780 --> 05:46:46.430 align:start position:0%
with disabilities back in first
um

05:46:46.430 --> 05:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:49.190 --> 05:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
so it was challenging but I think folks
 
05:46:50.510 --> 05:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know worked very closely with
 
05:46:52.368 --> 05:46:52.378 align:start position:0%
students and tried to keep in touch with
 
05:46:57.470 --> 05:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:00.650 --> 05:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
the Father the students that had
 
05:47:04.310 --> 05:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
um PT or OT issues was a scene where
 
05:47:07.010 --> 05:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
those uh therapists going to the home or
 
05:47:08.990 --> 05:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
is it did that occur pretty much
 
05:47:10.970 --> 05:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
throughout the state it occurred with
 
05:47:12.650 --> 05:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
students we got a few students we did
 
05:47:14.090 --> 05:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
that with because they were you know
 
05:47:16.070 --> 05:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
they need was such
 
05:47:18.350 --> 05:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
um for the for some students they just
 
05:47:20.990 --> 05:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh the therapists would work with
 
05:47:23.330 --> 05:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
parents online to have them you know
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
have the students doing certain
 
05:47:27.530 --> 05:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
activities and so forth but on on
 
05:47:29.810 --> 05:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
special Circ in special circumstances we
 
05:47:32.030 --> 05:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
did permit um folks to go into the homes
 
05:47:33.350 --> 05:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
and do things
 
05:47:37.090 --> 05:47:37.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair yes
 
05:47:39.410 --> 05:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
05:47:40.788 --> 05:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
um over the years at town meeting a lot
 
05:47:45.230 --> 05:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
of numbers have been floated uh about
 
05:47:47.390 --> 05:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
what a percentage of federal obligation
 
05:47:49.128 --> 05:47:49.138 align:start position:0%
is for special education costs versus
 
05:47:51.530 --> 05:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
State ones and I know that a lot of
 
05:47:52.970 --> 05:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
money has come through the pipelines in
 
05:47:54.530 --> 05:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years and things are
 
05:47:58.190 --> 05:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
are a little bit different but are is
 
05:48:00.170 --> 05:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
the federal government meeting its
 
05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
obligations its statutory obligations or
 
05:48:04.670 --> 05:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
are we getting unfunded mandates passed
 
05:48:06.070 --> 05:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
down tests
 
05:48:07.930 --> 05:48:07.940 align:start position:0%
her doctor
 
05:48:10.368 --> 05:48:10.378 align:start position:0%
the federal government has never really
 
05:48:12.110 --> 05:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
met the obligation I think there's
 
05:48:14.930 --> 05:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
discussion about improving on uh what
 
05:48:16.670 --> 05:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
they're providing this coming fiscal
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
year but no I think it's um yeah it's
 
05:48:21.650 --> 05:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
pretty well known that it's not benefit
 
05:48:25.010 --> 05:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
funded fully okay thank you very much so
 
05:48:26.868 --> 05:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
the figure used to be they promised us
 
05:48:28.430 --> 05:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
40 percent
 
05:48:33.170 --> 05:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
what is it 17 16 where are we now I
 
05:48:34.548 --> 05:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
think it's it's somewhere around there
 
05:48:36.530 --> 05:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
and it's ridiculous yeah what's
 
05:48:38.150 --> 05:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
happening I have a question for you
 
05:48:40.690 --> 05:48:40.700 align:start position:0%
though uh back in
 
05:48:43.970 --> 05:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
2009 when I came this joint we had about
 
05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
210 000 kids in school and roughly
 
05:48:50.090 --> 05:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
around 29 30 000 kids identified with an
 
05:48:50.100 --> 05:48:51.288 align:start position:0%
around 29 30 000 kids identified with an
IEP

05:48:51.288 --> 05:48:51.298 align:start position:0%
IEP
 
05:48:54.110 --> 05:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
that is the case again today we have
 
05:48:55.970 --> 05:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
about 30 000 kids
 
05:48:59.810 --> 05:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
and about 164 161 and somewhere the
 
05:49:02.628 --> 05:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
Thousand kids so obviously we're having
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
more percentage-wise they're in special
 
05:49:08.570 --> 05:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
ed right now and my other concern is you
 
05:49:10.190 --> 05:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
know I'd like to know that's just not a
 
05:49:12.670 --> 05:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
trend resulting from just covet either
 
05:49:16.010 --> 05:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh it was identified prior to that but
 
05:49:19.250 --> 05:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'm also concerned Why are two-thirds of
 
05:49:22.970 --> 05:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
the kids that have IEPs males
 
05:49:25.070 --> 05:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
well to enter the first party or to
 
05:49:26.570 --> 05:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
respond to your the first part of your
 
05:49:26.580 --> 05:49:27.890 align:start position:0%
respond to your the first part of your
question

05:49:27.890 --> 05:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:49:27.900 --> 05:49:29.750 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:49:29.750 --> 05:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:32.330 --> 05:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
I I don't know why they're males I do
 
05:49:34.490 --> 05:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
think that there's some research uh I
 
05:49:35.448 --> 05:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
don't think that I don't even know if
 
05:49:37.310 --> 05:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's two-thirds I'd have to double check
 
05:49:39.048 --> 05:49:39.058 align:start position:0%
on that that's the figures which I saw
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
on the sheets that come out of doe so
 
05:49:43.730 --> 05:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
the but the first part of this were you
 
05:49:45.288 --> 05:49:45.298 align:start position:0%
talking about public school students
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
because we are we're responsible for the
 
05:49:50.150 --> 05:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
public schools it went from 210 000
 
05:49:52.670 --> 05:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
we're down about 100. we have identified
 
05:49:55.010 --> 05:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
students that we care for in the private
 
05:49:57.410 --> 05:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
schools and the charter schools as well
 
05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
so um that might be why that number
 
05:50:02.628 --> 05:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed so as the population of
 
05:50:04.548 --> 05:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
the public school students decreases and
 
05:50:06.230 --> 05:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
we continue to service students with
 
05:50:08.868 --> 05:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
disabilities in all these locations
 
05:50:11.810 --> 05:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
um that will stay the same and it's a
 
05:50:13.490 --> 05:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
great question on the on the males and
 
05:50:16.128 --> 05:50:16.138 align:start position:0%
we'll look into that
 
05:50:18.110 --> 05:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
I've asked my daughter that she's a
 
05:50:20.090 --> 05:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
speech pathologist for their C's and all
 
05:50:23.330 --> 05:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
that and it seems to be at the younger
 
05:50:23.340 --> 05:50:24.530 align:start position:0%
that and it seems to be at the younger
grades

05:50:24.530 --> 05:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
grades
 
05:50:27.890 --> 05:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
there's more mail than there is female
 
05:50:30.350 --> 05:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
is that result of Readiness I don't know
 
05:50:32.750 --> 05:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
is that a result of some other issue I
 
05:50:34.548 --> 05:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
05:50:38.030 --> 05:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
but something that I observe and I could
 
05:50:40.070 --> 05:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
never figure it out
 
05:50:43.150 --> 05:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
we'll look into that yes representative
 
05:50:45.530 --> 05:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and just to kind
 
05:50:47.930 --> 05:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
of follow up on on your question
 
05:50:47.940 --> 05:50:48.650 align:start position:0%
of follow up on on your question
um

05:50:48.650 --> 05:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:50.690 --> 05:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
so we don't we don't test everybody for
 
05:50:51.948 --> 05:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
Cancer all the time because we're
 
05:50:53.930 --> 05:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
constantly producing cancer cells and we
 
05:50:55.250 --> 05:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
would have false positives all over the
 
05:50:56.390 --> 05:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
place and we wind up giving people
 
05:50:57.830 --> 05:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy you don't necessarily need
 
05:51:00.350 --> 05:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
it so I guess my question is are we
 
05:51:02.090 --> 05:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
casting a wide net doing any sort of
 
05:51:04.010 --> 05:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
universal testing within within schools
 
05:51:05.448 --> 05:51:05.458 align:start position:0%
on these kids
 
05:51:07.490 --> 05:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
um that might be rounding up
 
05:51:10.430 --> 05:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
sort of so wild cases yeah we don't test
 
05:51:12.770 --> 05:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
we don't test all students and we only
 
05:51:14.628 --> 05:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
test students when there's a referral
 
05:51:16.548 --> 05:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
made so the referral has to come from a
 
05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
physician a parent or a classroom
 
05:51:18.958 --> 05:51:20.270 align:start position:0%
physician a parent or a classroom
teacher

05:51:20.270 --> 05:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
05:51:20.280 --> 05:51:21.170 align:start position:0%
teacher
um

05:51:21.170 --> 05:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:23.030 --> 05:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
so I you know I don't think we're
 
05:51:24.770 --> 05:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
testing I think we're testing by
 
05:51:27.110 --> 05:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
obligation when we have to
 
05:51:29.150 --> 05:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
um and not all of those referrals result
 
05:51:31.070 --> 05:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
in identification there really is
 
05:51:33.770 --> 05:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
criteria that students have to meet uh
 
05:51:35.510 --> 05:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for special education
 
05:51:38.570 --> 05:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
services thank you
 
05:51:41.270 --> 05:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
I would just expand on that just to say
 
05:51:44.090 --> 05:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire schools are mandated to
 
05:51:46.670 --> 05:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
have multi-tiered systems of support in
 
05:51:49.670 --> 05:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
hopes that that will reduce the number
 
05:51:51.948 --> 05:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
of referrals being made to special
 
05:51:54.590 --> 05:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
education and that we can meet the needs
 
05:51:57.708 --> 05:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
of more students in in our tier one and
 
05:52:00.170 --> 05:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
tier two before they get to a special ed
 
05:52:03.470 --> 05:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
referral representative
 
05:52:06.110 --> 05:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
now thank you Mr chairman since the
 
05:52:08.628 --> 05:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
issue of federal funds have come up for
 
05:52:10.670 --> 05:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
the edification of the new members of
 
05:52:12.350 --> 05:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:52:14.628 --> 05:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Education is
 
05:52:16.368 --> 05:52:16.378 align:start position:0%
basically funded
 
05:52:18.230 --> 05:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
Personnel in the department of education
 
05:52:20.868 --> 05:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
is basically funded through what 84 85
 
05:52:24.288 --> 05:52:24.298 align:start position:0%
80 plus 85 percent of federal funds yeah
 
05:52:27.048 --> 05:52:27.058 align:start position:0%
so the so the department
 
05:52:29.090 --> 05:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
is really
 
05:52:33.590 --> 05:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
strapped frankly to provide services to
 
05:52:36.110 --> 05:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
school districts because the the state
 
05:52:38.030 --> 05:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
does not really fund those positions
 
05:52:39.948 --> 05:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
they're funded through Federal projects
 
05:52:41.628 --> 05:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
Etc so I just thought it would be
 
05:52:43.368 --> 05:52:43.378 align:start position:0%
important for you to know that for the
 
05:52:45.650 --> 05:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
money is coming from to fund those
 
05:52:48.368 --> 05:52:48.378 align:start position:0%
positions in the department
 
05:52:52.788 --> 05:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
yes representative Balboni thank you Mr
 
05:52:52.798 --> 05:52:53.690 align:start position:0%
yes representative Balboni thank you Mr
chair

05:52:53.690 --> 05:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:52:55.610 --> 05:52:55.620 align:start position:0%
um I have a question regarding how um
 
05:52:57.890 --> 05:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
special education services are provided
 
05:53:00.170 --> 05:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
at private institutions especially in
 
05:53:04.430 --> 05:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
regard to the New Freedom accounts
 
05:53:05.810 --> 05:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
great question
 
05:53:08.208 --> 05:53:08.218 align:start position:0%
um so it depends on what's sort of the
 
05:53:09.830 --> 05:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
students going to a private school that
 
05:53:12.048 --> 05:53:12.058 align:start position:0%
the parents place them in it's parental
 
05:53:13.190 --> 05:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:53:16.070 --> 05:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
um we provide we we offer Faith which
 
05:53:18.170 --> 05:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
means we offer a full IEP in the General
 
05:53:20.270 --> 05:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
Ed setting and if the parent doesn't
 
05:53:22.610 --> 05:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
want that they are eligible to receive
 
05:53:24.530 --> 05:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
some of the federal flow through funds
 
05:53:26.810 --> 05:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
and so the special ed directors in each
 
05:53:28.430 --> 05:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
district meet
 
05:53:30.770 --> 05:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
um with the the directors of all of
 
05:53:33.230 --> 05:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
these schools and talk about how they
 
05:53:35.330 --> 05:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
want to spend that that money that is
 
05:53:37.970 --> 05:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
allocated for those students for Charter
 
05:53:40.010 --> 05:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
students placed in charter schools we're
 
05:53:42.410 --> 05:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
fully responsible for all of the
 
05:53:44.930 --> 05:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
programming from identification to IEP
 
05:53:47.930 --> 05:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
writing to accommodations modifications
 
05:53:49.970 --> 05:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
goals everything
 
05:53:53.150 --> 05:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
um so it's it it differs a little bit
 
05:53:56.448 --> 05:53:56.458 align:start position:0%
uh just a follow-up Please Mr chair
 
05:53:58.430 --> 05:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
um so in the charter schools you provide
 
05:54:00.170 --> 05:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
the services directly in the charter
 
05:54:02.090 --> 05:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
schools there are personal if they are
 
05:54:04.788 --> 05:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
yes we either send people in or we
 
05:54:08.150 --> 05:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
contract with agencies or we we pay the
 
05:54:10.010 --> 05:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
charter schools to provide the services
 
05:54:13.070 --> 05:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you there is a list of the
 
05:54:14.868 --> 05:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
options available in statute they can
 
05:54:17.990 --> 05:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
also send to the sending the the sending
 
05:54:20.510 --> 05:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
school to provide the service there
 
05:54:20.520 --> 05:54:22.910 align:start position:0%
school to provide the service there
yeah

05:54:22.910 --> 05:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:54:26.270 --> 05:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:28.128 --> 05:54:28.138 align:start position:0%
represent Lucas
 
05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
I was waiting for the last of her
 
05:54:30.718 --> 05:54:32.270 align:start position:0%
I was waiting for the last of her
questions

05:54:32.270 --> 05:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:54:34.670 --> 05:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
um and what do you do as far as kids who
 
05:54:38.208 --> 05:54:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:40.430 --> 05:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
um so that's considered again that's
 
05:54:42.830 --> 05:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
parentally placed meaning that they
 
05:54:44.990 --> 05:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
would be eligible
 
05:54:47.090 --> 05:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
they really wouldn't be eligible
 
05:54:47.100 --> 05:54:47.690 align:start position:0%
they really wouldn't be eligible
um

05:54:47.690 --> 05:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:49.368 --> 05:54:49.378 align:start position:0%
well they would be eligible if the
 
05:54:50.690 --> 05:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
school that they're attending is a
 
05:54:53.510 --> 05:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
non-profit but if it's not if it's a
 
05:54:55.128 --> 05:54:55.138 align:start position:0%
for-profit school I don't believe the
 
05:54:58.430 --> 05:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
doe allocates funding to that to those
 
05:55:00.650 --> 05:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
so if they were in a
 
05:55:04.128 --> 05:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
you know if they were in a a school in
 
05:55:05.990 --> 05:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
in your district and it was a non-profit
 
05:55:07.490 --> 05:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be eligible to receive
 
05:55:13.190 --> 05:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:16.250 --> 05:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
further further questions
 
05:55:21.170 --> 05:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:22.850 --> 05:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
the lights have been flickering and I'm
 
05:55:24.490 --> 05:55:24.500 align:start position:0%
wondering what's going to go on here
 
05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
what's going to go off or where the
 
05:55:28.610 --> 05:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
shingles are going to go
 
05:55:28.620 --> 05:55:30.128 align:start position:0%
shingles are going to go
um

05:55:30.128 --> 05:55:30.138 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:56:06.010 --> 05:56:06.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:11.110 --> 05:56:11.120 align:start position:0%

05:56:17.208 --> 05:56:17.218 align:start position:0%
of a long day
 
05:56:18.770 --> 05:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
um we're the only thing keeping you as
 
05:56:22.730 --> 05:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
an aft from going home so uh we will
 
05:56:24.230 --> 05:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
make this short
 
05:56:25.910 --> 05:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
um but again thank you for having us Mr
 
05:56:28.010 --> 05:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
chair um my name is Megan Tuttle I'm the
 
05:56:30.048 --> 05:56:30.058 align:start position:0%
president for Nea New Hampshire I'm a
 
05:56:32.390 --> 05:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
veteran 8th grade social studies teacher
 
05:56:33.590 --> 05:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
I could never seem to make it out of
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
eighth grade and I'm a mom of three boys
 
05:56:38.690 --> 05:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
um here in Concord New Hampshire so any
 
05:56:40.490 --> 05:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire represents and I do have a
 
05:56:42.110 --> 05:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
handout but you know as a veteran
 
05:56:43.548 --> 05:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
teacher I'm going to wait until after I
 
05:56:45.548 --> 05:56:45.558 align:start position:0%
speak to hand it out
 
05:56:48.948 --> 05:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:49.910 --> 05:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:56:52.250 --> 05:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
it represents about 17 000 Educators
 
05:56:54.170 --> 05:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
across the state of New Hampshire and I
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
say Educators because it includes
 
05:56:58.310 --> 05:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
teachers but it also includes all the
 
05:57:00.170 --> 05:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
families of ESP so the different ESP
 
05:57:03.410 --> 05:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
families are para Educators tutors aides
 
05:57:05.990 --> 05:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
support staff custodians secretaries
 
05:57:08.150 --> 05:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
Food Service workers and bus drivers so
 
05:57:09.770 --> 05:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
we don't just represent teachers so you
 
05:57:11.690 --> 05:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
will hear us talk a lot about Educators
 
05:57:14.390 --> 05:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
because as we know everybody that comes
 
05:57:15.948 --> 05:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
in contact with a child in the school
 
05:57:17.750 --> 05:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
really does have an impact and is
 
05:57:19.368 --> 05:57:19.378 align:start position:0%
crucial to that child's learning so we
 
05:57:21.230 --> 05:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
do speak a lot about Educators as
 
05:57:24.128 --> 05:57:24.138 align:start position:0%
opposed to just teachers when it does
 
05:57:26.628 --> 05:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
mean just teachers will say that or just
 
05:57:29.510 --> 05:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
ESP we represent Educators that work in
 
05:57:31.250 --> 05:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
all parts of New Hampshire so you know
 
05:57:32.990 --> 05:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
from Southern New Hampshire up to
 
05:57:34.810 --> 05:57:34.820 align:start position:0%
Northern New Hampshire eastern western
 
05:57:38.270 --> 05:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
rural suburban Urban you know if we
 
05:57:40.570 --> 05:57:40.580 align:start position:0%
represent a lot we have just over
 
05:57:43.548 --> 05:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
230 locals that we represent and some of
 
05:57:44.990 --> 05:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
those are in Cooperative districts as
 
05:57:47.868 --> 05:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
well we provide collective bargaining to
 
05:57:50.448 --> 05:57:50.458 align:start position:0%
them we provide representation anything
 
05:57:52.490 --> 05:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
that the local needs we will help with
 
05:57:52.500 --> 05:57:53.208 align:start position:0%
that the local needs we will help with
it

05:57:53.208 --> 05:57:53.218 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:57:54.770 --> 05:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
one big thing we do is provide
 
05:57:56.208 --> 05:57:56.218 align:start position:0%
professional development to our members
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
and we have a few big conferences a year
 
05:58:00.170 --> 05:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
one of them is a fall instructional
 
05:58:01.610 --> 05:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
conference and it's been held in bow
 
05:58:04.010 --> 05:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
with representative hall for the past
 
05:58:05.570 --> 05:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
few years but we do hold them all over
 
05:58:07.910 --> 05:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
the state that's our big conference with
 
05:58:10.010 --> 05:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
about five to seven hundred members they
 
05:58:11.448 --> 05:58:11.458 align:start position:0%
come in there's professional development
 
05:58:14.570 --> 05:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
ranging on anything from content area to
 
05:58:16.788 --> 05:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining to almost anything
 
05:58:18.110 --> 05:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
you can think of is there if there's
 
05:58:20.030 --> 05:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
something that a member wants a training
 
05:58:21.650 --> 05:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
on we will find that training for that
 
05:58:24.948 --> 05:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
member and for that District we have our
 
05:58:26.510 --> 05:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
new teacher and aspiring educator
 
05:58:28.310 --> 05:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
conference that's coming up in February
 
05:58:30.110 --> 05:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
and so the new teachers are considered
 
05:58:32.930 --> 05:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
the first to five years for us aspiring
 
05:58:35.390 --> 05:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
educators are those students in colleges
 
05:58:37.430 --> 05:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
and pre-service coming into the
 
05:58:39.170 --> 05:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
profession and so we call them aspiring
 
05:58:41.690 --> 05:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
Educators instead of college students
 
05:58:43.970 --> 05:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
but they are in you know programs for
 
05:58:47.448 --> 05:58:47.458 align:start position:0%
teaching or things like that we have our
 
05:58:49.670 --> 05:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
ESP conference in April and so that's
 
05:58:51.788 --> 05:58:51.798 align:start position:0%
specific just to ESP
 
05:58:54.350 --> 05:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
we also have our summer Leadership
 
05:58:56.208 --> 05:58:56.218 align:start position:0%
Conference which does do a little bit
 
05:58:58.190 --> 05:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
more development on things like
 
05:59:00.230 --> 05:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining grievances we are
 
05:59:02.868 --> 05:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
a union so all that is part of what we
 
05:59:02.878 --> 05:59:03.650 align:start position:0%
a union so all that is part of what we
do

05:59:03.650 --> 05:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
we also offer a lot of one day workshops
 
05:59:07.910 --> 05:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
we say one day those could be things you
 
05:59:09.770 --> 05:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
know an hour training we do different
 
05:59:11.750 --> 05:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
trainings on things like True Colors is
 
05:59:13.910 --> 05:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
one thing that we do it's a personality
 
05:59:15.770 --> 05:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
training a personality trait training
 
05:59:17.810 --> 05:59:17.820 align:start position:0%
we've done it with administrators and
 
05:59:19.548 --> 05:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
with Educators in the building which is
 
05:59:21.350 --> 05:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
always interesting to see them working
 
05:59:23.030 --> 05:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
together and how you can work with
 
05:59:24.350 --> 05:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
everybody that you're working with your
 
05:59:25.670 --> 05:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues Etc
 
05:59:27.288 --> 05:59:27.298 align:start position:0%
one other thing that I don't think a lot
 
05:59:29.208 --> 05:59:29.218 align:start position:0%
of people know about Nea New Hampshire
 
05:59:31.128 --> 05:59:31.138 align:start position:0%
um is that we found it over 20 years ago
 
05:59:32.208 --> 05:59:32.218 align:start position:0%
what was known as the New Hampshire
 
05:59:34.128 --> 05:59:34.138 align:start position:0%
foundation for teaching and learning and
 
05:59:36.708 --> 05:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
that was founded for primarily Educators
 
05:59:38.810 --> 05:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
to get assistance in you know things
 
05:59:40.190 --> 05:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
they needed for the classroom in schools
 
05:59:42.048 --> 05:59:42.058 align:start position:0%
and things like that over the years it's
 
05:59:43.910 --> 05:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
morphed and a few years ago the name of
 
05:59:45.708 --> 05:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
it was changed to the Scott mcgilvery
 
05:59:48.110 --> 05:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
Children's Foundation Scott mcilvery if
 
05:59:50.030 --> 05:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
you knew him was the president the
 
05:59:52.250 --> 05:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
president just before me of Nea New
 
05:59:53.810 --> 05:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire he was also elected a senator
 
05:59:55.730 --> 05:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
right after his election and when his
 
05:59:57.490 --> 05:59:57.500 align:start position:0%
term was about to start he passed away
 
06:00:00.288 --> 06:00:00.298 align:start position:0%
he believed in this Foundation this was
 
06:00:01.610 --> 06:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
huge to him he was a teacher in
 
06:00:01.620 --> 06:00:02.868 align:start position:0%
huge to him he was a teacher in
Manchester

06:00:02.868 --> 06:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
06:00:06.410 --> 06:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
um you know you know so the dean was
 
06:00:08.570 --> 06:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
changed and what the foundation now does
 
06:00:10.788 --> 06:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
is really goes to helping children and
 
06:00:12.110 --> 06:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
06:00:14.208 --> 06:00:14.218 align:start position:0%
um anybody that's you know in the
 
06:00:16.310 --> 06:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
schools can go online they can apply for
 
06:00:18.530 --> 06:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
money for kids we do different things
 
06:00:19.788 --> 06:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
like getting
 
06:00:21.770 --> 06:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
winter clothes because it can't afford
 
06:00:23.510 --> 06:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know boots
 
06:00:26.208 --> 06:00:26.218 align:start position:0%
um snow pants jackets gloves mittens we
 
06:00:27.890 --> 06:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
provide clothes for summer for children
 
06:00:30.470 --> 06:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
that can't afford it we provide money to
 
06:00:33.288 --> 06:00:33.298 align:start position:0%
help nurses in different office staff
 
06:00:35.990 --> 06:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
have kind of a closed closet so you know
 
06:00:37.250 --> 06:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
clean underwear
 
06:00:38.570 --> 06:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
um socks I mean these are things that
 
06:00:39.590 --> 06:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
people don't want to talk about but
 
06:00:40.610 --> 06:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
these are things that are happening in
 
06:00:42.170 --> 06:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
school so we help with those things we
 
06:00:44.448 --> 06:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
help provide some food so they can have
 
06:00:45.948 --> 06:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
a pantry closet
 
06:00:48.110 --> 06:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
glasses if they need them and they broke
 
06:00:49.250 --> 06:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
theirs and they can't afford new ones
 
06:00:50.990 --> 06:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
those are the normal requests we get we
 
06:00:52.788 --> 06:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
also have some extreme cases there was a
 
06:00:55.368 --> 06:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
case where we had a um 11 year old and
 
06:00:57.770 --> 06:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
had two smaller siblings the mother was
 
06:01:01.430 --> 06:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
in deemed in are unfit to parent the
 
06:01:03.770 --> 06:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
father was in prison an aunt took in the
 
06:01:05.270 --> 06:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
kids couldn't afford them so they were
 
06:01:07.250 --> 06:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
sleeping on an air mattress all three of
 
06:01:08.270 --> 06:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
them together
 
06:01:10.250 --> 06:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
we know if your basic needs are not
 
06:01:12.288 --> 06:01:12.298 align:start position:0%
being met you cannot go to school and
 
06:01:14.750 --> 06:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
get you know you can't learn so the your
 
06:01:16.368 --> 06:01:16.378 align:start position:0%
mattress popped so now the kids are
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
sleeping on a hard floor
 
06:01:21.230 --> 06:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
so one of their teachers did reach out
 
06:01:23.208 --> 06:01:23.218 align:start position:0%
to us and asked if we would just get a
 
06:01:25.910 --> 06:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
new air mattress so the board that we
 
06:01:27.890 --> 06:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
have in Nea New Hampshire is I'm on the
 
06:01:29.330 --> 06:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
board for it and they have their own
 
06:01:31.250 --> 06:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
board now but what we did was we ended
 
06:01:33.470 --> 06:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
up getting two sets of bunk beds you
 
06:01:36.110 --> 06:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
know mattresses blankets stuffies there
 
06:01:37.250 --> 06:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
was a four-year-old and a six-year-old
 
06:01:39.048 --> 06:01:39.058 align:start position:0%
were the ages of the siblings anything
 
06:01:41.150 --> 06:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
they needed that's a bit of an extreme
 
06:01:43.128 --> 06:01:43.138 align:start position:0%
case on what we do in terms of the money
 
06:01:44.690 --> 06:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
that we spend but those are the things
 
06:01:46.670 --> 06:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
that if children need them and the
 
06:01:48.170 --> 06:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
educators are seeing that that need is
 
06:01:50.448 --> 06:01:50.458 align:start position:0%
there they go on they fill out the
 
06:01:52.490 --> 06:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
application and usually within 24 to 48
 
06:01:54.170 --> 06:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
hours they have something back we've
 
06:01:55.610 --> 06:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
helped out with driver's ed for kids
 
06:01:57.830 --> 06:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
that you know want to be driving and
 
06:01:59.330 --> 06:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
need to take the class in order to work
 
06:02:01.070 --> 06:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
to help support the family but can't
 
06:02:03.048 --> 06:02:03.058 align:start position:0%
afford it so it's a wide range of things
 
06:02:04.190 --> 06:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
that we do so that's actually something
 
06:02:06.288 --> 06:02:06.298 align:start position:0%
that Nea New Hampshire is very involved
 
06:02:07.490 --> 06:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
in that I don't know that a lot of
 
06:02:10.070 --> 06:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
people know about and so we wanted you
 
06:02:11.150 --> 06:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
to know that
 
06:02:12.890 --> 06:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
different resources we can provide to
 
06:02:15.230 --> 06:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
the committee we can help with research
 
06:02:17.390 --> 06:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
we have you know some amazing research
 
06:02:19.368 --> 06:02:19.378 align:start position:0%
we can do and I know Brian I'm sorry I
 
06:02:21.708 --> 06:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
forgot to introduce Brian
 
06:02:21.718 --> 06:02:23.090 align:start position:0%
forgot to introduce Brian
um

06:02:23.090 --> 06:02:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:25.368 --> 06:02:25.378 align:start position:0%
um we have some research that you know
 
06:02:26.930 --> 06:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
we've given to various committees in the
 
06:02:28.910 --> 06:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
legislature over the years just recently
 
06:02:30.708 --> 06:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
um we have National Nea policy papers
 
06:02:32.930 --> 06:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
that we can get and you know we can
 
06:02:34.910 --> 06:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
survey our members very easily on
 
06:02:36.170 --> 06:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
different issues and bills that are
 
06:02:37.368 --> 06:02:37.378 align:start position:0%
coming before this committee and other
 
06:02:39.470 --> 06:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
committees so let me backtrack for a
 
06:02:40.850 --> 06:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
moment and I apologize this is Brian
 
06:02:42.590 --> 06:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
Hawkins he is our government relations
 
06:02:44.570 --> 06:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
director for Anya New Hampshire and it's
 
06:02:45.948 --> 06:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
usually one of the two of us that you're
 
06:02:47.150 --> 06:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
going to see a lot of over the next
 
06:02:49.190 --> 06:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
coming months um so it'll be both of us
 
06:02:51.670 --> 06:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
here um I apologize
 
06:02:53.810 --> 06:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
so some of our priorities for the
 
06:02:55.910 --> 06:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
upcoming year addressing school funding
 
06:02:58.070 --> 06:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
I know this is not a new thing for
 
06:02:59.750 --> 06:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
anybody to hear from us we want to you
 
06:03:01.430 --> 06:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
know ensure each child has access to the
 
06:03:02.990 --> 06:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
education they deserve and that includes
 
06:03:04.730 --> 06:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
all aspects of education so mental
 
06:03:06.830 --> 06:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
health you know funding resources
 
06:03:09.650 --> 06:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
everything that goes into education
 
06:03:11.030 --> 06:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
um looking at the current Workforce
 
06:03:12.730 --> 06:03:12.740 align:start position:0%
competitive pay
 
06:03:15.288 --> 06:03:15.298 align:start position:0%
benefits supported environments to
 
06:03:17.628 --> 06:03:17.638 align:start position:0%
attract and just retain Educators in New
 
06:03:19.850 --> 06:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have some amazing colleges
 
06:03:22.128 --> 06:03:22.138 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire for education and
 
06:03:23.990 --> 06:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
there are students coming out are
 
06:03:25.850 --> 06:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
leaving to go to other states why we
 
06:03:27.110 --> 06:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
want to keep them here in New Hampshire
 
06:03:29.810 --> 06:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
and so we're looking at that but not
 
06:03:31.548 --> 06:03:31.558 align:start position:0%
just the current Educators that we have
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
but also prioritize the incoming
 
06:03:35.270 --> 06:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce so that pipeline coming from
 
06:03:36.948 --> 06:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
the high school into the colleges and
 
06:03:38.990 --> 06:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
then into the profession working with
 
06:03:40.670 --> 06:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
programs like Educators rising in the
 
06:03:42.470 --> 06:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
high school and future Educators Academy
 
06:03:44.208 --> 06:03:44.218 align:start position:0%
in the high school those are the kids
 
06:03:46.250 --> 06:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
that are going to be getting credits to
 
06:03:47.570 --> 06:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
go into
 
06:03:49.430 --> 06:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
the teaching colleges the education
 
06:03:51.708 --> 06:03:51.718 align:start position:0%
colleges and then into the education
 
06:03:54.230 --> 06:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
profession so looking at that pipeline
 
06:03:56.510 --> 06:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's great to retain teachers that we
 
06:03:58.128 --> 06:03:58.138 align:start position:0%
have and we need to and we need to
 
06:03:59.570 --> 06:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
attract them but we need to also be
 
06:04:01.070 --> 06:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the pipeline coming in and
 
06:04:02.390 --> 06:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's where the pre-service comes in
 
06:04:05.090 --> 06:04:05.100 align:start position:0%
starting really in the high schools
 
06:04:06.590 --> 06:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
um you know ensuring high standards for
 
06:04:09.770 --> 06:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
our public schools in all areas and the
 
06:04:10.970 --> 06:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
last one really is addressing the
 
06:04:12.530 --> 06:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
challenges that my members are facing
 
06:04:14.390 --> 06:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
and they're facing a lot of challenges
 
06:04:16.010 --> 06:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
there's you know hustle work
 
06:04:17.750 --> 06:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
environments unfortunately there's
 
06:04:20.208 --> 06:04:20.218 align:start position:0%
assaults on Educators from children in
 
06:04:22.368 --> 06:04:22.378 align:start position:0%
2020 there was bipartisan legislation
 
06:04:24.830 --> 06:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
that was passed and it addressed safety
 
06:04:27.170 --> 06:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
plans it adjusts reporting in schools we
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
need to continue to work on this this
 
06:04:31.548 --> 06:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
hasn't stopped when we came back from
 
06:04:33.288 --> 06:04:33.298 align:start position:0%
the buildings being shut down education
 
06:04:34.730 --> 06:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
wasn't shut down but the buildings were
 
06:04:37.310 --> 06:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
shut down this didn't end I had a board
 
06:04:39.410 --> 06:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
member of mine two weeks ago maybe three
 
06:04:40.610 --> 06:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
 
06:04:40.620 --> 06:04:41.448 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
um

06:04:41.448 --> 06:04:41.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:44.330 --> 06:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
she called to say that she was hit with
 
06:04:46.190 --> 06:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
a metal clipboard that one of her fourth
 
06:04:47.930 --> 06:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
graders threw at her and she ended up in
 
06:04:49.730 --> 06:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
Urgent Care so I mean these are real
 
06:04:50.990 --> 06:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
things that are happening in schools we
 
06:04:52.788 --> 06:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
know that nurses were buying before
 
06:04:55.310 --> 06:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
covid face Shields to protect themselves
 
06:04:56.990 --> 06:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
from kids spitting on them we've had
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
biting we've had pencils thrown I mean
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that's been going on it
 
06:05:02.810 --> 06:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
hasn't stopped so even though the
 
06:05:04.910 --> 06:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed which is a great
 
06:05:06.470 --> 06:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
first step we need to continue working
 
06:05:07.910 --> 06:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
on this to make sure that these things
 
06:05:09.230 --> 06:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
aren't happening
 
06:05:11.330 --> 06:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
and the last challenge I just want to
 
06:05:12.708 --> 06:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
talk about real quick is the increased
 
06:05:14.750 --> 06:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
workload because the educator shortage
 
06:05:16.430 --> 06:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
and I know Brian has a handout that
 
06:05:18.230 --> 06:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to give you um on some
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
research from Nea but this is real we
 
06:05:23.810 --> 06:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
have teachers that are giving up prep
 
06:05:23.820 --> 06:05:24.650 align:start position:0%
have teachers that are giving up prep
time

06:05:24.650 --> 06:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:05:27.350 --> 06:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
to go sub and other teachers classrooms
 
06:05:29.390 --> 06:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
because there are there is a shortage of
 
06:05:30.830 --> 06:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
Subs there are no subs to be found
 
06:05:32.510 --> 06:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately bus drivers as well I mean
 
06:05:34.250 --> 06:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
it's not just one thing
 
06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and you know they are getting paid to
 
06:05:37.548 --> 06:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
do this sometimes it ranges from 25 to
 
06:05:39.288 --> 06:05:39.298 align:start position:0%
60 dollars per class but at the same
 
06:05:40.850 --> 06:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
time they're giving up their prep time
 
06:05:42.288 --> 06:05:42.298 align:start position:0%
in order to do this because the kids
 
06:05:44.390 --> 06:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
need a teacher in the classroom
 
06:05:46.430 --> 06:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
um sometimes that doesn't happen and as
 
06:05:48.350 --> 06:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
I said I have three children three boys
 
06:05:50.090 --> 06:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
they all go to public schools in Concord
 
06:05:52.310 --> 06:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
we want my oldest is a sophomore at
 
06:05:53.990 --> 06:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
Concord High School he called me last
 
06:05:55.670 --> 06:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
week to ask if he could be dismissed
 
06:05:57.830 --> 06:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
because he was in Commons B for the
 
06:05:59.208 --> 06:05:59.218 align:start position:0%
entire block because there was no
 
06:06:01.250 --> 06:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
teacher so he was literally just sitting
 
06:06:03.890 --> 06:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
there for you know hour an hour and 20
 
06:06:05.510 --> 06:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
minutes there was no teacher they didn't
 
06:06:06.470 --> 06:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
have a sub
 
06:06:07.548 --> 06:06:07.558 align:start position:0%
um so these are real things that are
 
06:06:09.170 --> 06:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
happening these aren't things that were
 
06:06:11.208 --> 06:06:11.218 align:start position:0%
you know envisioning or hearing about I
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
mean I'm hearing about them because one
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
as my son's telling me but you know I
 
06:06:18.230 --> 06:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
know that it's happening for members Etc
 
06:06:21.048 --> 06:06:21.058 align:start position:0%
um the only other additional
 
06:06:23.208 --> 06:06:23.218 align:start position:0%
um topic I wanted to bring up is
 
06:06:25.970 --> 06:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
you know it definitely is best
 
06:06:27.948 --> 06:06:27.958 align:start position:0%
for the Educators to be here in person
 
06:06:30.770 --> 06:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
to tell you their stories and ideally
 
06:06:33.230 --> 06:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
that's what we would like to happen
 
06:06:35.810 --> 06:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately because of the way
 
06:06:37.548 --> 06:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
committee's work and the legislature
 
06:06:39.770 --> 06:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
works and the way schools work they
 
06:06:41.690 --> 06:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
usually can't be here so you are going
 
06:06:43.190 --> 06:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
to see Brian and I speaking on their
 
06:06:45.410 --> 06:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
behalf now I do have members who are
 
06:06:47.628 --> 06:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
amazing at writing and calling and I'm
 
06:06:48.770 --> 06:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
sure you're going to be hearing from a
 
06:06:50.208 --> 06:06:50.218 align:start position:0%
lot of them this year both good and bad
 
06:06:52.430 --> 06:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
you're just going to hear from them but
 
06:06:53.810 --> 06:06:53.820 align:start position:0%
they would like to be here and I want
 
06:06:55.190 --> 06:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
you to know that it's not that they
 
06:06:56.510 --> 06:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to be here to tell you their
 
06:06:58.190 --> 06:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
stories they just can't always be out of
 
06:06:59.570 --> 06:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
school to do it because they are in
 
06:07:01.190 --> 06:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
school doing their jobs which is what we
 
06:07:02.628 --> 06:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
want them to do that's what they do best
 
06:07:04.788 --> 06:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
and so we want them there
 
06:07:06.948 --> 06:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
um so again you know we'll be here on
 
06:07:10.190 --> 06:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
their on their benefit but you know if
 
06:07:11.810 --> 06:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
you could just remember
 
06:07:13.730 --> 06:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
they do want to be here
 
06:07:15.230 --> 06:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
but they are doing what they should be
 
06:07:17.330 --> 06:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
doing which is working with children so
 
06:07:19.548 --> 06:07:19.558 align:start position:0%
I don't know if Brian wants to add
 
06:07:19.558 --> 06:07:21.650 align:start position:0%
I don't know if Brian wants to add
anything

06:07:21.650 --> 06:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
anything
 
06:07:24.350 --> 06:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
I'll just add by way of introduction Mr
 
06:07:26.150 --> 06:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
chairman it's uh good to see you again
 
06:07:28.430 --> 06:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
and for all the returning members uh
 
06:07:30.350 --> 06:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
looking forward to uh working with you
 
06:07:32.510 --> 06:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
being before your committee again again
 
06:07:35.030 --> 06:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
Brian Hawkins I live here in Concord I
 
06:07:37.128 --> 06:07:37.138 align:start position:0%
work for Nea New Hampshire and only any
 
06:07:39.650 --> 06:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
any New Hampshire so I don't I'm not a
 
06:07:41.570 --> 06:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
lobbyist with other that has other
 
06:07:41.580 --> 06:07:42.948 align:start position:0%
lobbyist with other that has other
clients

06:07:42.948 --> 06:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
clients
 
06:07:45.170 --> 06:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
um this is uh important to me because I
 
06:07:48.170 --> 06:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
have two uh two kids a three-year-old
 
06:07:50.810 --> 06:07:50.820 align:start position:0%
and a seven-year-old my seven-year-old's
 
06:07:53.448 --> 06:07:53.458 align:start position:0%
in second grade and so ensuring that we
 
06:07:58.670 --> 06:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
have a a robust uh public education for
 
06:08:00.708 --> 06:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
all students in the state is is also
 
06:08:03.048 --> 06:08:03.058 align:start position:0%

to working with you all uh our leave
 
06:08:07.910 --> 06:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
behind in addition to the information
 
06:08:11.090 --> 06:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
that Megan talked about will also be a
 
06:08:13.368 --> 06:08:13.378 align:start position:0%
document we share that our National
 
06:08:16.750 --> 06:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
Association did on uh
 
06:08:19.548 --> 06:08:19.558 align:start position:0%
reasons and and solutions to the
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
educator Workforce shortage uh shared
 
06:08:24.650 --> 06:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
that with representative Ladd and
 
06:08:26.448 --> 06:08:26.458 align:start position:0%

Miler who are all on the uh teacher
 
06:08:32.810 --> 06:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
shortage committee that had been meeting
 
06:08:35.390 --> 06:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
and I believe will continue to meet
 
06:08:37.190 --> 06:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the year
 
06:08:40.750 --> 06:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
um and we'll and we are working with uh
 
06:08:44.150 --> 06:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
legislators especially uh in in the in
 
06:08:45.708 --> 06:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the house on on
 
06:08:48.948 --> 06:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
legislation to hopefully uh address some
 
06:08:50.570 --> 06:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
of these issues so
 
06:08:53.230 --> 06:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much
 
06:08:55.490 --> 06:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I do have a
 
06:08:57.230 --> 06:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
question for you or maybe a request for
 
06:08:58.910 --> 06:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
some information
 
06:09:01.430 --> 06:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
um when I look at a community like
 
06:09:03.948 --> 06:09:03.958 align:start position:0%
Lebanon or Hanover
 
06:09:05.868 --> 06:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
um I'm seeing
 
06:09:05.878 --> 06:09:07.610 align:start position:0%
um I'm seeing
um

06:09:07.610 --> 06:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:09.948 --> 06:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
fewer vacancies
 
06:09:14.030 --> 06:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
then I I am in communities north of that
 
06:09:16.128 --> 06:09:16.138 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about Lyme or or if I'm
 
06:09:18.230 --> 06:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
talking about Haverhill or some of the
 
06:09:20.628 --> 06:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
other communities where there's there's
 
06:09:22.310 --> 06:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
a certain poverty level or there's a
 
06:09:24.170 --> 06:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
certain ability you know when I have the
 
06:09:26.150 --> 06:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
superintendent of school saying Jeepers
 
06:09:27.830 --> 06:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to ask for a five percent
 
06:09:29.868 --> 06:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
increase in order to keep these teachers
 
06:09:32.330 --> 06:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
here employed and you have a community
 
06:09:35.208 --> 06:09:35.218 align:start position:0%
that's not supportive of that or you
 
06:09:36.650 --> 06:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
have a community it just doesn't have
 
06:09:39.170 --> 06:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
the ability to you know raise that type
 
06:09:40.570 --> 06:09:40.580 align:start position:0%
of dollar
 
06:09:43.310 --> 06:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
have you done any kind of survey work to
 
06:09:45.830 --> 06:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
find out is it is some are some of these
 
06:09:45.840 --> 06:09:47.030 align:start position:0%
find out is it is some are some of these
vacancies

06:09:47.030 --> 06:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
06:09:50.030 --> 06:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
a reflective of the communities I just
 
06:09:51.830 --> 06:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
talked about like the havers of the
 
06:09:53.990 --> 06:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
world or those which have you know other
 
06:09:56.628 --> 06:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
issues going on or or is there a similar
 
06:09:58.730 --> 06:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
issue in communities like Hanover or
 
06:10:01.368 --> 06:10:01.378 align:start position:0%
Lebanon where you know they have pretty
 
06:10:04.190 --> 06:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
decent schools and and and and not as
 
06:10:05.690 --> 06:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
much vacancy
 
06:10:07.910 --> 06:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
um is there anything there that we
 
06:10:09.650 --> 06:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
should know about or that you can find
 
06:10:11.150 --> 06:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
for us
 
06:10:13.548 --> 06:10:13.558 align:start position:0%
sir yeah
 
06:10:15.230 --> 06:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
um so no that's a great question thank
 
06:10:16.430 --> 06:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
you for asking
 
06:10:19.610 --> 06:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you that I did ask my
 
06:10:21.708 --> 06:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
board my executive board some challenges
 
06:10:23.448 --> 06:10:23.458 align:start position:0%
they were facing and what was one of the
 
06:10:24.770 --> 06:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
biggest ones and one of them did right
 
06:10:28.430 --> 06:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
back that um and he works in Rye they
 
06:10:30.410 --> 06:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
raised the compensation they're still
 
06:10:33.170 --> 06:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
missing about 50 of the pair is 20 in
 
06:10:35.270 --> 06:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
custodians they're using Pairs and
 
06:10:38.030 --> 06:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
parents to run the cafeteria so they
 
06:10:39.410 --> 06:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
said this is in the number three and two
 
06:10:41.570 --> 06:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
Community income tax to tax ratio New
 
06:10:41.580 --> 06:10:42.830 align:start position:0%
Community income tax to tax ratio New
Hampshire

06:10:42.830 --> 06:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:10:44.570 --> 06:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
um if you know Bedford New Castle and
 
06:10:46.788 --> 06:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
Rye if two of the wealthiest districts
 
06:10:48.650 --> 06:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
in our state still can't get people it's
 
06:10:51.410 --> 06:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
not necessarily money okay
 
06:10:52.910 --> 06:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
um so let's start again that's part of
 
06:10:55.250 --> 06:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
the answer I that's part of it but
 
06:10:58.070 --> 06:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and just to add to that um and and
 
06:11:00.288 --> 06:11:00.298 align:start position:0%
we talked about some uh National
 
06:11:01.970 --> 06:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
statistics during the the shortage
 
06:11:04.190 --> 06:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
committee uh work but we are getting
 
06:11:06.170 --> 06:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
ready to do some more in-depth serving
 
06:11:08.930 --> 06:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
of our own local membership
 
06:11:12.288 --> 06:11:12.298 align:start position:0%
um with uh those types of uh inquiries
 
06:11:14.330 --> 06:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
and so we'll be happy to share that with
 
06:11:16.310 --> 06:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
you and we had a fantastic art teacher
 
06:11:19.670 --> 06:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
now working in Hanover
 
06:11:22.610 --> 06:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
we couldn't keep her yeah
 
06:11:25.368 --> 06:11:25.378 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:11:27.650 --> 06:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
yes first from Woodcock thank you Mr
 
06:11:28.910 --> 06:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
chairman good afternoon ladies and
 
06:11:30.708 --> 06:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
gentlemen thank you thank you for coming
 
06:11:34.250 --> 06:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
um has your group uh have any way to
 
06:11:36.770 --> 06:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
solicit from the school board schools
 
06:11:39.470 --> 06:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
themselves on about the current number
 
06:11:41.690 --> 06:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
of unfilled teaching positions where you
 
06:11:43.670 --> 06:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
have a ballpark number on that as we
 
06:11:47.410 --> 06:11:47.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:50.470 --> 06:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
no okay no you can
 
06:11:54.350 --> 06:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh we have we the one bro no yeah uh we
 
06:11:58.670 --> 06:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
we have uh I know that the uh doe has
 
06:12:01.730 --> 06:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
put out a survey around this although
 
06:12:03.048 --> 06:12:03.058 align:start position:0%
um one of the challenges and I think
 
06:12:04.430 --> 06:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
there are some legislation that's going
 
06:12:07.548 --> 06:12:07.558 align:start position:0%
to partly uh address this is there's a
 
06:12:09.890 --> 06:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
we have a major data collection problem
 
06:12:11.930 --> 06:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
06:12:14.510 --> 06:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
um and that stems from a lot of reports
 
06:12:16.490 --> 06:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
being asked of school districts but also
 
06:12:18.410 --> 06:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
representative Myler referenced it
 
06:12:21.948 --> 06:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
earlier the department is very strapped
 
06:12:26.330 --> 06:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
um in a previous role uh uh when I
 
06:12:27.430 --> 06:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
worked in the state employees
 
06:12:30.170 --> 06:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
Association uh back during the recession
 
06:12:33.230 --> 06:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of the funding
 
06:12:35.990 --> 06:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh in order to for good reasons in order
 
06:12:39.170 --> 06:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
to save positions save people's jobs you
 
06:12:40.850 --> 06:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
know those positions that could get
 
06:12:42.590 --> 06:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
switched over to federal funds were
 
06:12:44.270 --> 06:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
switched over and there really hasn't
 
06:12:46.190 --> 06:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
been a recovery from that
 
06:12:50.628 --> 06:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
um and so uh uh I think that's uh an
 
06:12:52.548 --> 06:12:52.558 align:start position:0%
important role that we need to to
 
06:12:55.250 --> 06:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
support the department with
 
06:12:57.288 --> 06:12:57.298 align:start position:0%
um and to so that they can better assist
 
06:12:58.970 --> 06:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
school districts in making sure that we
 
06:13:01.430 --> 06:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
have the data I think the the shortage
 
06:13:04.368 --> 06:13:04.378 align:start position:0%
uh survey that I know uh uh director
 
06:13:06.948 --> 06:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
Appleby put out and shared with the
 
06:13:09.890 --> 06:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
shortage committee uh during uh when
 
06:13:11.990 --> 06:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
they were meeting you know they were
 
06:13:14.750 --> 06:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
only getting a fraction of of responses
 
06:13:18.128 --> 06:13:18.138 align:start position:0%
and in terms of what what positions were
 
06:13:21.470 --> 06:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh where shortages and I think I think
 
06:13:24.708 --> 06:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
with through multiple passes 20 at that
 
06:13:26.570 --> 06:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
time Brian now it's up to about 40
 
06:13:28.368 --> 06:13:28.378 align:start position:0%
percent return from the school district
 
06:13:31.548 --> 06:13:31.558 align:start position:0%
still shallow exactly and and and that's
 
06:13:33.708 --> 06:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
all and that's only one data point not
 
06:13:35.810 --> 06:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
just you know that's the shortage point
 
06:13:35.820 --> 06:13:36.650 align:start position:0%
just you know that's the shortage point
but

06:13:36.650 --> 06:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:13:39.548 --> 06:13:39.558 align:start position:0%
you know there are scores of other
 
06:13:43.610 --> 06:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
issues Megan was referring to uh
 
06:13:47.090 --> 06:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
incidences of uh you know assaults in
 
06:13:50.270 --> 06:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
schools that's another one that uh you
 
06:13:52.128 --> 06:13:52.138 align:start position:0%
know legislation was passed
 
06:13:54.948 --> 06:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
we're still not seeing the kind of data
 
06:13:56.810 --> 06:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's going to help you all make
 
06:13:59.628 --> 06:13:59.638 align:start position:0%
informed decisions on what on on their
 
06:14:01.730 --> 06:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
you know scarce resources that we have
 
06:14:04.430 --> 06:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
this at the state level so uh I think
 
06:14:06.830 --> 06:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's something we've got to work on
 
06:14:10.128 --> 06:14:10.138 align:start position:0%
um but we we do talk to uh the other
 
06:14:13.430 --> 06:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
associations on on this I know there are
 
06:14:16.430 --> 06:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
some uh who have the the administrators
 
06:14:19.490 --> 06:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
I think uh and Jerry might be able to
 
06:14:22.190 --> 06:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
follow up with you on this I know they
 
06:14:23.810 --> 06:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
put out a survey I think to their own
 
06:14:31.930 --> 06:14:31.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:34.128 --> 06:14:34.138 align:start position:0%
I guess I want you to find there's no
 
06:14:36.650 --> 06:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
number we have no current number either
 
06:14:37.910 --> 06:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
through the shortage committee or
 
06:14:41.448 --> 06:14:41.458 align:start position:0%
through the Nea or the AFT about how
 
06:14:44.090 --> 06:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
many vacancies teaching vacancies still
 
06:14:46.910 --> 06:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
exist today in our schools in mid-year
 
06:14:49.628 --> 06:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
director Appleby does have information
 
06:14:53.208 --> 06:14:53.218 align:start position:0%
uh the number of teaching renewals on
 
06:14:55.970 --> 06:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
certificate on certificates has
 
06:14:58.070 --> 06:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
increased significantly this year than
 
06:14:59.390 --> 06:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
in previous years
 
06:15:02.990 --> 06:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
that was announced to the the committee
 
06:15:05.448 --> 06:15:05.458 align:start position:0%
um when we started out there are 800
 
06:15:07.390 --> 06:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
vacancies in the state in
 
06:15:10.010 --> 06:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals that was really the
 
06:15:13.010 --> 06:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
sore point then in specific teaching
 
06:15:15.410 --> 06:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
areas it was mathematics The Sciences
 
06:15:17.868 --> 06:15:17.878 align:start position:0%
and special education
 
06:15:22.570 --> 06:15:22.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:26.208 --> 06:15:26.218 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm not asking for the cause is
 
06:15:28.430 --> 06:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
there a number somewhere about how many
 
06:15:32.030 --> 06:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
how many schools how many teaching slots
 
06:15:34.070 --> 06:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
in our Public Schools yes that is
 
06:15:36.170 --> 06:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
available they're still empty halfway
 
06:15:37.190 --> 06:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
through the year that's that's my
 
06:15:39.890 --> 06:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
question if the information was provided
 
06:15:41.448 --> 06:15:41.458 align:start position:0%
us at the front side of the teacher
 
06:15:43.670 --> 06:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
committee now I haven't asked Steve in
 
06:15:46.368 --> 06:15:46.378 align:start position:0%
the last several weeks okay but I know
 
06:15:48.470 --> 06:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
he's constantly getting information in
 
06:15:50.390 --> 06:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
fact the surveys are slowly coming in
 
06:15:52.730 --> 06:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
from the administrators as far as where
 
06:15:54.830 --> 06:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
we are on all this okay but there again
 
06:15:55.910 --> 06:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
you've got to remember these
 
06:15:57.708 --> 06:15:57.718 align:start position:0%
administrators are piled with all this
 
06:16:00.230 --> 06:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
other requests coming in it took us a
 
06:16:01.310 --> 06:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
long time just to get the Emergency
 
06:16:04.990 --> 06:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
Management operation plans in
 
06:16:07.788 --> 06:16:07.798 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah if I could just add one
 
06:16:09.410 --> 06:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
thing to hopefully try and answer some
 
06:16:11.390 --> 06:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
of that if that's okay
 
06:16:13.850 --> 06:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
um we could do a survey with our uniserv
 
06:16:16.730 --> 06:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
directors and you know it wouldn't be
 
06:16:18.830 --> 06:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
complete because we don't represent all
 
06:16:20.930 --> 06:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
the districts in New Hampshire aft you
 
06:16:23.150 --> 06:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
know represent so they could probably do
 
06:16:25.390 --> 06:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
the same thing it could give a ballpark
 
06:16:27.530 --> 06:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
I mean we could definitely talk to the
 
06:16:28.970 --> 06:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
uniser of directors
 
06:16:30.830 --> 06:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
um this week and or the upcoming week
 
06:16:32.510 --> 06:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
and have them check in with the locals
 
06:16:36.788 --> 06:16:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:39.890 --> 06:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
I just it was January we're talking
 
06:16:42.590 --> 06:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
January and we hear schools still have
 
06:16:44.750 --> 06:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
classrooms that are not I'm not always
 
06:16:46.070 --> 06:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
certified teacher I thought I was
 
06:16:47.150 --> 06:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
someone that's competent in the subject
 
06:16:49.310 --> 06:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
area in there not just the warm white
 
06:16:51.110 --> 06:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
today something different tomorrow say
 
06:16:53.330 --> 06:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
we thought it was a sub and I think it's
 
06:16:55.310 --> 06:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's a number that needs to be known we
 
06:16:57.110 --> 06:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
only have six months or less left in the
 
06:16:58.788 --> 06:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
year and we're talking about we can't
 
06:17:00.890 --> 06:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
figure out how many vacants do we have
 
06:17:02.390 --> 06:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
06:17:04.310 --> 06:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
I mean over there
 
06:17:08.048 --> 06:17:08.058 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you okay
 
06:17:10.970 --> 06:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh I know the question was asked is
 
06:17:12.948 --> 06:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
Steve coming in on the 17th for the next
 
06:17:14.390 --> 06:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
round here
 
06:17:17.690 --> 06:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
um I don't think he's on the docket but
 
06:17:19.730 --> 06:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh we can get that information he's been
 
06:17:22.368 --> 06:17:22.378 align:start position:0%
very Cooperative in working with us uh
 
06:17:24.110 --> 06:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
he's been at every one of those teacher
 
06:17:25.430 --> 06:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
meetings which we've had shortage
 
06:17:25.440 --> 06:17:26.810 align:start position:0%
meetings which we've had shortage
meetings

06:17:26.810 --> 06:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
06:17:26.820 --> 06:17:28.310 align:start position:0%
meetings
um

06:17:28.310 --> 06:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:29.628 --> 06:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing I'm just I was just trying
 
06:17:31.250 --> 06:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
to get a figure someone didn't have the
 
06:17:34.310 --> 06:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
answer well I think we may have the
 
06:17:35.750 --> 06:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
figure we've talked with the
 
06:17:38.030 --> 06:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent in Manchester we've
 
06:17:39.350 --> 06:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
brought people in from the southern part
 
06:17:40.850 --> 06:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
06:17:44.208 --> 06:17:44.218 align:start position:0%
um things are getting better uh however
 
06:17:45.708 --> 06:17:45.718 align:start position:0%
I don't have the specific numbers
 
06:17:48.250 --> 06:17:48.260 align:start position:0%
offhand of course it's not my job either
 
06:17:51.110 --> 06:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
but we can get it we can get that
 
06:17:53.030 --> 06:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
information and we'll we'll make contact
 
06:17:55.070 --> 06:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
this committee will make contact with
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
doe with director Appleby to see to try
 
06:17:59.810 --> 06:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
and get resolution to what you're asking
 
06:17:59.820 --> 06:18:02.150 align:start position:0%
and get resolution to what you're asking
representative

06:18:02.150 --> 06:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:18:04.128 --> 06:18:04.138 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:18:06.110 --> 06:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
06:18:07.850 --> 06:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:18:09.708 --> 06:18:09.718 align:start position:0%
um regarding the
 
06:18:11.150 --> 06:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
um the assaults that went on teachers
 
06:18:12.410 --> 06:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
which are which is certainly a horrible
 
06:18:14.208 --> 06:18:14.218 align:start position:0%
thing I have my own experience there
 
06:18:16.190 --> 06:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
where a student of mine uh was
 
06:18:17.750 --> 06:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
intercepted by security after having
 
06:18:19.430 --> 06:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
applauded to stab me during my first
 
06:18:19.440 --> 06:18:20.448 align:start position:0%
applauded to stab me during my first
week

06:18:20.448 --> 06:18:20.458 align:start position:0%
week
 
06:18:21.890 --> 06:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
um so we know these are terrible things
 
06:18:23.868 --> 06:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
and they really do happen
 
06:18:25.548 --> 06:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
um uh through my research I've become
 
06:18:28.910 --> 06:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
aware of a number of common sort of
 
06:18:32.208 --> 06:18:32.218 align:start position:0%
diversionary Behavioral programs that
 
06:18:34.448 --> 06:18:34.458 align:start position:0%
would tend to keep
 
06:18:37.310 --> 06:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
troubled students students perhaps with
 
06:18:40.990 --> 06:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous proclivities in the classroom
 
06:18:45.110 --> 06:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
despite uh knowledge that they that they
 
06:18:46.850 --> 06:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
do have these problems I I could add to
 
06:18:48.410 --> 06:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
this list the names of a number of mass
 
06:18:49.850 --> 06:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
shooters that have happened over the
 
06:18:51.590 --> 06:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
last decade
 
06:18:54.288 --> 06:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
um would you advocate for rolling back
 
06:18:56.570 --> 06:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
some of these programs that do tended to
 
06:18:59.030 --> 06:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
keep more more dangerous students in the
 
06:18:59.040 --> 06:19:06.730 align:start position:0%
keep more more dangerous students in the
classroom

06:19:06.730 --> 06:19:06.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:09.128 --> 06:19:09.138 align:start position:0%
it's a tough one I mean it's a tough
 
06:19:12.048 --> 06:19:12.058 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I could not answer that as
 
06:19:13.910 --> 06:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
just a blanket yesterday you need to be
 
06:19:15.890 --> 06:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
asking questions to them they're they're
 
06:19:18.470 --> 06:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
here presenting to us we can ask for
 
06:19:20.930 --> 06:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
information yes but we can't be asking
 
06:19:24.470 --> 06:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:27.048 --> 06:19:27.058 align:start position:0%
one p one piece I will I I we reference
 
06:19:28.788 --> 06:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
that piece of a piece of legislation
 
06:19:31.430 --> 06:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
that was passed in 2018 came out of a
 
06:19:37.548 --> 06:19:37.558 align:start position:0%
study committee uh 2000 yes 2018 2019
 
06:19:40.910 --> 06:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
um one one of the uh requirements of
 
06:19:43.788 --> 06:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
that through the uh through the
 
06:19:45.650 --> 06:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and the work workers
 
06:19:49.850 --> 06:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
uh comp statute was to uh make you know
 
06:19:51.948 --> 06:19:51.958 align:start position:0%
safe those kinds of safety plans
 
06:19:54.110 --> 06:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
required plans and those are those are
 
06:19:57.048 --> 06:19:57.058 align:start position:0%
those are ones that management and labor
 
06:19:59.628 --> 06:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
have to uh come together on and so that
 
06:20:03.530 --> 06:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
that was one uh attempt to try and uh
 
06:20:05.510 --> 06:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
maybe not necessarily from the
 
06:20:07.250 --> 06:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
standpoint that you're talking about but
 
06:20:10.070 --> 06:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
have plans around
 
06:20:12.830 --> 06:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
um agree upon plans that everybody is on
 
06:20:15.830 --> 06:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
the same page about knows how to handle
 
06:20:17.390 --> 06:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
some of those situations so that both
 
06:20:20.930 --> 06:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
the you know the student and the um and
 
06:20:24.470 --> 06:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
the staff are are as safe as possible
 
06:20:24.480 --> 06:20:27.708 align:start position:0%
the staff are are as safe as possible
yep

06:20:27.708 --> 06:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:31.128 --> 06:20:31.138 align:start position:0%
further questions not seeing thank you
 
06:20:38.810 --> 06:20:38.820 align:start position:0%

let's see and yes I do realize I am the
 
06:20:47.810 --> 06:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
enviable position of being the last
 
06:20:51.708 --> 06:20:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:54.948 --> 06:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
just looking around the the speaker so I
 
06:20:57.650 --> 06:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
can see all the faces uh my name is Deb
 
06:20:59.208 --> 06:20:59.218 align:start position:0%
house I'm the president of the American

ones
 
06:21:15.288 --> 06:21:15.298 align:start position:0%
um a lot of what I have to say will
 
06:21:17.628 --> 06:21:17.638 align:start position:0%
mirror what president Tuttle was saying
 
06:21:19.190 --> 06:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
about trying not to be too repetitive
 
06:21:21.170 --> 06:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
because I am aware of the time and and
 
06:21:22.910 --> 06:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
the lateness of the day
 
06:21:24.590 --> 06:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
um but anyway
 
06:21:26.690 --> 06:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
um my state Federation is comprised of
 
06:21:29.510 --> 06:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
29 local unions across the state most of
 
06:21:31.910 --> 06:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
them are education unions we do have a

about our education groups our members
 
06:22:11.270 --> 06:22:11.280 align:start position:0%

encounter in a public school except for
 
06:22:15.770 --> 06:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
the administrator so that is Teachers
 
06:22:19.250 --> 06:22:19.260 align:start position:0%

day-to-day basis in a public school
 
06:22:28.080 --> 06:22:28.610 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis in a public school
um

06:22:28.610 --> 06:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:31.970 --> 06:22:31.980 align:start position:0%

faculty the lecturers at UNH and
 
06:22:37.190 --> 06:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
Plymouth state
 
06:22:39.650 --> 06:22:39.660 align:start position:0%
and most of our members do reside in New
 
06:22:40.970 --> 06:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are some that live in
 
06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
Mass but most of them do live here in
 
06:22:46.610 --> 06:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we of course are in this
 
06:22:46.620 --> 06:22:48.110 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we of course are in this
because

06:22:48.110 --> 06:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:22:51.830 --> 06:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
we believe in public education believe
 
06:22:55.310 --> 06:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
in engaging young minds helping them
 
06:22:59.030 --> 06:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
learn helping them you know become
 
06:22:59.040 --> 06:23:00.430 align:start position:0%
learn helping them you know become
better

06:23:00.430 --> 06:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
better
 
06:23:03.410 --> 06:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
Learners uh better people shaping the
 
06:23:06.890 --> 06:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
future we strongly believe that that is
 
06:23:09.230 --> 06:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
a calling that is worth doing that is
 
06:23:11.530 --> 06:23:11.540 align:start position:0%
why we are educators
 
06:23:14.208 --> 06:23:14.218 align:start position:0%
we work with the locally adopted
 
06:23:16.910 --> 06:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum and materials that the local
 
06:23:18.770 --> 06:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
school boards approve
 
06:23:22.190 --> 06:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
so curriculum is not something that the
 
06:23:23.810 --> 06:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
union decides on it's not something
 
06:23:25.970 --> 06:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
individual teachers or para Educators
 
06:23:27.890 --> 06:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
decide on that is a local school board
 
06:23:27.900 --> 06:23:29.030 align:start position:0%
decide on that is a local school board
decision

06:23:29.030 --> 06:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
decision
 
06:23:32.390 --> 06:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
we just carry it out
 
06:23:35.330 --> 06:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
um we communicate regularly with parents
 
06:23:37.548 --> 06:23:37.558 align:start position:0%
about students on their academic process
 
06:23:40.368 --> 06:23:40.378 align:start position:0%
progress and their behavioral
 
06:23:43.850 --> 06:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
progress or
 
06:23:43.860 --> 06:23:45.948 align:start position:0%
progress or
incidents

06:23:45.948 --> 06:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
06:23:45.958 --> 06:23:46.788 align:start position:0%
incidents
um

06:23:46.788 --> 06:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:48.770 --> 06:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
we know that students make the best
 
06:23:52.430 --> 06:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
progress when teachers and School staff
 
06:23:55.610 --> 06:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
can work as a team with parents and
 
06:23:58.430 --> 06:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
families caregivers of whatever kind the
 
06:24:01.430 --> 06:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
students have they're grown-ups at home
 
06:24:01.440 --> 06:24:01.970 align:start position:0%
students have they're grown-ups at home
um

06:24:01.970 --> 06:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:04.610 --> 06:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
many of our members also volunteer their
 
06:24:04.620 --> 06:24:05.570 align:start position:0%
many of our members also volunteer their
time

06:24:05.570 --> 06:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:24:08.390 --> 06:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
outside of school after school to run
 
06:24:10.730 --> 06:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
clubs uh for the kids because they know
 
06:24:13.270 --> 06:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
that having those different activities
 
06:24:16.010 --> 06:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
like the drama club or the LEGO League
 
06:24:19.548 --> 06:24:19.558 align:start position:0%
or Destination Imagination is what
 
06:24:21.948 --> 06:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
lights that kids fire what keeps them
 
06:24:24.110 --> 06:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
going what keeps them motivated to come
 
06:24:26.390 --> 06:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
into school and to maybe do the hard
 
06:24:27.830 --> 06:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
work and sit through the math lesson
 
06:24:29.390 --> 06:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
that isn't so exciting if they can come
 
06:24:32.090 --> 06:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
to LEGO League afterwards or you know
 
06:24:33.830 --> 06:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
read that novel that maybe they're not
 
06:24:35.270 --> 06:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
too excited about if they're there to be
 
06:24:36.730 --> 06:24:36.740 align:start position:0%
in the school play
 
06:24:39.708 --> 06:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
or running track it just keeps them
 
06:24:41.390 --> 06:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
going for
 
06:24:43.250 --> 06:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
um you know the the science lesson that
 
06:24:44.930 --> 06:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
maybe isn't the thing that's the most
 
06:24:46.368 --> 06:24:46.378 align:start position:0%
exciting to them today
 
06:24:49.730 --> 06:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
so we do all those things we also are
 
06:24:52.368 --> 06:24:52.378 align:start position:0%
involved in our communities
 
06:24:52.378 --> 06:24:53.628 align:start position:0%
involved in our communities
um

06:24:53.628 --> 06:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:56.090 --> 06:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
three of our locals this year this fall
 
06:24:59.448 --> 06:24:59.458 align:start position:0%
participated in aft's Reading opens the
 
06:25:02.330 --> 06:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
world we gave away over 7 000 books so
 
06:25:05.510 --> 06:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
that kids could have books at home
 
06:25:08.208 --> 06:25:08.218 align:start position:0%
you know take home brand new books uh
 
06:25:09.830 --> 06:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
that they could be excited about to be
 
06:25:11.150 --> 06:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
reading at home
 
06:25:14.868 --> 06:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
we also have locals that participated in
 
06:25:17.628 --> 06:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
Toys for Tots Drive in uh packing
 
06:25:19.788 --> 06:25:19.798 align:start position:0%
backpacks for kids to have needed school
 
06:25:22.430 --> 06:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
supplies to go back to school and Adopt
 
06:25:24.890 --> 06:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
A Highway programs we are part of our
 
06:25:24.900 --> 06:25:26.868 align:start position:0%
A Highway programs we are part of our
communities

06:25:26.868 --> 06:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
communities
 
06:25:29.030 --> 06:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
our priorities
 
06:25:31.070 --> 06:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure our public schools
 
06:25:33.288 --> 06:25:33.298 align:start position:0%
have everything they need so our members
 
06:25:35.448 --> 06:25:35.458 align:start position:0%
could do their jobs well to support
 
06:25:38.270 --> 06:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
their students learning
 
06:25:41.208 --> 06:25:41.218 align:start position:0%
that's really as simple as that we know
 
06:25:43.610 --> 06:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
we're in a teacher shortage especially
 
06:25:45.288 --> 06:25:45.298 align:start position:0%
with special education math and science
 
06:25:46.910 --> 06:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
and welcome back to that question that
 
06:25:49.070 --> 06:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock asks
 
06:25:49.080 --> 06:25:50.090 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock asks
um

06:25:50.090 --> 06:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:51.830 --> 06:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
I know there's that number out there
 
06:25:53.628 --> 06:25:53.638 align:start position:0%
about teacher certifications being
 
06:25:53.638 --> 06:25:55.070 align:start position:0%
about teacher certifications being
renewed

06:25:55.070 --> 06:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
renewed
 
06:25:57.590 --> 06:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that that number has gone up but I
 
06:26:00.830 --> 06:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
also know that that is not necessarily
 
06:26:03.890 --> 06:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
the same as the number of teachers that
 
06:26:08.690 --> 06:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
are actually actively employed because
 
06:26:10.930 --> 06:26:10.940 align:start position:0%
teachers who have
 
06:26:14.330 --> 06:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
retired and left day-to-day teaching
 
06:26:16.368 --> 06:26:16.378 align:start position:0%
will hold on to their certification and
 
06:26:18.590 --> 06:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
even renew it so they can come back and
 
06:26:20.570 --> 06:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
some I have
 
06:26:20.580 --> 06:26:21.170 align:start position:0%
some I have
um

06:26:21.170 --> 06:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:23.510 --> 06:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
two colleagues I worked with who retired
 
06:26:26.090 --> 06:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
in the past two years one for health
 
06:26:29.270 --> 06:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
reasons and another because she just
 
06:26:32.690 --> 06:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
couldn't stand the stress anymore but
 
06:26:34.490 --> 06:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
kept their certification up so that they
 
06:26:36.650 --> 06:26:36.660 align:start position:0%
could continue to sub and when they
 
06:26:39.708 --> 06:26:39.718 align:start position:0%
subbed since they have you know spent
 
06:26:41.930 --> 06:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
years being trained as teachers they
 
06:26:43.970 --> 06:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
want to get paid as a certified teacher
 
06:26:48.350 --> 06:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
instead of just as a warm body sub
 
06:26:50.810 --> 06:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
um but we know there's a shortage out
 
06:26:54.010 --> 06:26:54.020 align:start position:0%
there and that shortage does need to be
 
06:26:56.390 --> 06:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
06:26:58.190 --> 06:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
we need to keep the highly trained
 
06:27:00.230 --> 06:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
qualified people that we have on the job
 
06:27:02.570 --> 06:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
by showing them respect
 
06:27:05.030 --> 06:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
by paying them adequately and by making
 
06:27:08.570 --> 06:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
sure that the class loads and caseloads
 
06:27:11.150 --> 06:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
are manageable we can't keep burning out
 
06:27:13.850 --> 06:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
in particular our special Educators I
 
06:27:15.890 --> 06:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
was just hearing yesterday about the
 
06:27:18.830 --> 06:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
school that I won't say anything sorry I
 
06:27:20.750 --> 06:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
was just here yesterday about special
 
06:27:22.910 --> 06:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
education caseloads and some schools are
 
06:27:26.390 --> 06:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
getting so high that we risk burning out
 
06:27:28.548 --> 06:27:28.558 align:start position:0%
these people because of the shortage
 
06:27:30.830 --> 06:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
we're putting more and more students on
 
06:27:33.410 --> 06:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
their caseloads and if you don't have
 
06:27:36.350 --> 06:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
any time for your own family
 
06:27:38.770 --> 06:27:38.780 align:start position:0%
and you're trying to meet all the
 
06:27:41.990 --> 06:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork needs and educational needs
 
06:27:43.730 --> 06:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
and legal needs of these students and
 
06:27:45.470 --> 06:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
you have all that responsibility on you
 
06:27:49.070 --> 06:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
and you you cannot keep putting your own
 
06:27:51.708 --> 06:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
family last
 
06:27:54.830 --> 06:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
month after month year after year
 
06:27:58.250 --> 06:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
driving good people away and it's the
 
06:28:01.490 --> 06:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:03.530 --> 06:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
we also do have shortages of math and
 
06:28:06.948 --> 06:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
science teachers and we've got to find
 
06:28:09.770 --> 06:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
a reasonable answer
 
06:28:13.310 --> 06:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
before all of our students lose out
 
06:28:16.190 --> 06:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
but we can't do it by lowering standards
 
06:28:19.250 --> 06:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
of who we hire because that's not fair
 
06:28:21.170 --> 06:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
to the students either and it's not fair
 
06:28:22.910 --> 06:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
to the people who are working in the
 
06:28:26.750 --> 06:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
field we need people who can do the job
 
06:28:28.670 --> 06:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
we support efforts to make sure that
 
06:28:32.030 --> 06:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
every student has the opportunity for a
 
06:28:34.490 --> 06:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
good healthy meals at school
 
06:28:36.708 --> 06:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
because hungry students don't learn very
 
06:28:36.718 --> 06:28:37.570 align:start position:0%
because hungry students don't learn very
well

06:28:37.570 --> 06:28:37.580 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:28:39.830 --> 06:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
we support efforts to make sure that
 
06:28:42.170 --> 06:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
every school has adequate resources to
 
06:28:45.890 --> 06:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
make sure that these students have all
 
06:28:48.890 --> 06:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
the materials and Personnel they need to
 
06:28:51.708 --> 06:28:51.718 align:start position:0%
get great education and we also support
 
06:28:53.150 --> 06:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
adequate funding for the University
 
06:28:56.570 --> 06:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
system so that families in New Hampshire
 
06:29:00.230 --> 06:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
can send their students to school at a
 
06:29:01.368 --> 06:29:01.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
06:29:03.470 --> 06:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
Public University
 
06:29:06.410 --> 06:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
and keep their students here for the
 
06:29:08.628 --> 06:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
next generation
 
06:29:10.368 --> 06:29:10.378 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know building the
 
06:29:10.378 --> 06:29:12.470 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know building the
workforce

06:29:12.470 --> 06:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
06:29:15.110 --> 06:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
so those are our priorities and with
 
06:29:15.120 --> 06:29:16.128 align:start position:0%
so those are our priorities and with
that

06:29:16.128 --> 06:29:16.138 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:18.530 --> 06:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
um I do not have a handout because I
 
06:29:19.430 --> 06:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
will be sending this to you
 
06:29:20.868 --> 06:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
electronically I'm trying to be a little
 
06:29:23.090 --> 06:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
more ecological here
 
06:29:24.708 --> 06:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
06:29:24.718 --> 06:29:25.730 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

06:29:25.730 --> 06:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:29:28.910 --> 06:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative leckers yep
 
06:29:32.090 --> 06:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
you were talking about the workload on
 
06:29:35.510 --> 06:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
the um particularly the special ed
 
06:29:39.110 --> 06:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
teachers and Paras and whoever
 
06:29:41.868 --> 06:29:41.878 align:start position:0%
um and I know 30 years ago I was blown
 
06:29:44.570 --> 06:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
away by the amount of paperwork that
 
06:29:48.170 --> 06:29:48.180 align:start position:0%
needed to be done is that has that
 
06:29:50.510 --> 06:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
gotten any better or worse or what is
 
06:29:53.150 --> 06:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
that like these days
 
06:29:57.170 --> 06:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
it has gotten more complex
 
06:30:00.770 --> 06:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
even even though it is done on computer
 
06:30:03.350 --> 06:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
there are so many different forms you
 
06:30:06.288 --> 06:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
have to fill out and legal requirements
 
06:30:06.298 --> 06:30:08.270 align:start position:0%
have to fill out and legal requirements
that

06:30:08.270 --> 06:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:30:11.510 --> 06:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
would seem to be duplicative
 
06:30:13.610 --> 06:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
but you still have to fill out this form
 
06:30:16.750 --> 06:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
and that form and
 
06:30:19.490 --> 06:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
within certain timelines so there's a
 
06:30:21.350 --> 06:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
fair amount of stress there and in many
 
06:30:23.990 --> 06:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
districts you have people who are
 
06:30:26.270 --> 06:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
particularly Elementary level are both
 
06:30:28.910 --> 06:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
case managing and teaching
 
06:30:32.750 --> 06:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
so you're not just with the students
 
06:30:36.048 --> 06:30:36.058 align:start position:0%
worrying about okay how do I help them
 
06:30:39.230 --> 06:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
grasp this concept but you also have to
 
06:30:40.670 --> 06:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
make sure you're getting all your
 
06:30:42.410 --> 06:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
meetings in in the right amount of time
 
06:30:44.330 --> 06:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
contacting the parents and arranging all
 
06:30:46.010 --> 06:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
the meetings and getting all the
 
06:30:48.708 --> 06:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
paperwork signed off and returned it so
 
06:30:50.208 --> 06:30:50.218 align:start position:0%
you're doing
 
06:30:52.788 --> 06:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
two or three people's jobs
 
06:30:55.788 --> 06:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
and dealing with a student who because
 
06:30:58.250 --> 06:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
they have learning differences aren't
 
06:30:59.570 --> 06:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to get the first way
 
06:31:03.110 --> 06:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
you present it so you're asking someone
 
06:31:05.510 --> 06:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
to do
 
06:31:07.548 --> 06:31:07.558 align:start position:0%
I'd say a very difficult job but you
 
06:31:09.230 --> 06:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
know it's not really even just one job
 
06:31:11.090 --> 06:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
with two or three very difficult jobs
 
06:31:13.430 --> 06:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
which is why you're seeing so much
 
06:31:13.440 --> 06:31:14.650 align:start position:0%
which is why you're seeing so much
burnout

06:31:14.650 --> 06:31:14.660 align:start position:0%
burnout
 
06:31:18.410 --> 06:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
it's it's very sad because these
 
06:31:21.650 --> 06:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
children need
 
06:31:24.590 --> 06:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
the dedicated professionals who have the
 
06:31:27.610 --> 06:31:27.620 align:start position:0%
passion to work with them
 
06:31:32.510 --> 06:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
and to burn such people out on meeting
 
06:31:35.810 --> 06:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
paperwork demand is it's a crying shame
 
06:31:38.690 --> 06:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:40.788 --> 06:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:31:42.650 --> 06:31:42.660 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:31:44.150 --> 06:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I have anything else to
 
06:31:45.650 --> 06:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
say about it
 
06:31:47.628 --> 06:31:47.638 align:start position:0%
no I just wondered
 
06:31:51.070 --> 06:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
do you have any suggestions
 
06:31:51.080 --> 06:31:55.330 align:start position:0%
do you have any suggestions
[Laughter]

06:31:55.330 --> 06:31:55.340 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:31:58.730 --> 06:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
can you pass them on one suggestion
 
06:32:00.890 --> 06:32:00.900 align:start position:0%
might be to to try and split the case
 
06:32:03.048 --> 06:32:03.058 align:start position:0%
management from the actual teaching
 
06:32:04.910 --> 06:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
portion of it so that you could have
 
06:32:07.850 --> 06:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
someone focusing strictly on the
 
06:32:09.948 --> 06:32:09.958 align:start position:0%
students needs and someone else focusing
 
06:32:14.090 --> 06:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
on kind of the legal and paperwork
 
06:32:16.310 --> 06:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
aspect of it
 
06:32:16.320 --> 06:32:18.170 align:start position:0%
aspect of it
that

06:32:18.170 --> 06:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:32:20.330 --> 06:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
and so as someone who came out of
 
06:32:23.150 --> 06:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
working with kit I was one of those tier
 
06:32:25.250 --> 06:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
two people who who tried to work with
 
06:32:27.350 --> 06:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
the kids so they wouldn't you know end
 
06:32:30.770 --> 06:32:30.780 align:start position:0%
up in special ed so try and help them
 
06:32:33.890 --> 06:32:33.900 align:start position:0%
before they they kind of identified that
 
06:32:36.170 --> 06:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
would be an ideal thing because that's
 
06:32:38.868 --> 06:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
kind of a great Niche to be in you know
 
06:32:40.970 --> 06:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
working with the kids and seeing how
 
06:32:43.548 --> 06:32:43.558 align:start position:0%
their minds work and and finding that
 
06:32:46.670 --> 06:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
thing that Sparks the learning that aha
 
06:32:51.890 --> 06:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:53.570 --> 06:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
06:32:53.580 --> 06:32:54.770 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
committee

06:32:54.770 --> 06:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
