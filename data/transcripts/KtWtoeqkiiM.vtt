Senate Bill 478 does the following one
 
00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 align:start position:0%
it is consistent with existing
 
00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 align:start position:0%

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 align:start position:0%
necessary we staff eligibility
 
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 align:start position:0%

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
become unnecessary yet remains an

next good morning members of the
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
committee um my name is Melissa Clement
 
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
I'm the chief of the childcare licensing
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
unit in the Department of Health and
 
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
Human Services and I'm happy to answer
 
00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:31.879 align:start position:0%
any questions you have on the bill the
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
way it was presented is consistent with
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
what we recommended
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
so if you have any questions I'd be
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them are there any
 
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
committee uh yes appr um so the
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
information about like informing the
 
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
local Health officer and fire department
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
um presumably that's so that they're
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
aware that
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
there's yes and it when when we notify
 
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
them it comes after the fact um so thank
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to provide
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
clarification the programs have already
 
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
gone to their local towns to get zoning
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
approval the fire inspector has already
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
inspected it the health officer has
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
already inspected it so they're well
 
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
aware that the application process is
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
happening um and everything else is
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
available online once we issue the
 
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.269 align:start position:0%
available online once we issue the
license

00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
questions uh I can you talk to me about
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
the new section um page three Section 8
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
U sorry uh about the new $2,000
 
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
penalty sure absolutely so um our
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
residential program Child Care programs
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
which are our 24-hour care programs for
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
youth um we do not have a fine structure
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
in place for them and the reason we
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to add it is so that we have a
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
consistent process with child daycares
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
and our camp programs but also to allow
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
us additional remedies because right now
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
we would go from we cite them on a
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
statement of findings they provide a
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan we then have the
 
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
option to either suspend or revoke their
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
license there's nothing there's no
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
middle ground so we go from the you know
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
the one citation to or not just one
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
citation but after repeat citations
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
there's no other remedy and it has been
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
found that in general when we're working
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
with programs sometimes administering a
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
fine is what helps in order for them to
