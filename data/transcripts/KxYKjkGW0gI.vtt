00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't care what you call each other my
 
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
name's will if you see me in the Hall of
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
me I'm not chairman I'm not this I'm
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
just will and that's the way I like it
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
um so you can call me whatever you want
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
but I just prefer that
 
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
um we try to run the committee so we
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
um in a non-combative way
 
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
we get into some issues at times that we
 
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
know that are very emotional for either
 
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.730 align:start position:0%
know that are very emotional for either
side

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
and at times we will disagree and we
 
00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.870 align:start position:0%
and at times we will disagree and we
have

00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
um we try not to be disagreeable in the
 
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.069 align:start position:0%
um we try not to be disagreeable in the
room

00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
um and I again I understand it can be uh
 
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.930 align:start position:0%
um and I again I understand it can be uh
angering

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
angering
 
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
um if you really want something and it
 
00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019 align:start position:0%
it may fail or you don't want something
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
and it passes
 
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.069 align:start position:0%
and it passes
um

00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately we're all trying to do a good
 
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
job of the best of our abilities so I
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
like to give people leeway
 
00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:26.459 align:start position:0%
um when asking a question if it's a
 
00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
run-on question or it's really not one
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
of those questions that some of you
 
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
freshmen will learn when you kind of
 
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
make a statement and it's not really a
 
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.610 align:start position:0%
make a statement and it's not really a
question

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
um you know we all try to help everybody
 
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
out with that I think the only thing
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
that really bothered me that that I
 
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
really don't like
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
um to be careful of
 
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.290 align:start position:0%
um to be careful of
is

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
how sometimes we treat
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
some of the people that come up in front
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
of us and and will speak on behalf or
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
against a bill
 
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
we could be really gung-ho in favor of
 
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
what they're saying or really adamantly
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
against what they're saying
 
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.410 align:start position:0%
against what they're saying
and

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
um you know we kind of got to keep our
 
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
emotions the way they are and if you
 
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
want to ask a question that's fine they
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
re the the goal of asking a question is
 
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
to learn something
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
not to say well are you aware that
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
everything you're saying is is in
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
violation of of so and so or con totally
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
contradictive to these three articles
 
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
that's not really
 
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.329 align:start position:0%
that's not really
um

00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:20.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
you're arguing your point we don't argue
 
00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
our point with the presenter it's okay
 
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
to challenge something they say and ask
 
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:29.660 align:start position:0%
them to
 
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
be a little more specific or clarify
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
what they're saying
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
um but just try to be respectful and and
 
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.370 align:start position:0%
um but just try to be respectful and and
again

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.069 align:start position:0%
again
um

00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a lot for me to gavel
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
you to stop
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
I like to try to let everyone
 
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.410 align:start position:0%
I like to try to let everyone
um

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
you know Act is the way they feel they
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
should as a representative so just just
 
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
a couple of those things to keep in mind
 
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have a much more
 
00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.850 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have a much more
difficult

00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
schedule than we've ever had that I can
 
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.030 align:start position:0%
schedule than we've ever had that I can
recall

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
recall
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
not the number of bills we have which
 
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
are 14 so much but we have nine early
 
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
bills those are bills with a financial
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
note next to them
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
um as as many you know when you have a
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
bill we are the policy committee we're
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
going to decide on the policy but if it
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
has some kind of mechanism that may cost
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
the state or County money it has to go
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
to a division of the finance
 
00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not they want to
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
pass it there the the money committee
 
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
after we go through ours
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
because of that we have to have nine of
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
these bills out of here by February 16th
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
um which is three quarters of of the
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
amount of bills we have
 
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.870 align:start position:0%
amount of bills we have
now

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.769 align:start position:0%
now
um

00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
this room is occupied by two other
 
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.009 align:start position:0%
this room is occupied by two other
committees

00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
and Labor's always had Thursday and I
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
got a great call from representative
 
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
colcum saying well how do we meet on
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
Thursdays if we're going to have house
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
sessions on Thursdays
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
normally there was plenty of time in
 
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.509 align:start position:0%
normally there was plenty of time in
between

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
and it's never been a problem this year
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a problem
 
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
number one we're going to have so many
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
bills that come out that have no
 
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
recommendation that there's going to be
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
a lot more debate on the floor
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
so they're trying to schedule more house
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
sessions thinking it's going to take a
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
lot longer than it has in the past
 
00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:20.030 align:start position:0%
lot longer than it has in the past
um

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
so they're holding these and then we
 
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
have to have so many out so early so a
 
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
combination of these things the schedule
 
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
so far is going to be the if you've seen
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
the maybe you haven't seen the calendar
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be hearing six bills on
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
the 19th
 
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
it'll be in the calendar tomorrow and
 
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.250 align:start position:0%
it'll be in the calendar tomorrow and
then

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
five on the 26th
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
Thursday the 19th Thursday the 26th I've
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
been told by the the clerk that will not
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
be house sessions on those two days so
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
we can do that
 
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
we do have long days here but I
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
recognize people have jobs and other
 
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
things that they can't be here and I
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
want to do two a day and three a day and
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
have you come back two days a week we
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
try to do a full day so we start at 10
 
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.129 align:start position:0%
try to do a full day so we start at 10
A.M

00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
A.M
 
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
cognitive the fact that some people have
 
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
to drive here a distance so we're
 
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
starting at 10 A.M and our last hearing
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
is usually around three o'clock which
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
gives us time to be out of here
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully by four o'clock or if we're
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
behind if any uh because I have to make
 
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
a guess when I look at every bill and I
 
00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019 align:start position:0%
read every bill I have to make a guess
 
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
and how many minutes it's going to take
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
um and do I need an hour do I need a
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
half an hour or what have you to to go
 
00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:31.019 align:start position:0%
through that hearing so we have a little
 
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
fudge room at the end or before lunch I
 
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
try to make it so we can get caught up

00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
here in the 20s on the 19th I am aware
 
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
people have already told me I can't be
 
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
here on the 26th Camp here in the 19th I
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
but we have to keep up with what you
 
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
know with with hearing these bills
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
and then get caught up with your your
 
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
fellow Representatives if you have any
 
00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
questions about what went on and you can
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
see the videos because I believe they're
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
um after they're where our hearings are
 
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
recorded they're on YouTube
 
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
so you can catch
 
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
um what went on and the questions back
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
and forth
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%

that is the OSHA Bill I'm going to call
it

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.020 align:start position:0%

oh the OSHA Bill I'm going to call it
 
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's House Bill uh 232.
 
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
this was a study a bill that was a study
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
committee that uh representative
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
seaworth and I was Sullivan shared and
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
representative avalani who's not here
 
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
not me
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
I wasn't on okay that's correct I always
 
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
think you were sorry represent abalani
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
who's not here representative Sullivan
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
and I we worked on this this um update
 
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
to our current OSHA standards for
 
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.730 align:start position:0%
to our current OSHA standards for
um

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
non-public employees
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
um put and the reason is it's very
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
complicated and it's a multi-hundred
 
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
page OSHA document and there's a few
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
things in there that we want to take out
 
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.169 align:start position:0%
things in there that we want to take out
um

00:18:53.169 --> 00:18:53.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
and we also need to hear from
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
municipalities the the concept is to
 
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
take OSHA standards that the Private
 
00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:03.539 align:start position:0%
Industry must use and bring it to some
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
of the public industry which does not
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
have them is not ruled by OSHA bring
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
some of that up to speed to Department
 
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
well it admits they've kind of
 
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
we're utilizing an old
 
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
um version of the rules it needed to be
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
sparked up
 
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
um and everyone's pretty much in
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
agreement but we want to hear from
 
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0%
people that may not be able to
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
be here at the hearing or possibly say
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
well we like this but we don't like this
 
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
because this is the problem it's going
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
to cause
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest mistakes we've all
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
probably made as legislators before in
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
our careers here have been making
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
passing a law that we thought was a good
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
idea and not really understanding
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
everything that was going to happen we
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
do our best
 
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
and then you find out the subsequent
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
Year oops that wasn't really good we got
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
to amend it now because that's not what
 
00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:51.539 align:start position:0%
we meant Mike you representative kale
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
you have something uh that you're going
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
to bring up this year on um labor laws
 
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh that was a mistake that was not
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
thought of during the process last year
 
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.450 align:start position:0%
thought of during the process last year
so

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
um that's the reason for the
 
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this one
 
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.289 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this one
um

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
so I just I just wanted to know in
 
00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:08.810 align:start position:0%
so I just I just wanted to know in
advance

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
advance
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
um if that's the only one I anticipate
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
having a subcommittee on
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
today we're going to have the Department
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
of Labor excuse me Employment Securities
 
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
followed by labor those are the two
 
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.150 align:start position:0%
followed by labor those are the two
um

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
Departments of the state that
 
00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:28.700 align:start position:0%
most of our laws
 
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
are adjudicated by
 
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
um so they're a great resource we work
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
well with them
 
00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:38.510 align:start position:0%
well with them
um

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
they will always tell you uh they're
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
very cautious with their opinions
 
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
because their job is to enforce
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
the laws that are put in place
 
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
and so they they will answer our
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
questions they will give us
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
some opinions if we ask but they try to
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
stay on that line of not telling us what
 
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
they want or don't want
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a delicate Balancing Act uh
 
00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:06.059 align:start position:0%
any of the veterans I think we've always
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
had a very good relationship uh with the
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
two departments uh what they had to what
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
the Employment Securities had to go
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
through covid and some of the other
 
00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:15.650 align:start position:0%
through covid and some of the other
things

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
um new computer systems all the things
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with over the years to try
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
to make them better
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and it's always been a good
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
relationship so they'll be uh
 
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
who's first
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
appointment security is at 10 30. and
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
then labor at 11 15. they'll put a
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
presentation on give you an idea of what
 
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:37.700 align:start position:0%
they do
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem necessarily if
 
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
you have an issue or a question with a
 
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.190 align:start position:0%
you have an issue or a question with a
bill

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
that you contact them directly that is
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
your right as a representative to do
 
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.350 align:start position:0%
your right as a representative to do
that

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
if there are a number of questions it
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
would be it's easier sometimes if it
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
goes through me and I present it out to
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
them and they present it back but I'm
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
not going to preclude anybody from you
 
00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
know contacting these people if they
 
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:06.950 align:start position:0%
have a question
um

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
that being said Mr Vice chairman do you
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
have any comments
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
nothing bad okay do I have any questions
 
00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
or comments or nasty jokes or not nasty
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
nasty comments
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
your mother's listening
 
00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:27.059 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
just wanted to see if we could record
 
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
the two presentations
 
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
because I believe the other committees
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
have been doing that to make it
 
00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
I don't think in the next eight minutes
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be able to record this
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we have any of the
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know I will ask I will
 
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.970 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know I will ask I will
um

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
I will after your question I'll take a
 
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
couple minutes before they start at 10
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
30 to see if that's a quick turn on a
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
simple thing I quite frankly didn't even
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
notice the camera up in the corner they
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
were so used to seeing them here I
 
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
didn't even notice that one
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
um are there any other
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
version of kale
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
I was watching some other committees and
 
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
they seem to be recording I don't know
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.159 --> 00:23:33.470 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
see no more questions I will go find out
 
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
it might be because
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.220 --> 00:26:50.390 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.400 --> 00:34:45.109 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
we're gonna start again folks
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
I I want you to know that this is being
 
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.230 align:start position:0%
I I want you to know that this is being
streamed

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
streamed
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
and recorded
 
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
and I was told that I was remiss on one
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
important item to discuss
 
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
when we have an executive session and
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
there's a motion made by an individual
 
00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.770 align:start position:0%
there's a motion made by an individual
representative

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
You by making that motion you're
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
responsible for writing the committee
 
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.609 align:start position:0%
responsible for writing the committee
report

00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
what we all used to call blurbs which I
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
guess we're not supposed to call them
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
anymore the committee report
 
00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.569 align:start position:0%
anymore the committee report
um

00:35:19.569 --> 00:35:19.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
I really want you to write them while
 
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
you're here
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
we are going to have a very tight
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
schedule so write them out I can review
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:33.180 align:start position:0%

I don't know who's replacing her
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%

material over for you guys that can also
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
function as a mild sedative as I told

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.310 align:start position:0%
real quick what I think gives a nice
um

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
overview of what's going on at the
 
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
department what we're responsible for
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
and the types of bills that come before
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
this committee that we'll have
 
00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
discussions about so the the materials
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
that we handed out one was just an
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
updated law and rule book that we
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
provide to the members at the beginning
 
00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:11.300 align:start position:0%
of every session
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
also we provided a copy of our Workforce
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
training program manual so this is
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
information on each and every program
 
00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
that the department provides both for
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
individuals and for employers so we use
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
this pamphlet when we're out talking to
 
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
business groups when we're out talking
 
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
to individuals about various ways we can
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
assist with getting them training
 
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
helping them connect with hiring
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
employers so it's a nice quick
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
description of each of the programs so
 
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
when something does come up a proposal
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
something with it with a training
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%

00:37:58.370 --> 00:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
description of everything that the
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
department is involved in from a

what's labeled the quick tips book so
 
00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:14.099 align:start position:0%
this is a book that individuals receive
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
when they shortly after filing an
 
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.300 align:start position:0%

00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
then staff in each of the employment
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
security local offices then do about an
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
hour hour-long Workshop reviewing
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing all the do's and don'ts of
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
filing for benefits so those are some
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
materials just to have so you can
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
reference them later on in the session
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
and then we also have some slides that
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
we thought we would go over today what
 
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
we did was we had
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
had a conversation yesterday with joint
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means and we pulled some of the
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
material that was relevant for this
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
group to be able to just talk about
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
today to give you a sense of where
 
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
things are currently within the world of
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
Employment Security in terms of what
 
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
we're involved so really focused on
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
labor force the unemployment program
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance taxes and then
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
some re-employment programs and what
 
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:29.420 align:start position:0%
we're currently planning to do in 2023
 
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
so we can start with that and then any
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
questions that any of the members have a
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner capatus and I will do our
 
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
best to answer those but just ask those
 
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
along the way and stop us whenever you
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
that sound good wonderful
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
okay so with the um
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
but the slides that we had distributed
 
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.770 align:start position:0%
but the slides that we had distributed
out

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:53.780 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
this first one is just to give you an
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
update as to where the state's private
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
sector labor force currently is so this
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
is a a comparison of all states New
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being in the red line and what
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
it does is it provides a a comparison of
 
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
how each state has fared in terms of
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
private sector payroll jobs recovery so
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
this is information that's taken from
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
the monthly survey of employers so you
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
get two surveys each month that get that
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
get put out one is the household survey
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's how the unemployment rate is
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
calculated the other survey is the a
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
survey of employers and that's a survey
 
00:40:44.089 --> 00:40:44.099 align:start position:0%
finding out you know how many jobs they
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
currently have and these are jobs in New
 
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so with the the household
 
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
survey the person surveyed could be
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire could be
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
working a master true suits or Maine or
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont but they live in New Hampshire
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
here with this survey these are jobs in
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and what you see here is
 
00:41:04.089 --> 00:41:04.099 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's recovery
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
when we look at the jobs lost during the
 
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
pandemic caused recession New Hampshire
 
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
is now about 1.1 percent above where we
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
were prior to the pandemic at our Peak
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
so November 2019 was our pre-pandemic
 
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
Peak from a private sector employment
 
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
perspective we are now about 6 500 jobs
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
or 1.1 percent above where we were in
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
November of 19. you can see Maine is
 
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
right up there with us with a slightly
 
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
ahead in terms of a 1.4 percent gain
 
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
since their pre-pandemic Peak other New
 
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
England states are lagging up pretty far
 
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:46.910 align:start position:0%
England states are lagging up pretty far
behind

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
behind
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
and moving on to the next slide
 
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
we certainly as you know from hearing
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
from constituents and businesses in your
 
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
District the recovery in terms of a jobs
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
recovery has not been equal across all
 
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:07.140 align:start position:0%
of our sectors right so overall private
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
sector employment up 1.1 percent or
 
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
about 6 500 jobs that's great news but
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily equally shared
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
amongst all our sectors in this these
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
next slides try to give you a sense of
 
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
what sectors
 
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
are currently still experiencing a loss
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
compared to their employment level prior
 
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic and what sectors have
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
experienced again and we try to put that
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
into perspective as well yes Mr chairman
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
what is accommodation accommodation is
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
lodging so that would be our hotels
 
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
motels so it it is broken out from
 
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
um restaurants here
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
um so the the large the the gains and
 
00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
and this data is taken from actual
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
employer reports so this is not survey
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
data this is taken from our qcew program
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
our quarterly census of
 
00:43:07.609 --> 00:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
um and employment and wages so that is
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
information filed by New Hampshire
 
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
employers each quarter when they report
 
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
to us who's working for them and how
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
much they were paid and that's how their
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
their unemployment insurance taxes are
 
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
calculated so from those reports we were
 
00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:26.339 align:start position:0%
able to draw this information Broken Out
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
by sector and you can see professional
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
scientific Technical Services sector big
 
00:43:34.849 --> 00:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
gains big gains from an employment
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
perspective so these are
 
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
tend to be more higher paying jobs these
 
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
are jobs within Legal Services these are
 
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of I.T related occupations engine
 
00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
engineering firms architectural firms
 
00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:53.579 align:start position:0%
but Professional Services but big gain
 
00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
compared to where they were prior to the
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
pandemic construction up pretty
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
significantly but as we move down this
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
slide into the sectors that continue to
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
be at a loss compared to where where
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
they were prior to the pandemic you see
 
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of our health care employers so
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
long-term care hospitals still with
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
significant losses social assistance
 
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's where our child care employers
 
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
would be captured would be in social
 
00:44:25.089 --> 00:44:25.099 align:start position:0%
assistance significant losses
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
from an employment perspective number of
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
employees and state government state
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
government down close to 1500 employees
 
00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
and that's just State that's not local
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
as well local is captured separately we
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have it on this slide
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
um and then retail retail down
 
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
significantly from where they were prior
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
um when we look at the percentage what
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
those numbers really mean for those
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
sectors you can see in the next Slide
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
the percentage uh gain or loss to help
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
you understand how significant it is for
 
00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:02.339 align:start position:0%
that particular sector so nursing and
 
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
residential care facilities are
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities that's a eight
 
00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:08.339 align:start position:0%
and a half percent drop in employment
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
and again this is data as reported by
 
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:12.260 align:start position:0%
those employers
 
00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:14.900 align:start position:0%
state government just over seven percent
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
hospitals nearly six percent and Retail
 
00:45:20.809 --> 00:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
employers down almost five and a half
 
00:45:20.819 --> 00:45:22.430 align:start position:0%
employers down almost five and a half
percent

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.770 align:start position:0%
percent
um

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:23.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
so it what I understand is that you
 
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
indicated in the the gain of 1.1 percent
 
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
that that did that equals 6 500 jobs is
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
that what you suggested correct so the
 
00:45:41.809 --> 00:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking at now is uh the
 
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
percentage gains not the percentage
 
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
gains but the actual gains uh in the
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
other page
 
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
and the job there's a lot more jobs that
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
so is that a is that an Apples to Apples
 
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
comparison so you've got for instance in
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
the professional science Services you've
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
so jobs created and and the the the data
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
from these two slides so when you the
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
slide that you referenced before that
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
first one showing that 1.1 percent
 
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
increase that's taken from the monthly
 
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
survey of employers uh that is done
 
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
those are all New Hampshire jobs but as
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
a monthly survey that is released by
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
Bureau Labor Statistics and then the
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
next slides are using the administrative
 
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
records so actual reports filed by New
 
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers so they're both
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
they're both reflective of New Hampshire
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
jobs but they are taken from two
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
different sources so they won't match up
 
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
perfectly but it it's our only way to
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
get into the specifics of how each
 
00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
sector is faring
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
um when we look at where they currently
 
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
stand compared to where they were prior
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic
 
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
so the actual job creation is a more
 
00:46:59.890 --> 00:46:59.900 align:start position:0%
accurate to look at the page
 
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
that that reflects the stats at 6600 so
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
the number of jobs created would be in
 
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
that range as opposed to yeah the the
 
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:11.339 align:start position:0%
these charts that are taken from the qcw
 
00:47:13.849 --> 00:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
program so it's actual records filed by
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
employers those are the gold standard
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
those are actual records filed by
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
employers the problem with those
 
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
representative and why we tend to
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
utilize their survey data quite
 
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
frequently is the frequency that it's
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
produced in the lag that's involved with
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
it so with like a lot of government
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
sources of data it's a great resource
 
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
but it's old right so there's there's a
 
00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
long lag with our qcew data by the time
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
um you know the employers don't file
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
that until the quarter is over
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not vetted and prepped and
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
able to be published until uh you know
 
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
another few months so there's there's
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
quite a lag and you want to know what's
 
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
going on in the interim but it's
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's as accurate as you can get and one
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
exercise that the department does as
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
each state does each year we're coming
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
up on that every February we actually
 
00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
take that data that qcew data is filed
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
by employers and we go through what's
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
called a benchmarking process so we take
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
the actual wage records from employers
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
and we compare it against the survey
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
data that had been released monthly
 
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
throughout the year and that survey data
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
gets trued up to the actual reports so
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
when we published our the unemployment
 
00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
rate when it comes out in February
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
towards the end of February we also
 
00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:44.579 align:start position:0%
release benchmarked employment data so
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
it you'll see a an adjustment or
 
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
revision to all the monthly numbers and
 
00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and so the um the slide with the
 
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
title percentage employment gains and
 
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
losses that's just trying to put those
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
numbers into perspective of how
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
significant they are for the particular
 
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.730 align:start position:0%
significant they are for the particular
sector

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
sector
 
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
um and then the next slide tries to put
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
that into perspective for how
 
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
significant it is from a total labor
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
force perspective in New Hampshire so
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
how much of the the labor force does
 
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
that particular sector lay claim to from
 
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
a number of jobs as a as a percentage of
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
total private sector employment or total
 
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
employment when we look at state
 
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
um moving on after those slides you'll
 
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
see there's a slide talking about
 
00:49:41.089 --> 00:49:41.099 align:start position:0%
initial claims for unemployment benefits
 
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
so you know this will be a topic of
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
conversation that
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure we'll be having with regard
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
to proposals before this committee but
 
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
this gives you a sense this slide in the
 
00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
next few slides give you a sense of
 
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
where the unemployment program is right
 
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
now so during the pandemic 175 000
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
people came in and visited us uh we paid
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
them benefits uh over two billion
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
dollars more benefits in a year and a
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
half than we paid out in the decade
 
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
prior to that combined but now you can
 
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
see that from a claims perspective New
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in a much different place
 
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
than the rest of the country so our
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
initial claim filings and our continued
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
claim filings which I'll explain in a
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
minute are both significantly down
 
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
compared to pre-pandemic numbers which
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
when we compared a 2019 we thought those
 
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
numbers were pretty good
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
um you know unemployment was at about
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
2.7 percent I mean we thought things
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
were good well now you can see our
 
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
initial claim numbers are actually down
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
about 40 percent
 
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
from where we were representative
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
Schultz you have a question
 
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair to what degree does
 
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
this include people who
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
um at least temporarily left the job
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
market for any reason
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
and compared to without covid they would
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
have still continued to work does that
 
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
make sense my question make sense so
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
these and and also to what degree does
 
00:51:17.809 --> 00:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
um so these numbers for the initial
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
claims only include those people that
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
were working in covered employment so
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
W-2 employment and lost their employment
 
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own and were
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
eligible for unemployment benefits
 
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
um so that those are the numbers that
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
you see here the household survey number
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
that gets released each month we release
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
it next Wednesday for um that will be
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
the December unemployment rate that
 
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
number is based on the household survey
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's a survey of about 1400
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
households in New Hampshire Bureau Labor
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
Statistics conducts that survey the very
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
protective of it they don't let us do
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
anything with it don't ask let us ask
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
questions don't let us listen in very
 
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
protective of that we've had some
 
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
disagreements with them if you can tell
 
00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:11.569 align:start position:0%
disagreements with them if you can tell
um

00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's from that survey you find out
 
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
whether people are employed unemployed
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
or not in the labor force and so when
 
00:52:22.609 --> 00:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
you see that rate come out right now New
 
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is at 2.6 percent unemployment
 
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
for November
 
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
that number reflects the people that
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
have indicated so if you're working
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
you're put in the employed bucket if
 
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
you're not currently working you're
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
unemployed but you're actively looking
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
for work meaning you've searched for
 
00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:44.579 align:start position:0%
work during the prior four weeks you are
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
considered unemployed for purposes of
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
that that published number but if you
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
have not searched for work within those
 
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
last four weeks you're not in the labor
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
force for purposes of that particular
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
survey there are other surveys though
 
00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:02.819 align:start position:0%
that get published different other
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
different types of unemployment rates
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
the the standard one that you see the
 
00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:08.339 align:start position:0%
number every month is referred to as the
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
u3 rate there's I mean we have
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
information on our website for this if
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
you search under you to labor or under
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
utilization but you have a u4 u5 and a
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
U6 rate as well and each one of those
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
captures a different segment of the
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
population that is not working
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
and is frustrated to some degree either
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
they haven't searched in more than 12
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
weeks or they're working part-time but
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
would prefer full-time so that so each
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
of those captures more people that to
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
some degree would like to be in the
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
labor force or would like to participate
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
at a higher level and are not and that
 
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
rate that U6 rate usually Trends
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
um not quite double what the the u3 rate
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
is that you know it's up we're probably
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
five and a half percent
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
right now the U6 when you take in all
 
00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
the all of those individuals who are not
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
actively looking but indicate that
 
00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
they're like some level of employment
 
00:54:11.569 --> 00:54:11.579 align:start position:0%
um self-employed
 
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
um would uh or should be captured in the
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
household survey
 
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
depending on what you feel
 
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:21.290 align:start position:0%
depending on what you feel
um

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
or how how you interpret the question
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
being asked right so if you're
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
self-employed and the question is are
 
00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:29.099 align:start position:0%
you currently working and you don't
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
consider yourself to be working because
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're self-employed and doing your own
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
thing you might say no
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
but you should be saying yes you should
 
00:54:40.609 --> 00:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
be indicating that you're employed a
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
better way to ask the question would be
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
are you are you currently providing
 
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
services for what you're being
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
compensated for probably be a more
 
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
accurate reflection in the answers they
 
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
get but self-employed should be captured
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
in that household survey as working
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
their self-employed are not eligible for
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
the unemployment program so you don't
 
00:54:59.930 --> 00:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
see any of that reflected here although
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
they were eligible during the pandemic
 
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
in the federal program
 
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.329 align:start position:0%
in the federal program
okay

00:55:05.329 --> 00:55:05.339 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:05.339 --> 00:55:08.270 align:start position:0%
okay
yep

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the claims you mentioned
 
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
I think the number of claims have been
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
filed can you give us a number of claims
 
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
that are denied
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so the um the actual claim numbers
 
00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
that you see here and I have the um
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
this gets reported out every week it's a
 
00:55:31.609 --> 00:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
great high frequency measure
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
um that's why we look at it as much as
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.109 align:start position:0%
we do
um

00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
but what you see is the number of claims
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
filed so the number of initial claims
 
00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
filed and the number of
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
continued claims filed when we get to
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
that slide not all of those are eligible
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
right so some of those are denied
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and we can I can get you a current
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
breakdown of denials of those initial
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
claims and the continued claims but
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
those are people believing they're
 
00:56:05.089 --> 00:56:05.099 align:start position:0%
eligible they've lost employment so
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
they've filed an initial claim a lot of
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
times that initial claim never turns
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
into a payable claim because the person
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
finds employment so they don't file that
 
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
weekly claim which is on on the next
 
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
slide but these are claims filed some of
 
00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:21.059 align:start position:0%
which would not be eligible for benefits
 
00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:23.660 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
so just the sense of
 
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
is that half of the claims filed are are
 
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:30.250 align:start position:0%
is that half of the claims filed are are
denied

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:30.260 align:start position:0%
denied
 
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
much less than that okay much less than
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
that again some of the information the
 
00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
research is out there would suggest it
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
in the very high rate
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
um the the research that indicates
 
00:56:45.049 --> 00:56:45.059 align:start position:0%
that the denials the number of claims
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
filed and the number of claims that
 
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
denied the denial rate is fairly High
 
00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
yeah I've been we can we can get you
 
00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
um that information certainly and then
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
look at the continued claims as well
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
yes I'd like to see that because that's
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
not you're not going to Discount what
 
00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:02.579 align:start position:0%
you're saying representative that's
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
you folks don't know that I'm on uh one
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
of the positions they they give us
 
00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:08.220 align:start position:0%
another paid position here as the
 
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
chairman of the committee you get to go
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
on the Employment Securities Advisory
 
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
Board and meet on a quarterly basis and
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's just not my indication that
 
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
in the last couple years that our our
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
percentage of declined or denied claims
 
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
is significant to the point of 50
 
00:57:23.819 --> 00:57:25.430 align:start position:0%
is significant to the point of 50
percent

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll be able to get the most
 
00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
current information on that as well
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
um the next slide looks at the other the
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
the weekly claims or what we refer to as
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
continued claims other people talk about
 
00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:41.339 align:start position:0%
weekly claims or paid claims so these
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
are the claims filed
 
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
um each week while you are unemployed uh
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
for an individual that's seeking
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits so you can see
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
here New Hampshire how we compare
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
against the country as a whole how we
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
compare against our neighbor to the
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
South and Massachusetts New Hampshire is
 
00:57:59.450 --> 00:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
about 36 percent below our uh weekly
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
claim filing activity compared to where
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
we were prior to the pandemic
 
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.220 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is about uh seven percent
 
00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
Below in the country as a whole is about
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
16 below so the volume of claims being
 
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
filed in New Hampshire is uh
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
significantly below where we were in 19
 
00:58:20.809 --> 00:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
but also significantly below what other
 
00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
um next slide does a state comparison of
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
how average duration looks in each state
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
so how many weeks an individual is on
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
average filing for unemployment benefits
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire we have 26 weeks
 
00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:41.339 align:start position:0%
available and right now
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
um the quarterly average uh for Q3 of
 
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
last year was 10 that number's actually
 
00:58:51.049 --> 00:58:51.059 align:start position:0%
when we look at it monthly we just got
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
the the monthly number for December
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
today and that number's down to 9.4
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
percent so that's the average number of
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
weeks that an individual files for and
 
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's right now we're looking at
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
about also nine percent of individuals
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
that file that actually exhaust their
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
benefits so actually file for the full
 
00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
26 weeks that would be available to them
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
obviously conducting meeting work search
 
00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:22.220 align:start position:0%
requirements they're able and available
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
they're meeting a all of those
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
requirements they're attending workshops
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
and sessions with the with the
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
department but very low percentage of
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
people that utilize all 26 weeks in that
 
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
average duration right now is actually
 
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
down to 9.4 but when we when we look at
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
the quarterly and we can compare states
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
to States you see that New Hampshire is
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
about fifth lowest in the country a
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
couple spots lower than Florida which
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
we're often compared against for a
 
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
duration perspective and looking at tax
 
00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:57.349 align:start position:0%
duration perspective and looking at tax
rates

00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
as you recall we had a bill last year
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
that was trying to limit the number of
 
01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:05.170 align:start position:0%
that was trying to limit the number of
weeks

01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:05.180 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
and based on the data that you're
 
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
showing here on this slide it would
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
appear that since we have some of the
 
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
lowest uh
 
01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.450 align:start position:0%
lowest uh
number

01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
of weeks that people are utilizing a
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
bill of that nature really is not needed
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire would you agree
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
well based on the um
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
this data on duration and then looking
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
at the impacts on employers because
 
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
employers fund the system I think you'll
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
see New Hampshire is performing quite
 
01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.230 align:start position:0%
see New Hampshire is performing quite
well

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:36.890 align:start position:0%
well
um

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
probably probably the the biggest
 
01:00:39.359 --> 01:00:41.089 align:start position:0%
probably probably the the biggest
control

01:00:41.089 --> 01:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
um to the two controls on duration in
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire one is availability of
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
jobs job postings are up of 30 from
 
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
where they were prior to the pandemic
 
01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
um so so there are available jobs uh for
 
01:01:00.049 --> 01:01:00.059 align:start position:0%
folks across all sectors so that is a
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
control on duration but the other
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
control on duration is our weekly
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
benefit amount New Hampshire we max out
 
01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
at 427 a week that is much lower when we
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
compare ourselves against other states
 
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast and when you look at
 
01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:20.339 align:start position:0%
that in comparison to the average uh
 
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
private sector weekly wage it's about a
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
30 33 percent wage replacement rate so
 
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
that that does act as a control on
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
duration of unemployment
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
um so it's going to obviously limit how
 
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
selective someone is being after they've
 
01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:39.059 align:start position:0%
they've lost employment no fault of
 
01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:41.579 align:start position:0%
their own qualify for benefits and
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
they're seeking a new job and they're
 
01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:44.579 align:start position:0%
required to do that as part of their
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility for their weekly claim but I
 
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
think those two factors function very
 
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
well to control the the duration
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
um shifting gears a little bit here on
 
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
just look at how employers are currently
 
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
faring as employers do fund 100 of the
 
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:08.339 align:start position:0%
unemployment program so and that's
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
that's funded through the payment of the
 
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
their quarterly uh taxes so based off of
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
their wages employers have an
 
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
experienced rate that is based off of
 
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
what we've paid out in benefits to their
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
workers what they've paid in in taxes
 
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
during the entire time that they are
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
registered as an employer in New
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they then
 
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
get a calculated experience rate at
 
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
which they then pay taxes on the first
 
01:02:40.609 --> 01:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
fourteen thousand dollars in annual
 
01:02:43.089 --> 01:02:43.099 align:start position:0%
earnings for each employee
 
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
so what you can see in these next few
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
slides you see that we've had a
 
01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:50.900 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of growth in employers
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
from looking at pre-pandemic to where we
 
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
are now and you can see the quarterly
 
01:02:59.329 --> 01:02:59.339 align:start position:0%
numbers of register employers so first
 
01:03:02.329 --> 01:03:02.339 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2020 we're at about 43 000
 
01:03:05.089 --> 01:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
registered employers a third quarter of
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
2022 we're at about just over 52 000
 
01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.370 align:start position:0%
2022 we're at about just over 52 000
employers

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:10.970 align:start position:0%
employers
um

01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:14.180 align:start position:0%
when we look at the experience
 
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
in terms of the tax obligations of those
 
01:03:19.849 --> 01:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
employers on when we look at the next
 
01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
slide and what has occurred from the
 
01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
pandemic moving forward and compare that
 
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
back to the Great Recession you can see
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
that the average tax rates were much
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
higher during the Great Recession and
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
stayed much higher for a longer period
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
of time so we had four quarters that
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
were over 3.3 percent as an average tax
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
rate back in the Great Recession capped
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
out near 3.7 percent and you see that
 
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
our Max average tax rate from the
 
01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
pandemic was about 40 percent below that
 
01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
we were down at 2.3 percent
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
it has continued to come down at about
 
01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
1.42 right now so again that's that's
 
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
the rate at which the employer pays on
 
01:04:06.049 --> 01:04:06.059 align:start position:0%
the first fourteen thousand dollars in
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
annual earnings to each employee and
 
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
that rate actually is a is the average
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
rate is actually higher than experience
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
by most long longer established
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
Employers in the State uh reason for
 
01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
that is because on the prior slide you
 
01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
saw the growth in new employers so new
 
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
employers when they come in and they
 
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:23.579 align:start position:0%
register they get an automatic new
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
employer rate of 2.7 percent that's set
 
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
by Statute so when you have that amount
 
01:04:31.609 --> 01:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
of growth and new employers all coming
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
in at 2.7 that does bring up the average
 
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
um so that that if you looked at an
 
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
average tax rate of employers that were
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
established in the state prior to the
 
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
pandemic that average would be much
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner um
 
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.569 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner um
the

01:04:56.569 --> 01:04:56.579 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
I was around in 2011 when we had to
 
01:05:04.569 --> 01:05:04.579 align:start position:0%
increase the
 
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
wages I think it was either twelve
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
thousand or ten thousand and it was
 
01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
moved up to fourteen thousand dollars
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
in comparing us with some of these other
 
01:05:17.089 --> 01:05:17.099 align:start position:0%
states that have a lower tax burden do
 
01:05:19.609 --> 01:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
they all are most States now utilizing
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
that 14 are they utilizing higher number
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
of weeks or lower just on average just
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
um it's a great segue to the next slide
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
so because
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
each state they the taxable wage bases
 
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
and the way that the experience rates
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
are calculated do vary from state to
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
state so when we try to equalize that
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
and get us in apples to Apple's
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
comparison state to state what we look
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
at is is total UI taxes paid by the
 
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
Employers in that state as a comparison
 
01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
against total wages paid and you'll see
 
01:05:54.849 --> 01:05:54.859 align:start position:0%
on the on the next slide
 
01:05:58.210 --> 01:05:58.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where at about
 
01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
0.39 percent and you can see how that
 
01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:05.339 align:start position:0%
Stacks up against the other states so
 
01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
much lower than our New England
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
neighbors and you can see those states
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
that have a lower UI tax burden when you
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
do compare total UI taxes paid against
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
total wages paid
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
Mr McKenzie representative uh real quick
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
to give us an a sense of how much this
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
costs an employer so per employee in the
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire based on the tax
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
rate and of course this may vary based
 
01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
on experience rating and things like
 
01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:38.339 align:start position:0%
that what does the average employer pay
 
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
per employee
 
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
so with the the 1.42 and you had to ask
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
me this question because in my other
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
copy of the slides I actually had a
 
01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:50.339 align:start position:0%
cheat sheet anticipating that question I
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
think the 1.42 percent translates to
 
01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
um it's like either 198 or 199 dollars
 
01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
per year per employee so 1.42 of 14 000
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
in annual wages so for each employee
 
01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
that hits that 14
 
01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
000 that that employer is paying about
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
two hundred dollars in taxes that year a
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
um and then um trust fund you know
 
01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
that's a a topic that uh chairman
 
01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
infantine and and the department
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
um review quite frequently
 
01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
um but uh this slide that next slide
 
01:07:32.809 --> 01:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
shows you how the trust fund
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
um is currently looking and we are at
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
about 358 million dollars in that
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
account uh right now
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
um at the start of the pandemic we're at
 
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
about 300 million
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
um considered solvent by federal
 
01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.329 align:start position:0%
um considered solvent by federal
standards

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:47.339 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
um at that point I will tell you that
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
360 million is much more
 
01:07:54.119 --> 01:07:54.730 align:start position:0%
360 million is much more
um

01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:54.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
realistically solvent when we look at
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
prior economic downturns and what that
 
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
has done to the unemployment trust fund
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
so that that all of the
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
information we've talked about so far
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
this morning is contributing to this
 
01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:14.339 align:start position:0%
growth in the trust fund right more
 
01:08:14.339 --> 01:08:15.729 align:start position:0%
growth in the trust fund right more
employers

01:08:15.729 --> 01:08:15.739 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
low weekly benefit payments going out
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
um so all of that and low duration all
 
01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
of that contributes to the growth in the
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
trust fund the impact of the growth in
 
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
the trust fund and the impact of quick
 
01:08:35.329 --> 01:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
growth in the trust fund is that as of
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
the fourth quarter of last year
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
employers were already getting
 
01:08:39.719 --> 01:08:41.150 align:start position:0%
employers were already getting
um

01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
um tax rate reductions or fund balance
 
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
reductions as they're referred to in the
 
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
statute and again that's a statutory
 
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
solvency control that says all right the
 
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
fund is grow has reached a sufficient
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
level where we can slow growth we can
 
01:08:59.570 --> 01:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
slow or lessen the amount of tax burden
 
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
on employers that are funding this so as
 
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
of the fourth quarter employers received
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
a half Point reduction
 
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
in their tax rates that continues for
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
this first quarter which is
 
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
traditionally the most expensive quarter
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
for them and what that does is for
 
01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:16.259 align:start position:0%
example that new employer that starts
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
with that 2.7 percent rate that new
 
01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:19.789 align:start position:0%
with that 2.7 percent rate that new
employer

01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
The Experience rate stays 2.7 for that
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
employer for four quarters however when
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
we have these fund balance reductions
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
that employer gets knocked down to 2.2
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
percent if you are at 1.5 it knocks you
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
down to one percent so a significant
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
reduction to employers and again it's
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
because of the quick growth in the trust
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
fund um what that what that translates
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
to in terms of tax savings for those
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
employers for the fourth quarter in this
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
first quarter is about 28 million
 
01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:51.179 align:start position:0%
dollars most of that from the first
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
quarter because that's when the Lion's
 
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
Share of of UI tax revenue does come in
 
01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:57.229 align:start position:0%
Share of of UI tax revenue does come in
so

01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:59.330 --> 01:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
um with hitting that uh Half Point
 
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
reduction and that's because the the
 
01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
trust fund got up to 250 million and
 
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
held 250 million for all of the third
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
quarter and it has since stayed above
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
that that next threshold is 350 million
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
so if we stay at 350 million or above
 
01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
employers get a full one percent
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
reduction and if we stay at 400 million
 
01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
or above employers get a one and a half
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
percent reduction and that's the max
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
reduction that they get to their rates
 
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
um right now we're forecasted to hit the
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
to sustain the 350 to give employers a
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
one percent rate reduction
 
01:10:38.689 --> 01:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
um it it could hit as early as the
 
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
second half of 23 but that also
 
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
obviously depends upon the uh severity
 
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
of any sort of economic downturn that we
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
experience economists are all telling us
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's 50 50. so if it is more significant
 
01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
and there are more job losses which we
 
01:10:59.090 --> 01:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
don't think there there will be
 
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
significant job losses during this next
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
downturn that we experience but if there
 
01:11:04.729 --> 01:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
were it's more of a drain on the
 
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust fund then that would
 
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
obviously delay hitting any any future
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
triggers for higher level tax rate
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
reductions for employers but we we hit
 
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
the first one very quickly folks if
 
01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:20.219 align:start position:0%
this is kind of complicated the first
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
time you hear it for all the new members
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.550 align:start position:0%
of the committee
um

01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
watching all these graphs understanding
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
these different bogeys to hit and how it
 
01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
affects the the rate
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
um it's very important from a standpoint
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
of the the goal obviously is to get
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
people off unemployment to have it when
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
they need it get them off as soon as
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
possible and make sure this trust fund
 
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
it gets to a certain level where it
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be because as you've seen just
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
in my tenure here in the legislature
 
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
we've had two major events
 
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
in 2011 and 2019
 
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
where we had a significant drawdown
 
01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
on our trust fund now what happens if
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
the trust fund goes installment it did
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
for about a month or so in 2010. we have
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
to borrow from the United States
 
01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:07.550 align:start position:0%
to borrow from the United States
government

01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
there's still there were some amazing
 
01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
some of the states that were unprepared
 
01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
um and took years if they haven't I
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
don't even know if California has gotten
 
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
their way out of paying back I don't
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
think they have any plans to ever get
 
01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
out of paying that down back so it
 
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
obviously keeps the rate up so
 
01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
you may say it's a little more
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
conservative but having gone through two
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
of these
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
um increasing those numbers has helped
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
because it has the trust fund money so
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
it can
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
replenish it easier and keep the tax
 
01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
rate down I know it's complicated he
 
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
said well if the first three quarters if
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
it does this and this go happens and
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
take another quarter away and we give
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
you this discount or whatever I I know
 
01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's it's dope unattended it's Greek um
 
01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.070 align:start position:0%
it's it's dope unattended it's Greek um
um

01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
to you but if you have any questions
 
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
feel free they're always available for a
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
call and some of the veterans here so I
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
see a couple of them watching around and
 
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
I know it's kind of complicated but
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
actually makes sense and it kind of
 
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
works so just wanted to throw that in
 
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
and I also served on the unemployment
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
advisory committee for many years so
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
um what I what I didn't hear you say
 
01:13:24.239 --> 01:13:25.130 align:start position:0%
um what I what I didn't hear you say
um

01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
is the impact uh
 
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
uh we are at about a 30 replacement rate
 
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
and that being the case when the average
 
01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
weekly wage in New Hampshire is what a
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
thousand something
 
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
so the employers are getting uh benefits
 
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh because of fund but what would be the
 
01:13:48.649 --> 01:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
impact if we would increase start
 
01:13:51.169 --> 01:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
sharing some of those with the employees
 
01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
to raise the replacement rate for
 
01:13:55.729 --> 01:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
employees and you you didn't mention
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
that because they clearly it when you
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
look at the the numbers you calculate
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
all that a low rate helps the trust fund
 
01:14:04.199 --> 01:14:05.410 align:start position:0%
all that a low rate helps the trust fund
correct

01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:05.420 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
yeah it's certainly if you have less
 
01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
disbursements coming out of the account
 
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
right it's better for the the balance in
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
the account
 
01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
um if you were to increase the rates
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
increase tiers that'll
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
um you know that would have a a negative
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
impact on the trust fund balance uh not
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting it would have a
 
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
negative impact on trust fund
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
performance uh but but the balance in
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
the fund yes and those all those types
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
of things can be calculated out
 
01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:39.659 align:start position:0%
um when you know we have a two-year
 
01:14:42.649 --> 01:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
forecasts that we're looking at for
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
trust fund performance uh with uh
 
01:14:48.169 --> 01:14:48.179 align:start position:0%
forecasted levels of unemployment claim
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
filing and so if there were you know if
 
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
this committee were discussing proposals
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
to increase the rates at which people
 
01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
receive each week that's you know
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
information the department can generate
 
01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
in terms of impact on on the trust fund
 
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
moving out and just final question where
 
01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
we at in terms of New Hampshire's
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
pay as it relates to the rest of the
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
country from average so average benefit
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
average weekly benefit amount right now
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
is around
 
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
330. this sounds about right
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
um max is 427.
 
01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.169 align:start position:0%
um max is 427.
um

01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:28.140 align:start position:0%
that 330 is uh lowest in New England
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
Maine is slightly above not that much
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
above New Hampshire Massachusetts
 
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
much higher
 
01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
um but the the current average weekly
 
01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
benefit amount where that uh Falls
 
01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
um and that and state state to state I
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
can get you a chart
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
um showing you where that currently is
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
so the the lowest rate is 27 per week
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
um and the the way your rate is
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
calculated it's set by Statute so it is
 
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
based upon the amount of earnings that
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
you had in the 15 to 18 months prior to
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
you losing your job so the the bare
 
01:16:21.169 --> 01:16:21.179 align:start position:0%
minimum earnings that you have to have
 
01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
in order to be monetarily eligible for
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits is at least twenty
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
eight hundred dollars during that base
 
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
period and you have to have earned
 
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
fourteen hundred dollars in at least two
 
01:16:33.179 --> 01:16:34.310 align:start position:0%
fourteen hundred dollars in at least two
quarters

01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
quarters
 
01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
so that twenty eight hundred dollars
 
01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
earned over the course of 15 to 18
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
months would get you twenty seven
 
01:16:42.649 --> 01:16:42.659 align:start position:0%
dollars a week
 
01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
um and then the benefit amount obviously
 
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
it goes up along with your base period
 
01:16:51.169 --> 01:16:51.179 align:start position:0%
earnings and that 427
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
um is the rate at which an individual
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
earning 41 500 during the base period
 
01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
would receive or anyone receiving more
 
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
than that or anyone earning more than
 
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Mr chairman can you
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
tell me how many people are currently on
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment right now and how many jobs
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
are available right now
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
um hot off the press so comes out every
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
Thursday at 8 30
 
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
um our current number of individuals
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
that filed an initial claim during the
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
most recently reported week which was
 
01:17:45.649 --> 01:17:45.659 align:start position:0%
weekending January 7th was 501 that is
 
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
about 30 percent below the same week in
 
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
2019 number of individuals filing a
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
weekly claim
 
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
um there's a slightly longer lag this is
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
the week ending December 31st important
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
thing about the week ending December
 
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
31st is its school vacation week so you
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
have a bus drivers cafeteria workers
 
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
they're all filing as they are eligible
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
to do that number was
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
3158 that is up higher because it being
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
vacation week with more individuals
 
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
being eligible but when you compare
 
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
vacation week 22 against vacation week
 
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
in 19 that's about a 30 percent drop
 
01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:30.130 align:start position:0%
in 19 that's about a 30 percent drop
um

01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:30.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
n22 compared to 19. so that's current
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
filing numbers and that we that gets put
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
out every Thursday
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
I believe you also had a was one of your
 
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
questions and how many of the jobs are
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
how many jobs are available well I know
 
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
um we have sorry we have uh that we
 
01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
publish a monthly job postings
 
01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
um uh data I don't have that right here
 
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
but I can get it to you representative
 
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
we're about
 
01:19:10.729 --> 01:19:10.739 align:start position:0%
think between 30 to 40 percent higher
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
and then the number of unique postings
 
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
amongst all New Hampshire employers so
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
that they're unique so if so if I post a
 
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
a position in the union leader and I'm
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
also posting it on indeed they're only
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
counting that position once but what I
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
can provide and I didn't include here
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
but it's very helpful is you can see the
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
number of unique postings by employer
 
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
by sector and by occupational type so
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
you can see how many postings there are
 
01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
for registered nurses how many postings
 
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
there are for lnas how many postings
 
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
there are for retail sales so that's
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
information that we can provide really
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's good information uh to be able to
 
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
to take a look at and it also has it for
 
01:19:59.290 --> 01:19:59.300 align:start position:0%
employers as well so you can see who's
 
01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
recruiting heavily right now and but
 
01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
those are those numbers are continue to
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
be much higher than they were prior to
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
um and then just a couple more things Mr
 
01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
chairman just to give the members a
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
flavor of what we're what we do
 
01:20:20.689 --> 01:20:20.699 align:start position:0%
um currently to try to assist
 
01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
individuals that come into any of our
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Works offices the American
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
job centers as they're also called the
 
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
one stops as they're also called but
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
these 12 offices located throughout the
 
01:20:35.050 --> 01:20:35.060 align:start position:0%
state which Employment Security operates
 
01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
but individuals coming in or seeking
 
01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
services online or seeking Services by
 
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
telephone what are we currently doing
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
for them to help them connect with all
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
of these hiring employers well one of
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
the biggest things we're doing that is a
 
01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
very easy way for employers and job
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
Seekers to connect is with the virtual
 
01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
job fairs that we continue to do so
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
these next two slides you can see our
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
current schedule we have uh one today
 
01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
started uh was going from 11 to 1 for
 
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
the Seacoast employers so we do them
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
regionally last year we did about 70 of
 
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
these over the course of the year had 11
 
01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
000 job Seekers attend those 70 events
 
01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:15.860 align:start position:0%
and so we've
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
started uh right away again with uh you
 
01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
can see our January schedule our
 
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
February schedule and then when you turn
 
01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
the Turn the Page you can see what an
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
individual experience is when they need
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
to register for one of those events so
 
01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
it's a quick registration process
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
they are then they're able to do that on
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
virtual job
 
01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
fairs.nh.gov they then receive
 
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
information from the Department which
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
assists with giving them a little bit of
 
01:21:49.729 --> 01:21:49.739 align:start position:0%
of information so it's not intimidating
 
01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:53.219 align:start position:0%
trying to join one of these virtual
 
01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
events for the first time and then we do
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
the same for employers employers
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
register on the same site we do
 
01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
information to them prior to the event
 
01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
to let them get a better flavor of how
 
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
the how the virtual job fair works
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
but again we anticipate that these will
 
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
be the dominant way that we're
 
01:22:15.649 --> 01:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
conducting job fairs for for 23
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
employers a very much
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
liked this format job Seekers are we're
 
01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:25.340 align:start position:0%
actually seeing more
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
which one would expect
 
01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
with a little bit of the softening of
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
the economy we're actually seeing more
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
job Seekers at these events right now
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
compared to late summer early fall it's
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
another nice high frequency indicator
 
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
you can you can compare a Seacoast event
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
from say January to a Seacoast event
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
from October of last year and you can
 
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
see how many job Seekers are showing up
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
but those those events continue to be
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
pretty well attended so we think it's a
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
great opportunity easy opportunity for
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
employers and job Seekers to connect
 
01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
without having to worry about driving to
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
the gymnasium at their local Community
 
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
College finding parking taking time out
 
01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
of the day to actually get there get
 
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
back and it's kind of a an easier way
 
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
for folks to connect so we will continue
 
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
to do those and with a mixture of
 
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
in-person events as well
 
01:23:20.689 --> 01:23:20.699 align:start position:0%
um and then lastly a couple of pages on
 
01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
um one of our job search portals one
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
this is one that we launched during the
 
01:23:26.890 --> 01:23:26.900 align:start position:0%
pandemic but it's
 
01:23:30.189 --> 01:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
nhjobs.nh.gov so this is a a
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
site that we host where employers are
 
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
able to post positions all of the
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
individuals coming in to utilize our
 
01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
services or not utilize our services but
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
know about it and can go online and do
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
this are able to search for jobs on this
 
01:23:47.169 --> 01:23:47.179 align:start position:0%
site on
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
nhjobs.nh.gov as well as our job match
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
system and then to get a sense of the
 
01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
the types of jobs that are on there I
 
01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:56.110 align:start position:0%
the types of jobs that are on there I
did

01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
include a screenshot of one of them I'm
 
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that all of the jobs are
 
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
comparable to what Fidelity is
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
recruiting for it just so happens that I
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
printed out a Fidelity recruitment
 
01:24:10.729 --> 01:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
position and they have been utilizing
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
this site in our services heavily coming
 
01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
out of the pandemic and they've
 
01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
experienced a lot of growth as has the
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
financial services sector so just again
 
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
to give folks a a sense of
 
01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
what we're currently doing to try to
 
01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
assist people with getting back to work
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then I also did include one slide on
 
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
our work now program this is the program
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
that we provide one-on-one case
 
01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
management for individuals as well as we
 
01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
pay for their training we pay for their
 
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
transportation but individuals that are
 
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
enrolled in Medicaid Medicaid expansion
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
TANF snap this is a program that we
 
01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
currently operate out of all of those
 
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
One-Stop centers very high participation
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
we enroll usually between 20 25 people
 
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
per week they work one-on-one with folks
 
01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
in those one stops we help them with
 
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
vocational direction we continue to meet
 
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
with them they go into training we pay
 
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
the trainer for that and we actually pay
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
their transportation costs while they're
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
while they're enrolled so another type
 
01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
of program another example of what we do
 
01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
from the employment services side to
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
help folks
 
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
you got to fill that position of ice
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
cream it appeared and make everyone
 
01:25:26.410 --> 01:25:26.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
Mr McKenzie representative Mackenzie
 
01:25:32.689 --> 01:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
um some years ago the state made a
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
decision to separate out the workforce
 
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity Council from the
 
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction I don't know if it was
 
01:25:39.709 --> 01:25:39.719 align:start position:0%
under the
 
01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
under the employment security
 
01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
but that uh they are absent here today
 
01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
but that is a whole component of the
 
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
training of work is within the state of
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so is a system that's
 
01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
currently separated there are two in two
 
01:25:59.450 --> 01:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
different entities and the thing about
 
01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:00.709 align:start position:0%
different entities and the thing about
the

01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:02.890 --> 01:26:02.900 align:start position:0%
um if I may Mr chairman the thing about
 
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
the workforce opportunity Council it is
 
01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
a separate entity in and of itself it's
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
not under government state government
 
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's not another jurisdiction or the
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
labor committee or the legislature
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
basically operates on its own given that
 
01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
is somewhat of a different model from
 
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
other states and given that you have the
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the training and
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
placement of workers does it make sense
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
to start the discussion
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
um around bringing that back under the
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
guise of the Department of Employment
 
01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.450 align:start position:0%
guise of the Department of Employment
Security

01:26:34.450 --> 01:26:34.460 align:start position:0%
Security
 
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
and to to give you the flexibility you
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
have a full range of opportunities for
 
01:26:43.330 --> 01:26:43.340 align:start position:0%
workers to tap into
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
and the reason is just a matter of
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
History the reason as I recall was
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
separated is because they wanted to be
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
able to move quickly and that they said
 
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
that they fed the state government kind
 
01:26:55.729 --> 01:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
of slowed the opportunity of them to
 
01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
deliver programs so do you have any
 
01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.510 align:start position:0%
deliver programs so do you have any
opinion

01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:01.139 align:start position:0%
competitors I think you worked for the
 
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
workforce opportunity I'm going to
 
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
deflect this one to my boss yeah
 
01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean
 
01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
right now I mean it comes under uh
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
business and economic Affairs that's
 
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
where it's located at this point in time
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
but at one point it was and and uh I
 
01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
mean you know that's up to the
 
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
legislature whether or not they'd want
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
to move I mean we've got a great working
 
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
relationship with uh business and
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs I mean we partner with
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
them on all the job fairs and it's you
 
01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
know right now it's everything we do
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
yep but they have no further question
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
but they are outside of the the uh the
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
state structure in terms of of oversight
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
but a labor Committee of the legislature
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:53.219 align:start position:0%
um I would I mean I think you know they
 
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
fall under business and economic Affairs
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
if they have yeah correct they have
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
their own board the board is I mean it's
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
a 33 person board that oversees and they
 
01:28:15.169 --> 01:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
to uh to the people and it's open
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
meetings if anybody wants to go to those
 
01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
and there are um representative there
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
are programs that we we administer
 
01:28:33.649 --> 01:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
Under the wioa Umbrella so the workforce
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
Innovation Opportunity Act umbrella
 
01:28:38.209 --> 01:28:38.219 align:start position:0%
federally funded uh programs for
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
training that we operate those jointly
 
01:28:43.729 --> 01:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
with Bea through the office of Workforce
 
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity because they are the the
 
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
recipient of those wioa dollars and then
 
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
they designate Employment Security to
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
run the dislocated worker program so
 
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
that's another program that we
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
administer with individuals losing
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
employment we're able to pay for some
 
01:29:02.209 --> 01:29:02.219 align:start position:0%
pay for training and other supports
 
01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
while they search for work that's that's
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
within that umbrella of programs that
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
you talk about and then Southern New
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Services actually operates the
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
adult program
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and they and they do that they
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
operate that out of all of the New
 
01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Works offices the one stops
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
that we talk about so we work quite
 
01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
closely with them in administering those
 
01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
programs this work now program that we
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
included information on is a purely
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
state funded state-run program but it
 
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
works in conjunction and with those wioa
 
01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
Federal training programs because we we
 
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
are obligated to pay federal training
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
dollars before we put State training
 
01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
dollars forward so those those two
 
01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
programs get stacked together for
 
01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:46.250 align:start position:0%
programs get stacked together for
individuals

01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
we have to wrap this up but um I thought
 
01:29:51.890 --> 01:29:51.900 align:start position:0%
I would recommend the folks go on the
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
department of unemployment Securities
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
website there's a lot of information
 
01:29:57.770 --> 01:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more things they do
 
01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
trading Services uh just to become aware
 
01:30:03.729 --> 01:30:03.739 align:start position:0%
the only question I have is
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
you um are very good about providing
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
benefits to individuals when they come
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
to you to try to do it as quickly as
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
possible and then sometimes you find out
 
01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
individuals that applied and received
 
01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
benefits did not qualify
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
and you're in that situation now where
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
you have a number of individuals can you
 
01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:25.139 align:start position:0%
tell us what kind of a backlog you have
 
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:27.900 align:start position:0%
on the hearings for individuals that
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
you've determined that or it's your
 
01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
opinion that they receive benefits they
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
did not uh
 
01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.990 align:start position:0%
did not uh
qualify

01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
um so from a a hearing perspective so
 
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
individuals that
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
um just the hearings that people get are
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
those that when they disagree with that
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
determination that they get we have an
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
extensive administrative appeal
 
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
structure that goes all the way up to
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:30:54.169 --> 01:30:54.179 align:start position:0%
um there there currently is no backlog
 
01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
on those hearings so if you disagree
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
with being denied benefits
 
01:30:59.639 --> 01:31:00.530 align:start position:0%
with being denied benefits
um

01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
it was you thought the the separation
 
01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
was the employer's fault
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
um it was determined it was your fault
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
through something that you you a
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
position that you quit but you you were
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
determined not to be unemployed through
 
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
no fault of your own
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
um those hearings are getting scheduled
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
in less than 30 days from when that
 
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
point from when that is filed so those
 
01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
are are meeting all timeliness standards
 
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
as imposed on states by the federal U.S
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor
 
01:31:32.209 --> 01:31:32.219 align:start position:0%
um so we're very good there that's not
 
01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
the case with other states still dealing
 
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
with a pandemic backlog still looking at
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
paying people pandemic unemployment
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
assistance so some struggles there with
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
other states but we're caught up from
 
01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
that perspective individuals that
 
01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
receive benefits that should not have
 
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
and this is a a topic that does come up
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
for a conversation
 
01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
um with with this body so right now if
 
01:31:59.810 --> 01:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
your paid benefits that you should not
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
have been paid in the Department's
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
screwed up right we put you on the wrong
 
01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
program we incorrectly adjudicated your
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
separation as qualifying when in fact it
 
01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
wasn't or maybe maybe the employer
 
01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
didn't provide us some information as
 
01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
quickly as they should have
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
um when we find that out and it is
 
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
determined that you are not eligible but
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's not because anything you did you
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
thought you were eligible you filed your
 
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
claim and you were paid you are found
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
overpaid but it's not your fault so you
 
01:32:33.649 --> 01:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
are without fault and you don't have to
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
repay those benefits okay so those
 
01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
individuals they're they're not eligible
 
01:32:40.129 --> 01:32:40.139 align:start position:0%
they are not eligible to continue to
 
01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
file but they don't have to pay the
 
01:32:44.209 --> 01:32:44.219 align:start position:0%
benefits back and they can they can
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
appeal right that eligibility
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
determination if they disagree with it
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
however if you file and you're paid and
 
01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
it is determined that you are paid
 
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
through some sort of misrepresentation
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
and information that you provided to us
 
01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:01.139 align:start position:0%
or didn't provide and it was reasonable
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
to think that you should have you would
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
again be found overpaid and in those
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances it would be your fault you
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
would be on the hook for repaying those
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
benefits it's a civil decision we have
 
01:33:16.129 --> 01:33:16.139 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for ensuring that you repay
 
01:33:17.689 --> 01:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
it we try to get people into payment
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
agreements when they don't do that we we
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
garnish wages we garnish your federal
 
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
tax income tax refund but that's a civil
 
01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:26.930 align:start position:0%
tax income tax refund but that's a civil
decision

01:33:26.930 --> 01:33:26.940 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:27.590 align:start position:0%
decision
um

01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
we do have situations where people
 
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
intentionally lie to us right they
 
01:33:34.129 --> 01:33:34.139 align:start position:0%
intentionally misrepresent going back to
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
work having earnings when they go back
 
01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
to work they file they are eligible when
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
they file but then they get another job
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
and they don't tell us about it despite
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
us asking on those weekly continued
 
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
claims are you working are you earning
 
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
any money they tell us nothing they go
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
on for several weeks those individuals
 
01:33:55.729 --> 01:33:55.739 align:start position:0%
are found to have committed fraud they
 
01:33:58.010 --> 01:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
are found overpaid the more egregious
 
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
cases get prosecuted in conjunction with
 
01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
a uh unemployment insurance prosecutor
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
that is housed in the criminal Bureau at
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice paid for by
 
01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
this agency so those occasionally you'll
 
01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
see those in the newspaper on those more
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
egregious cases the people failed to
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
report earnings and work and continue to
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
file for unemployment we go after those
 
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
people quite aggressively because we
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
want to make sure people are aware that
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's a serious crime and it's that you
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
need to to take your responses to those
 
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
questions on your weekly claim very
 
01:34:35.209 --> 01:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
seriously other individuals that have
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
engaged in that type of conduct not as
 
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
egregious but again they misrepresented
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
to us they would have a civil fraud
 
01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
decision again have to repay it we have
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
various mechanisms for collecting that
 
01:34:50.209 --> 01:34:50.219 align:start position:0%
but it's not something that we would go
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
after criminally so that's an ongoing
 
01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.410 align:start position:0%
after criminally so that's an ongoing
issue

01:34:53.410 --> 01:34:53.420 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
regardless of how much activity we have
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
of trying to educate people when they
 
01:35:00.490 --> 01:35:00.500 align:start position:0%
come in to file
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
it always occurs it happens in every
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
state and we we do our best to detect it
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
early to have as minimal impact on the
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
trust fund and then we aggressively
 
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
pursue collection with individuals that
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
have engaged in that type of conduct
 
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
some quick questions because we're
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
behind representative Schultz
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
do you keep track of the percentage of
 
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
no fault
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
um employees and do you keep track of
 
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
the number of redeterminations
 
01:35:35.050 --> 01:35:35.060 align:start position:0%
of amount
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
employees are paid you know the re I
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
think that's the name of when you
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
refigure what a rate is per employee do
 
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
you keep track of redeterminations per
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
um so the overpayments for no fault
 
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
versus fault yes we have that
 
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
information we can provide that to you
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
the the redeterminations are you talking
 
01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
about redetermining a benefit amount or
 
01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:05.270 align:start position:0%
about redetermining a benefit amount or
yes

01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
um they're probably multiple reasons
 
01:36:11.209 --> 01:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
certainly if your office discovers the
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
no fault situation
 
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
you can issue that redetermination on
 
01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
your own as an office but also if
 
01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
someone takes temporary jobs as their
 
01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
unemployed technically you know that
 
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
often results in a redetermination
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
especially if the rate is different with
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
a different employer
 
01:36:34.129 --> 01:36:34.139 align:start position:0%
okay that's I see where you're going now
 
01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
um so what happens is so New Hampshire
 
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
allows individuals to have part-time
 
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
work and part-time earnings while
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
they're collecting unemployment benefits
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
um you can't be working full-time and we
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
and there is a limit to what you can
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
earn and still receive an unemployment
 
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
benefit so what's required of everybody
 
01:36:53.450 --> 01:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
um when they are filing for unemployment
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
on that weekly claim they answer the
 
01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
questions as to whether they are whether
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
they worked during the week claimed and
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
what they had for earnings during that
 
01:37:04.129 --> 01:37:04.139 align:start position:0%
week claimed we then take those reported
 
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
earnings and they may or may not
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
function as an offset against your
 
01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount so you're allowed
 
01:37:14.570 --> 01:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
to earn 30 of your weekly benefit amount
 
01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
without it impacting your weekly benefit
 
01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:19.860 align:start position:0%
amount anything above 30 percent then
 
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
functions as a dollar for dollar draw
 
01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
down on your weekly benefit amount that
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
calculation gets done your weekly
 
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
benefit amount that rate doesn't change
 
01:37:32.689 --> 01:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
but for that particular earlier week
 
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
that you had earnings it would be the
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
the check you receive could be less and
 
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
it would be calculated based upon what
 
01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
you had in earnings anything over 30
 
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
percent would be a dollar for dollar
 
01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:49.430 align:start position:0%
percent would be a dollar for dollar
drop

01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
ped

01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
um what else I'm sorry if I didn't
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
entirely agree and I
 
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
um understand if someone takes a
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
temporary job for a week or two and then
 
01:38:05.810 --> 01:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
is unemployed again it doesn't that
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
amount for those two weeks impact their
 
01:38:12.729 --> 01:38:12.739 align:start position:0%
new create a new rate of unemployment
 
01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
it does not create a new rate the your
 
01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
rate is purely a function of the
 
01:38:19.970 --> 01:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
earnings that you had during your base
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
period so your base period is the first
 
01:38:26.330 --> 01:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
four uh completed quarters of the last
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
five okay so that those are the earnings
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
that we look at for calculating out your
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount now the part-time
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
job that you take the earnings from that
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
can influence your weekly benefit amount
 
01:38:40.850 --> 01:38:40.860 align:start position:0%
based on the calculation I just reviewed
 
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
also if you have a disqualifying
 
01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
separation from that job that you take
 
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
that can also impact your ongoing
 
01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
eligibility for benefits as well that
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you
 
01:38:58.850 --> 01:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
very much gentlemen I appreciate
 
01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
um Representatives you can always uh you
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
have their business cards you can always
 
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
call them if you have any uh particular
 
01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:05.030 align:start position:0%
call them if you have any uh particular
questions

01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
um we're going to take a three or four
 
01:39:10.610 --> 01:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
minute break just so people can go to
 
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
the bathroom or not and then come back
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh gentlemen if you'd like to approach
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
approach the bench and uh we'll be right
 
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
with you in a couple minutes because Mom
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:32.510 align:start position:0%
 
equipment

01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:36.050 align:start position:0%
 
happy

01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
birthday yeah there is because of what
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
he was saying we were unemployed for a
 
01:39:43.729 --> 01:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
long time but this incentive to take a
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're gonna get started folks if you can
 
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
take your seats
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:45.659 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Ogden welcome
 
01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative infantine and
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
thanks for asking us to come over and
 
01:46:51.050 --> 01:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
speak so uh representative infantine had
 
01:46:52.970 --> 01:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
called us last week and said uh that
 
01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
there'd be some benefit uh perhaps of
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
the apartment coming over and doing a
 
01:46:58.609 --> 01:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
little bit of an operational overview of
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
what the department does looking around
 
01:47:02.330 --> 01:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
the room and speaking with you a couple
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
of you I know that some of you know
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
everything that we do and have been
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
around and seen what the Department's up
 
01:47:10.850 --> 01:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
to longer than even I have uh that being
 
01:47:12.410 --> 01:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
said I think it's always a good and
 
01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
welcome opportunity to sit down and talk
 
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
and say what we do maybe talk a little
 
01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
bit about what we don't do
 
01:47:20.209 --> 01:47:20.219 align:start position:0%
um but then also happy to take any
 
01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
questions I did walk around and just put
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
a very simple handout
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
um that's more to keep us ordered and to
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
keep making sure that I hit all of the
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
points or the issues that we wanted to
 
01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
raise just in terms of what we're going
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
to do we're going to walk through the
 
01:47:36.770 --> 01:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
operation of the Department of Labor
 
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
chiefly we're going to talk about the
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
two divisions we have a Workers
 
01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
Compensation Division we have an
 
01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
inspection division we have a hearings
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
Bureau and then we have the
 
01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
Administration or Office of the
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner again when we talk about
 
01:47:51.410 --> 01:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor and workers
 
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
compensation really what we're talking
 
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
about is the department administers and
 
01:47:56.570 --> 01:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
regulates the workers compensation
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
system in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:48:01.370 --> 01:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
that's an all-involved type of task and
 
01:48:03.169 --> 01:48:03.179 align:start position:0%
what I mean by that is we do everything
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
from working with employers and carriers
 
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure that coverage is in place
 
01:48:09.410 --> 01:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
that's something that we always like to
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
highlight that it's a requirement in New
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that if an employer has even
 
01:48:15.649 --> 01:48:15.659 align:start position:0%
one person working part-time that
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
employer needs workers compensation
 
01:48:19.609 --> 01:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
coverage that workers compensation
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
coverage needs to be secured through a
 
01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
carrier who then reports that to the
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
department in terms of how coverage is
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
reported to the department I don't want
 
01:48:30.290 --> 01:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
to bore folks with that but I do want to
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
just highlight essentially workers
 
01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
compensation coverage is reported to the
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
department through ncci workers
 
01:48:38.689 --> 01:48:38.699 align:start position:0%
compensation carriers they
 
01:48:41.450 --> 01:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
electronically submit their policies to
 
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
ncci and then those policies or ncci
 
01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
then submits to the department based
 
01:48:48.169 --> 01:48:48.179 align:start position:0%
basically every day a data feed saying
 
01:48:50.209 --> 01:48:50.219 align:start position:0%
okay this is the reporting we have on
 
01:48:53.570 --> 01:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
coverage we work with employers and what
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
I mean by that is we have ways in which
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
we say Okay an employer is now reporting
 
01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
employees to Employment Security and
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
they don't have workers compensation
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
coverage on file so that it might
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
initiate contact or a call from the
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
Department we also sometimes look into
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
issues where we see coverage has fallen
 
01:49:13.370 --> 01:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
off so if we have an employer that has
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
always held coverage in New Hampshire
 
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
and then for whatever reason their
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
coverage falls off we would reach out to
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
them again the reason for coverage is
 
01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
very important without coverage those
 
01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
costs can be quite significant and they
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
actually can be held personally against
 
01:49:30.169 --> 01:49:30.179 align:start position:0%
the employer additionally and more
 
01:49:31.970 --> 01:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
importantly without coverage you have
 
01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
instances in which the injured worker if
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
they have medical bills or if there's a
 
01:49:38.570 --> 01:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
period of Indemnity there's the
 
01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
potential for those to not be able uh to
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
be covered or paid for because again the
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
cost can sometimes become pretty
 
01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:46.070 align:start position:0%
cost can sometimes become pretty
astronomical

01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
astronomical
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
in addition to coverage through workers
 
01:49:49.970 --> 01:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
compensation carriers or insurance
 
01:49:53.649 --> 01:49:53.659 align:start position:0%
companies we also regulate and permit
 
01:49:55.970 --> 01:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
self-insurance for purposes of workers
 
01:49:57.770 --> 01:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
compensation it's something that
 
01:49:59.450 --> 01:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
oftentimes I don't think comes up too
 
01:50:01.129 --> 01:50:01.139 align:start position:0%
often in this committee but workers
 
01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
compensation self-insurance that's under
 
01:50:06.649 --> 01:50:06.659 align:start position:0%
RSA 281 a5a and what you're talking
 
01:50:08.930 --> 01:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
about there is that employers in New
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or groups of employers in New
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they have the option of saying
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
that they want to self-insure for
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
workers comp they say they can actually
 
01:50:19.010 --> 01:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
provided that they have sufficient
 
01:50:20.930 --> 01:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
financials and are able to demonstrate
 
01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
certain things they can essentially say
 
01:50:25.550 --> 01:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
that they will pay for workers
 
01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
compensation through self-insurance as
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to securing a carrier or a
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
policy rather with a carrier workers
 
01:50:35.209 --> 01:50:35.219 align:start position:0%
compensation self-insurance again I
 
01:50:36.530 --> 01:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
reference the fact that there can be
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
groups of employers so you have some
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
individual employers that are big enough
 
01:50:42.169 --> 01:50:42.179 align:start position:0%
and have the financial wherewithal to do
 
01:50:45.169 --> 01:50:45.179 align:start position:0%
it on their own you also have groups of
 
01:50:47.689 --> 01:50:47.699 align:start position:0%
employers and in New Hampshire the
 
01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
system or program calls for them to be
 
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
homogeneous so you could have a we for
 
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
instance we have a lumber Industries
 
01:50:55.729 --> 01:50:55.739 align:start position:0%
group and what this is is it's a group
 
01:50:57.590 --> 01:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
of lumber companies or companies
 
01:51:00.050 --> 01:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
associated with the lumber trade or
 
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
Lumber industry who've come together in
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
a group and they actually go out and
 
01:51:06.169 --> 01:51:06.179 align:start position:0%
hire a third party administrator they
 
01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
get bonding they do other things and
 
01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
essentially they set up a workers
 
01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
compensation coverage program again
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
self-insured for the benefit of the
 
01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
subscribing members
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
the next bullet you'll see is talking
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
about peos or professional employer
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
organizations sometimes it's referred to
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
as Employer leasing employee leasing
 
01:51:26.209 --> 01:51:26.219 align:start position:0%
employee leasing is a term that a lot of
 
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
folks don't like nowadays but it still
 
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
sometimes referred to as that these are
 
01:51:32.090 --> 01:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
organizations where it's essentially a
 
01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
co-employment model where you might have
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
an entity that works with workers and
 
01:51:39.590 --> 01:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason they decide well
 
01:51:41.090 --> 01:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
they no longer want to be necessarily
 
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
the employer of record they want people
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
doing work for them but they want to
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
kind of offshore the payroll processes
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
and the benefits processes and things of
 
01:51:51.050 --> 01:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
that nature and there are actually
 
01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
companies out there these peos that they
 
01:51:56.689 --> 01:51:56.699 align:start position:0%
provide those types of services ADP is a
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
big one of these ADP provides a whole
 
01:52:00.649 --> 01:52:00.659 align:start position:0%
umbrella of services but one of the
 
01:52:03.169 --> 01:52:03.179 align:start position:0%
things a company like ADP will do is
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
they will provide uh you know peo
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
Services the Department of Labor we
 
01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
license POS or permit peos in this state
 
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
diverse reports of injury when people
 
01:52:14.330 --> 01:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
hear about workers compensation
 
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
obviously and unfortunately I think they
 
01:52:17.810 --> 01:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
most often think so think of folks
 
01:52:20.030 --> 01:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
getting hurt and really the first report
 
01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:21.719 align:start position:0%
of injury Point that's something very
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
important that the department does on an
 
01:52:25.250 --> 01:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
annual basis we typically receive
 
01:52:28.010 --> 01:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
reporting of over 40 000 workplace
 
01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
injuries now these workplace injuries
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
are not all horrific because again
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
employers should be reporting all
 
01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
injuries whether
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
um you know it's something that you know
 
01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:38.820 align:start position:0%
is is significant requiring Hospital
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
time over at something more minor but
 
01:52:43.010 --> 01:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
again on an annualized basis we're
 
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
typically receiving first reports of
 
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
injury of over 40 000 reports a year
 
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
something that sometimes comes up with
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
first reports of injury so if we look at
 
01:52:55.129 --> 01:52:55.139 align:start position:0%
the statute 281 a53 it's talking about
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
there is a timeliness component to that
 
01:52:59.390 --> 01:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
these injury reports are supposed to be
 
01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
filed Timely
 
01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
basically within five days if they're
 
01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
not file timely the department will
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
follow up I would note that the
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
obligation ultimately rests with the
 
01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
employer that being said most employers
 
01:53:14.209 --> 01:53:14.219 align:start position:0%
as I referenced earlier they have a
 
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
carrier they have an insurance carrier
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
that they've contracted with and the
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
carrier is oftentimes the one that's
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
reporting those injuries but I would
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
point out that if there's a problem in
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
the reporting we ultimately do go to the
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
employer and say hey this needs to be
 
01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
corrected this is something that you
 
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
need to look at
 
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
um claims it's kind of an all-inclusive
 
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
term and what I mean by that is we have
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
a claims unit at the Department of Labor
 
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's essentially tasked with uh
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
administering uh the benefit sections of
 
01:53:44.810 --> 01:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
281a and what I mean by that is if there
 
01:53:46.850 --> 01:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
is a claim so again I said when I said
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
we get 40 000 reports of injury not all
 
01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
of those ripen into claims I would say
 
01:53:54.109 --> 01:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of injuries that
 
01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:56.340 align:start position:0%
reported they end up not ripening
 
01:53:58.189 --> 01:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
ripening into claims where there's
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
Indemnity or medical or anything like
 
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
that but those that do become claims
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
those have to be administered and what I
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
mean by administered is throughout 281a
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
there are certain requirements that the
 
01:54:10.729 --> 01:54:10.739 align:start position:0%
carrier you know the carriers on the
 
01:54:13.490 --> 01:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
hook for certain things the employees on
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
the hook to do certain things in terms
 
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
of providing medical information and
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
other things of that nature and our
 
01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:21.719 align:start position:0%
claims unit works with folks both the
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
carriers the employers and the Injured
 
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
Workers in order to make sure that
 
01:54:28.250 --> 01:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
things are properly administered
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
the next Point you'd have is dispute
 
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
resolution one of the things that I
 
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
think that we're most proud of over the
 
01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
last few years that we've done is we've
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
actually put in place someone who works
 
01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
full-time as a dispute resolution
 
01:54:44.229 --> 01:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
coordinator if you look at RSA 281 a42
 
01:54:46.729 --> 01:54:46.739 align:start position:0%
it talks about the fact that the
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
Department's going to have on staff
 
01:54:51.290 --> 01:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
someone that can assist Pro Se or
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
Injured Workers and when I say assist
 
01:54:55.609 --> 01:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
this person in this position is actually
 
01:54:58.250 --> 01:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
set up to fully work with Pro Se
 
01:55:00.169 --> 01:55:00.179 align:start position:0%
employees those who are not represented
 
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
by an attorney and help them walk
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
through the system and get information
 
01:55:06.169 --> 01:55:06.179 align:start position:0%
and that's something that we've really
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
we've done over the last two years the
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
person we have in that position now it's
 
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
a full-time position and we've gotten a
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
lot of good feedback from Injured
 
01:55:17.689 --> 01:55:17.699 align:start position:0%
Workers if even from carriers because
 
01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
the person in this position sometimes
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's not always about fighting sometimes
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
it's about just getting people
 
01:55:24.590 --> 01:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
communicating and getting people on the
 
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
same page and understanding what
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
conversation should be happening
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
um when I talk about dispute resolution
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately If things cannot be resolved
 
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
sometimes they will go to hearings
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
so I'll talk a little bit about our
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
hearings Bureau on a broader basis but
 
01:55:42.649 --> 01:55:42.659 align:start position:0%
uh through workers compensation we do
 
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 1200 to 1800 hearings a
 
01:55:47.810 --> 01:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
year and what I mean by hearings is
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
these are actual issues in which there's
 
01:55:52.729 --> 01:55:52.739 align:start position:0%
ultimately been a dispute whether it be
 
01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
that the worker wants to assert benefits
 
01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
or that there's been a denial from the
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
carrier if they're not able to come to
 
01:56:01.609 --> 01:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
some type of agreement or accommodation
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
on those types of things it could
 
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
actually go to a full-fledged formal
 
01:56:07.070 --> 01:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
hearing where the parties would sit in
 
01:56:09.169 --> 01:56:09.179 align:start position:0%
front of a hearings officer they'd put
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
forth what their what their case is and
 
01:56:13.609 --> 01:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
then the department ultimately issues a
 
01:56:16.010 --> 01:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
decision in addition to hearings on what
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
we would call a first level Hearing in
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
front of a departmental hearings officer
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
where administratively attached to the
 
01:56:23.570 --> 01:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals board or the
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals board is
 
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
department and the compensation appeals
 
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
board serves as a secondary level to
 
01:56:32.450 --> 01:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
basically if there's been a first level
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
hearing after which one of the parties
 
01:56:36.890 --> 01:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
feels grieved they can then appeal that
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
to the compensation appeals board the
 
01:56:41.450 --> 01:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals board is set up of
 
01:56:43.209 --> 01:56:43.219 align:start position:0%
33 members where you have 11
 
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
representatives from labor 11
 
01:56:48.590 --> 01:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
representatives from employers and then
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
11 employers or carriers and then 11
 
01:56:52.729 --> 01:56:52.739 align:start position:0%
representatives from neutrals and those
 
01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
are essentially attorneys who typically
 
01:56:56.930 --> 01:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
chair the panels and would assist in
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
writing the decision
 
01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
after the compensation appeals board
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
renders a decision and those are de novo
 
01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
hearings and that's something that I
 
01:57:06.649 --> 01:57:06.659 align:start position:0%
point out because sometimes folks will
 
01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
have an appeal at the first level and
 
01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
they'll be unsatisfied if you appeal it
 
01:57:12.649 --> 01:57:12.659 align:start position:0%
to the compensation appeals board it is
 
01:57:14.689 --> 01:57:14.699 align:start position:0%
a de novo hearing meaning that it starts
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
Anew and the parties have a fresh
 
01:57:19.850 --> 01:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity to dispute the case if
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a still appeals uh coming from
 
01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
the compensation appeals boards those
 
01:57:25.729 --> 01:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
actually go up to the Supreme Court
 
01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing I would reference
 
01:57:29.450 --> 01:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
relative to workers compensation or our
 
01:57:31.129 --> 01:57:31.139 align:start position:0%
administration of the system is our
 
01:57:32.930 --> 01:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
administration of funds there's a very
 
01:57:35.810 --> 01:57:35.820 align:start position:0%
second injury fund if you look at RSA
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
281 a55 the second injury fund is this
 
01:57:39.119 --> 01:57:40.310 align:start position:0%
281 a55 the second injury fund is this
program

01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
um it's basically our evolving fund
 
01:57:44.209 --> 01:57:44.219 align:start position:0%
where it's not it's not money that's
 
01:57:46.370 --> 01:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
come in and held by the department for
 
01:57:48.169 --> 01:57:48.179 align:start position:0%
the departmental purposes essentially
 
01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
the second injury fund is this fund that
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
has been set up to say that if in an
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
instance you have an employee who
 
01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
suffered a second injury so they had a
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
period a first injury for which there
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
was a period of disability and then
 
01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
through their work they have then a
 
01:58:05.689 --> 01:58:05.699 align:start position:0%
second injury the second injury fund
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
basically says that the uh carrier or
 
01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
employer whose uh basically paying
 
01:58:14.689 --> 01:58:14.699 align:start position:0%
compensation or benefits for that second
 
01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
injury second injury they would perhaps
 
01:58:19.609 --> 01:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
be entitled to seek reimbursement from
 
01:58:21.410 --> 01:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
the second injury fund it's some way of
 
01:58:24.649 --> 01:58:24.659 align:start position:0%
mitigating what might be uh exacerbated
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
costs for a second injury the second
 
01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
injury fund again when I say it's a
 
01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
revolving fund what we do is we take in
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
the request for second injury fund
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement on an annualized basis
 
01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
once we have those requests come into
 
01:58:39.530 --> 01:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
the department if we say that that
 
01:58:41.209 --> 01:58:41.219 align:start position:0%
number and it can be pretty significant
 
01:58:43.250 --> 01:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
it could be upwards of the highest that
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
it's been since I've been there as there
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
was a year that it was around 20 million
 
01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:47.890 align:start position:0%
was a year that it was around 20 million
dollars

01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:47.900 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
when those uh when we say that there
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
might be upwards of 20 million dollars
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh in in reimbursement we then put out
 
01:58:58.430 --> 01:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
an assessment that is uh paid by workers
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
compensation carriers writing in the
 
01:59:03.050 --> 01:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that they're
 
01:59:05.089 --> 01:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
assessed on a pro-rata basis meaning the
 
01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
percentage of payouts that they uh
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
issued in workers comp on this for the
 
01:59:12.050 --> 01:59:12.060 align:start position:0%
State uh that would be their
 
01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
attributable amount for these assess for
 
01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
this assessment the money then comes
 
01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
back into the department the department
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
then disperse disperses that money to
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
the carriers seeking reimbursement so
 
01:59:23.629 --> 01:59:23.639 align:start position:0%
that's why I said it's a revolving fund
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's not something it's the 20 million
 
01:59:27.290 --> 01:59:27.300 align:start position:0%
dollars it doesn't hit the Department's
 
01:59:29.689 --> 01:59:29.699 align:start position:0%
budget in terms of departmental
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures it's instead a revolving
 
01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
fund that we assessed
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
um and pay out of uh for again
 
01:59:38.030 --> 01:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for second injury funds
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
the other is the administration fund the
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor's finances we are a
 
01:59:45.229 --> 01:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
general fund contributor and what I mean
 
01:59:47.089 --> 01:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
by that is we do not draw on General
 
01:59:50.209 --> 01:59:50.219 align:start position:0%
funds we used and utilize no General
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
funds our uh the Department's finances
 
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
are instead driven by two Revenue
 
01:59:57.229 --> 01:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
sources the first is referenced here is
 
01:59:59.570 --> 01:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
the administration fund and essentially
 
02:00:01.490 --> 02:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
what the department does is for its
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
costs of administering the workers
 
02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
compensation chapter we uh come up with
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
a number of okay that's what that costs
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
and again there is then an assessment of
 
02:00:12.169 --> 02:00:12.179 align:start position:0%
the workers compensation carriers
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
writing in New Hampshire and they pay
 
02:00:17.589 --> 02:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
their Pro rat a share the other
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue source is the restricted fund
 
02:00:21.709 --> 02:00:21.719 align:start position:0%
and the restricted fund is made up of
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
all revenue that the department collects
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
through its fines fees licenses and
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
things of that nature not to bore you
 
02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
with it but how essentially the
 
02:00:32.270 --> 02:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
department does its finances as we take
 
02:00:34.189 --> 02:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
in the administration fund we we take in
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
the restricted fund we then pay
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
everything we have to pay in terms of
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
salaries expenditures all of those
 
02:00:42.169 --> 02:00:42.179 align:start position:0%
things whatever is left over then goes
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund
 
02:00:47.450 --> 02:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
um as basically a contribution
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
the last thing I've listed relative to
 
02:00:52.609 --> 02:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
workers compensation is uh Daniel Albert
 
02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
is the current director of workers comp
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
and I've put her name in number
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
Danielle's work for the Department
 
02:01:00.169 --> 02:01:00.179 align:start position:0%
almost as long as I have about 10 years
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
she's been a hearing officer she's been
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
one of our attorneys and now she's the
 
02:01:04.970 --> 02:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
director of workers comp I just
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
highlight her to you as a great resource
 
02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I encourage you if you have workers
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
comp questions if you have constituents
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
who have workers comp questions anything
 
02:01:16.010 --> 02:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
of that nature feel free to reach out to
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
her really at any time and like I said
 
02:01:20.450 --> 02:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
we'll work to get you answers on those
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
issues sometimes workers comp can be
 
02:01:24.890 --> 02:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
pretty cumbersome I do know there are
 
02:01:26.689 --> 02:01:26.699 align:start position:0%
folks who you know it's a time where
 
02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
they're in a vulnerable place and when
 
02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
they get denials they get very upset and
 
02:01:32.810 --> 02:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
it's oftentimes hard to then look and
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
say okay how do I navigate this system
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
when do I submit things how do I submit
 
02:01:38.810 --> 02:01:38.820 align:start position:0%
things what do I need to submit we're
 
02:01:41.089 --> 02:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
happy to walk through walk folks through
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
all of that additionally it's not just
 
02:01:45.709 --> 02:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
Injured Workers we're happy to work with
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're happy to work with the employers
 
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
and as well and the carriers again it
 
02:01:51.050 --> 02:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
truly is one of those situations in
 
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
which everyone needs to understand what
 
02:01:54.890 --> 02:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
the requirements are and it always works
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
better if people understand those things
 
02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
and there's good communication and
 
02:02:01.070 --> 02:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
conversation around it
 
02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
as I said we're principally made up of
 
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
two divisions the inspect the workers
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
comp division the second is the
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division the Inspection
 
02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
Division A lot of times I think what
 
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
people traditionally think of when they
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
think of Departments of Labor the
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division has a couple of
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
primary focuses the first is wage an
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
hour wage and hour is what we refer to
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
and we talk about really our inspection
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
activities relative to employers it's
 
02:02:28.669 --> 02:02:28.679 align:start position:0%
what you think about when you think
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
about are people getting paid on time
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
are they being paid in full are they
 
02:02:35.330 --> 02:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
being paid properly in terms of the
 
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
statutes that we administer there's this
 
02:02:41.149 --> 02:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
overarching around RSA 275 is protective
 
02:02:41.159 --> 02:02:42.530 align:start position:0%
overarching around RSA 275 is protective
legislation

02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
if you look at RSA 275 that's really
 
02:02:47.570 --> 02:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
talking about the payment parameters in
 
02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:49.739 align:start position:0%
terms of again when someone has to be
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
paid the form and format of payment it
 
02:02:54.109 --> 02:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
also talks about some of the other
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
protective measures that are in place
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
relative to you know people being paid
 
02:03:00.169 --> 02:03:00.179 align:start position:0%
in a certain way people
 
02:03:02.089 --> 02:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
um having certain requirements related
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
to if you're you know when you can
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
prorate a salary things of that nature
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
so that's RSA 275 RSA 279 is what we
 
02:03:12.850 --> 02:03:12.860 align:start position:0%
call New Hampshire's minimum wage law
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
for those folks that don't know and I
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
think most of you do but New Hampshire
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an exact minimum wage in
 
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
the sense so New Hampshire has not
 
02:03:22.910 --> 02:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
identified its own minimum wage instead
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
what New Hampshire does through our say
 
02:03:27.310 --> 02:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
279 is it tracks to the federally
 
02:03:30.350 --> 02:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
stated minimum wage additionally I
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
always point out when we talk about
 
02:03:33.649 --> 02:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
minimum wage law the Department of Labor
 
02:03:35.390 --> 02:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
does not actually deal with a lot of
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
instances in which folks are being paid
 
02:03:38.930 --> 02:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
less than minimum wage and I would say
 
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
most employees we actually deal with are
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
being paid well in and in addition to
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
what minimum wages are minimum wage
 
02:03:48.649 --> 02:03:48.659 align:start position:0%
issues chiefly relate to if you look at
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
RSA 279 26b or 21 uh where it's talking
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
about tipped Wages that's where most of
 
02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
the issues come up when we're talking
 
02:04:01.609 --> 02:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
about RSA 279 because the tipped laws or
 
02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
laws related to tipped employees they
 
02:04:08.209 --> 02:04:08.219 align:start position:0%
fall under RSA 279 so to be clear we
 
02:04:09.890 --> 02:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
don't see a lot of minimum wage issues
 
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
in terms of people not being paid
 
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
minimum wage we do though come across
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
quite a number of issues related to how
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
tips are handled or mishandled
 
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
um youth labor is under RSA 276 a
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
um the thing I always highlight when I
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
talk about youth labor to folks is
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
there's really two categories in New
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you have
 
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
um anyone so you a lot of times you'd
 
02:04:33.890 --> 02:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
say 14 and 15 year olds and then you
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
have 16 and 17 year olds 14 and 15 year
 
02:04:39.790 --> 02:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
olds there's also federal regulations
 
02:04:42.410 --> 02:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
and the Federal Regulations are somewhat
 
02:04:44.450 --> 02:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
or slightly stricter than New
 
02:04:45.790 --> 02:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's law
 
02:04:49.250 --> 02:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
for 16 and 17 year olds there are not
 
02:04:51.649 --> 02:04:51.659 align:start position:0%
federal limitations on hours but there
 
02:04:53.629 --> 02:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
are State limitations so I always point
 
02:04:55.250 --> 02:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
that out to folks is that you're talking
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
about really 16 and 17 14 and 15 and
 
02:05:00.770 --> 02:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
having some awareness of the fact that
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
14 and 15 year olds there's also Federal
 
02:05:05.330 --> 02:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
standards when we're talking about youth
 
02:05:08.089 --> 02:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
labor you're really talking about mainly
 
02:05:10.370 --> 02:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
what can kids do so there's certain
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited occupations we have adopted
 
02:05:15.050 --> 02:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
Federal standards for hazardous orders
 
02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
which essentially say kids cannot do
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
certain things they can in certain
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
instances if they're part of an
 
02:05:22.070 --> 02:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program if they're or
 
02:05:23.570 --> 02:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
part of a vocational learning program
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
but absent that there are certain
 
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
occupations or tasks that youth are
 
02:05:30.770 --> 02:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
strictly prohibited from doing in
 
02:05:32.089 --> 02:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
addition to prohibitions about
 
02:05:34.490 --> 02:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
occupations or tasks they can't do we're
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
really talking about hours we're talking
 
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
about you know kids can only work so
 
02:05:41.450 --> 02:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
many hours in a week so many hours in a
 
02:05:44.810 --> 02:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
day and things of that nature there were
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
legislative changes last session that
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
slightly raised the hours that that
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
youth could work but but again that's
 
02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
something to be aware of and when we're
 
02:05:57.890 --> 02:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
talking about youth labor issues that's
 
02:05:59.330 --> 02:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
really what it is is our kids working
 
02:06:02.689 --> 02:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
too many hours or uh you know doing too
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
many hours during school and things of
 
02:06:07.070 --> 02:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
that nature the only other thing I bring
 
02:06:08.990 --> 02:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
up with youth labor is there are certain
 
02:06:11.450 --> 02:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
documentation requirements so if you're
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
an employer who's hiring 14 and 15 year
 
02:06:16.370 --> 02:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
olds you need a youth certificate form
 
02:06:18.649 --> 02:06:18.659 align:start position:0%
if you're hiring during 16 and 17 year
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
olds you need a parental permission form
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
I also would highlight this is several
 
02:06:26.089 --> 02:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
rounds of several sessions ago but there
 
02:06:27.890 --> 02:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
was a change that allowed parents can
 
02:06:29.689 --> 02:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
now fill out the youth certificate used
 
02:06:31.129 --> 02:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
to have to have been filled out by the
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
school district now parents can fill out
 
02:06:34.850 --> 02:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
the youth certificate so that's just
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
something I point out is that whether
 
02:06:37.850 --> 02:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
it's a youth certificate or whether it's
 
02:06:39.950 --> 02:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
a parental permission form parents can
 
02:06:42.050 --> 02:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
fill that out but those are documents
 
02:06:43.970 --> 02:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
that have to be in place at or right
 
02:06:46.609 --> 02:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
around the time of hire for youth
 
02:06:46.619 --> 02:06:47.510 align:start position:0%
around the time of hire for youth
workers

02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
workers
 
02:06:49.729 --> 02:06:49.739 align:start position:0%
the warn act
 
02:06:52.250 --> 02:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
um the Warren actus uh 275 app and
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner capatus who you who you
 
02:06:55.129 --> 02:06:55.139 align:start position:0%
just saw he's the commissioner of
 
02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
Employment Security he had previously
 
02:06:58.370 --> 02:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
been the commissioner of Labor and when
 
02:06:59.930 --> 02:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
he was the commissioner of Labor uh
 
02:07:01.609 --> 02:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
bless you when he was the commissioner
 
02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:02.820 align:start position:0%
of Labor he had actually I believe
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
championed the um putting in of the uh
 
02:07:07.850 --> 02:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
the state Warren act the Warren act
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're talking about is
 
02:07:12.050 --> 02:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
if you have a company and it's a defined
 
02:07:13.609 --> 02:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
there's a threshold it has to be an
 
02:07:16.070 --> 02:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
employer of 100 or more but if you have
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
an employer subject to the warn act that
 
02:07:21.890 --> 02:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
is uh engaging in a mass layoff event so
 
02:07:23.570 --> 02:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
if they're hiring a certain threshold
 
02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
number of people or they're closing a
 
02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
facility they need to provide advance
 
02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
notice to those workers and to the
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
department and to the Attorney General's
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
office and to their local Authority and
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
if they don't they could potentially be
 
02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
liable for upwards of 60 days of wages
 
02:07:42.410 --> 02:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
which is essentially that notice period
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
so that's something that comes up from
 
02:07:47.330 --> 02:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
time to time lastly in terms of wage an
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
hour or I would highlight citizens job
 
02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:50.629 align:start position:0%
hour or I would highlight citizens job
protection

02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
protection
 
02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
under 275 a that is the requirement that
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
says that an employer needs to have a
 
02:07:59.209 --> 02:07:59.219 align:start position:0%
certain author they need to basically
 
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
have authorization documentation showing
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
that that individual employee is
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
authorized to work in the in the United
 
02:08:09.649 --> 02:08:09.659 align:start position:0%
States prior to hire the other thing I
 
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
would talk about when I reference
 
02:08:12.770 --> 02:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
citizen job protection sometimes the
 
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
question comes up
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
um about whether that's a penalty
 
02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
against it's not a penalty or there's
 
02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
not penalties against the worker in
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
question this is a requirement that the
 
02:08:25.129 --> 02:08:25.139 align:start position:0%
employer is obligated to look at and say
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay they need the documentation it's
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
not something that's held against the
 
02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:29.870 align:start position:0%
not something that's held against the
worker

02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
worker
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
in addition to wage and hour the
 
02:08:33.770 --> 02:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division administers certain
 
02:08:35.470 --> 02:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
safety programs
 
02:08:40.490 --> 02:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
first RSA 277 is safety or worker safety
 
02:08:42.890 --> 02:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
for public employees one thing I would
 
02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
highlight is we absent what I'll
 
02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
reference below with 281 a64 we have
 
02:08:50.810 --> 02:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
very limited a very limited role
 
02:08:53.209 --> 02:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
relative to worker safety for private
 
02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
employment that is covered by federal
 
02:08:59.450 --> 02:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
OSHA but for public employees those
 
02:09:01.609 --> 02:09:01.619 align:start position:0%
folks who work for cities towns the
 
02:09:04.129 --> 02:09:04.139 align:start position:0%
state things of that nature the
 
02:09:05.689 --> 02:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor has oversight
 
02:09:05.699 --> 02:09:06.970 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor has oversight
Administration

02:09:06.970 --> 02:09:06.980 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
02:09:09.890 --> 02:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
responsibilities relative to enforcing
 
02:09:12.470 --> 02:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
certain safety standards
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
um we conduct inspections
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
um we will follow up and seek
 
02:09:18.109 --> 02:09:18.119 align:start position:0%
remediation and things of that nature
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
under 281 a64 that applies to both
 
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
private and public employers and 28164
 
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
is essentially some fairly
 
02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward safety requirements
 
02:09:30.169 --> 02:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
saying that employees or subject
 
02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
employers who have 15 or more they have
 
02:09:35.089 --> 02:09:35.099 align:start position:0%
to basically 15 or more employees in
 
02:09:37.070 --> 02:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
this state they have to file a safety
 
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
summary form and they have to uh and
 
02:09:41.209 --> 02:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
panel a joint Loss Management committee
 
02:09:43.010 --> 02:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
which is a committee that the employer
 
02:09:45.229 --> 02:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
should make have made up that basically
 
02:09:48.649 --> 02:09:48.659 align:start position:0%
looks at safety issues relative to their
 
02:09:48.659 --> 02:09:50.689 align:start position:0%
looks at safety issues relative to their
operation

02:09:50.689 --> 02:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
operation
 
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
um in addition to wage now or in safety
 
02:09:59.149 --> 02:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
we also under RSA 157a and 157b we have
 
02:10:02.089 --> 02:10:02.099 align:start position:0%
boilers an elevator oversight
 
02:10:05.089 --> 02:10:05.099 align:start position:0%
um these are basically uh not in private
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
instances these are for commercial
 
02:10:09.790 --> 02:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
applications or non-residential
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
again I've put there the point of
 
02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
contact uh Lexi Rojas is the director of
 
02:10:18.050 --> 02:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
the Inspection Division and again
 
02:10:20.330 --> 02:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
questions if your constituents or you
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
have questions relative to those types
 
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
of topics that I've referenced above I
 
02:10:28.189 --> 02:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
encourage you uh to reach out to Lexi
 
02:10:30.410 --> 02:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
one thing I wanted to also bring up
 
02:10:32.330 --> 02:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
relative to inspection because our
 
02:10:34.129 --> 02:10:34.139 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division does get quite a bit
 
02:10:36.109 --> 02:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
of attention and a lot of you know
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
questions because that is the arm of the
 
02:10:40.189 --> 02:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
organization that does conduct our
 
02:10:42.589 --> 02:10:42.599 align:start position:0%
inspections so that's the group that
 
02:10:45.169 --> 02:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
when we have complaints we would go out
 
02:10:47.689 --> 02:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
and do an inspection and I just want to
 
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
talk very briefly about what is
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
inspection entails and then kind of the
 
02:10:53.209 --> 02:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
follow-up from an inspection so
 
02:10:54.530 --> 02:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
essentially as I reference where
 
02:10:57.169 --> 02:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
principally complaint driven we don't
 
02:10:58.850 --> 02:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
have to be we do have the authority
 
02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
under law to go in and and and look at
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
any employer's operation but uh for at
 
02:11:07.010 --> 02:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
least as long as I've been there and I
 
02:11:08.689 --> 02:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
think even decades before the department
 
02:11:10.729 --> 02:11:10.739 align:start position:0%
is complaint driven so essentially we're
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
having people call us and say whether
 
02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
something's happening or not happening
 
02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
and based on what they're saying
 
02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
um you know we try to do some filtering
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of looking okay is this a good
 
02:11:22.970 --> 02:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
complaint I know sometimes folks will
 
02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
say we get bad complaints but we try to
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
do what we can to get to okay is this a
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
valid good faith complaint if we do then
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
we would and do an inspection and
 
02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
basically what an inspection is is we
 
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
would send one of our compliance folks
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
one of our labor inspectors they would
 
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
visit the employer they'll give a notice
 
02:11:42.410 --> 02:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
saying okay this is what I'm looking for
 
02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of documentation and then based
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
on what they're given via documentation
 
02:11:48.770 --> 02:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
based on what they're hearing being
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
employee interviews or interviews with
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
the employees and employers ultimately
 
02:11:54.830 --> 02:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is coming back with
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
findings and saying hey whether they
 
02:11:58.370 --> 02:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
feel there's been a violation whether
 
02:12:00.169 --> 02:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
there's been no violations
 
02:12:02.589 --> 02:12:02.599 align:start position:0%
if there are violations there are
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes penalties relative to
 
02:12:06.649 --> 02:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
penalties and I'll talk about this in a
 
02:12:07.970 --> 02:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
bit when I'm talking about our hearings
 
02:12:10.729 --> 02:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
Bureau but prior to penalties being
 
02:12:13.729 --> 02:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
issued RSA 27311 actually specifically
 
02:12:16.330 --> 02:12:16.340 align:start position:0%
calls out that absent certain violations
 
02:12:19.609 --> 02:12:19.619 align:start position:0%
employers are entitled to a warning and
 
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
what I mean by that is that it's not
 
02:12:22.850 --> 02:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
something where it's looking to be a
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
gotcha if we do an inspection and the
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
employer has not yet had a warning
 
02:12:29.810 --> 02:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
unless it's one of these certain topics
 
02:12:31.609 --> 02:12:31.619 align:start position:0%
such as non-payment where they're not
 
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
entitled to a warning the employer would
 
02:12:37.129 --> 02:12:37.139 align:start position:0%
get a warning we then have an
 
02:12:38.570 --> 02:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the parties again the
 
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
parties being the department and the
 
02:12:41.689 --> 02:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
employer to settle out and basically go
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
say what is the compliance concern if
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
there is one how does the employer come
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
into the compliance if there's penalties
 
02:12:49.129 --> 02:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
we can work on the penalties we are
 
02:12:50.689 --> 02:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
seeking the full payment of the wages
 
02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
and what I mean by that is if we do an
 
02:12:55.129 --> 02:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
inspection and we find that money is
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
owed to employees we're not looking to
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
reduce and will not reduce wages we will
 
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
work with employers on penalties but the
 
02:13:05.810 --> 02:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
hearings Bureau so as I said we have our
 
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division Our Workers
 
02:13:12.169 --> 02:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
Compensation Division we then have our
 
02:13:13.550 --> 02:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
hearings Bureau that I just want to
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
highlight and what I'm highlighting
 
02:13:16.850 --> 02:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
there is the fact that essentially as I
 
02:13:19.370 --> 02:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
said earlier the department you know
 
02:13:21.229 --> 02:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
ultimately a lot of what we do if we're
 
02:13:22.729 --> 02:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
not able to come to some type of
 
02:13:24.890 --> 02:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
agreement or settlement or parties or
 
02:13:26.569 --> 02:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
not able to come type some type of
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
agreement or settlement that can
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
ultimately result in a hearing and in
 
02:13:33.290 --> 02:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
our hearings Bureau is the is the arm of
 
02:13:34.490 --> 02:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
the organization that essentially
 
02:13:37.069 --> 02:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
processes those hearings we have workers
 
02:13:39.050 --> 02:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
compensation hearings those are
 
02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
happening basically Monday through
 
02:13:41.639 --> 02:13:42.669 align:start position:0%
happening basically Monday through
Friday

02:13:42.669 --> 02:13:42.679 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
02:13:45.229 --> 02:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
where essentially parties not the
 
02:13:47.149 --> 02:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
department but parties whether it be an
 
02:13:49.129 --> 02:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
employer or their carrier in the injured
 
02:13:51.169 --> 02:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
worker they're coming in and sitting in
 
02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
front of a hearings officer to deal with
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
their with their disputes relative to
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
the payment of benefits the payment of
 
02:14:00.589 --> 02:14:00.599 align:start position:0%
medical bills things of that nature we
 
02:14:02.810 --> 02:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
also hear wage claims
 
02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
um I will point out relative to wage
 
02:14:06.410 --> 02:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
claims that wage claims are not
 
02:14:07.550 --> 02:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
something that's brought on the
 
02:14:09.530 --> 02:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
Department's own motion employees in
 
02:14:11.330 --> 02:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
this state actually have the individual
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
right to on their own motion say that
 
02:14:16.129 --> 02:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
they feel that they're owed money they
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
can file a wage claim with the
 
02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
Department if they file a wage claim
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
with us what we do with that is we then
 
02:14:23.209 --> 02:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
turn around and give that to the
 
02:14:25.609 --> 02:14:25.619 align:start position:0%
employer and say okay employer uh you
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
know Joe or Jane Smith has filed this
 
02:14:30.890 --> 02:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
wage claim do you object to it if they
 
02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
object we then go back to the claimant
 
02:14:34.129 --> 02:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
say do you want to proceed with the
 
02:14:36.649 --> 02:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
hearing if they don't object and they
 
02:14:38.330 --> 02:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
don't answer at all we would say to the
 
02:14:39.649 --> 02:14:39.659 align:start position:0%
claimant do you want to proceed with the
 
02:14:41.689 --> 02:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
hearing the parties can then have a
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
hearing uh ultimately which there could
 
02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
be an order for payment essentially
 
02:14:47.569 --> 02:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
saying if there's wages owed there could
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
be a enforceable order for payment we
 
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
also under RSA 275e we process
 
02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
whistleblower claims so if a
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
whistleblower in the state of New
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wants to assert certain rights
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
they can file a whistleblower claim with
 
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
the department they can also take those
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
claims to Superior Court but they can
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
file them with the Department of Labor
 
02:15:10.010 --> 02:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
additionally and as I referenced earlier
 
02:15:11.810 --> 02:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
relative to our inspection activities
 
02:15:14.569 --> 02:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
there is sometimes based on what we do
 
02:15:17.089 --> 02:15:17.099 align:start position:0%
or what we see or don't see there can be
 
02:15:19.370 --> 02:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
civil penalties if we have civil
 
02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
penalties we ultimately to enforce those
 
02:15:24.169 --> 02:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
would have to go to a hearing the
 
02:15:26.089 --> 02:15:26.099 align:start position:0%
hearing is an opportunity for the the
 
02:15:28.609 --> 02:15:28.619 align:start position:0%
parties to put their cases forward and
 
02:15:30.169 --> 02:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
ultimately again there could be an order
 
02:15:32.450 --> 02:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
for payment of penalties if there's a
 
02:15:35.330 --> 02:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
violation found I've also put here the
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
hearings and rules administrator Sarah
 
02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
Fuller her contact information again if
 
02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
you if you yourself or your constituents
 
02:15:44.689 --> 02:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
have questions about hearings that are
 
02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
either happening or not happening at the
 
02:15:48.850 --> 02:15:48.860 align:start position:0%
department you could certainly reach out
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
to Sarah
 
02:15:53.689 --> 02:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
and then lastly just in terms of points
 
02:15:55.970 --> 02:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
of contact I'm just putting uh my name
 
02:15:57.169 --> 02:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
and number
 
02:15:58.370 --> 02:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
um in the commissioner's name and number
 
02:16:00.530 --> 02:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
I've worked with most of you before I'm
 
02:16:02.209 --> 02:16:02.219 align:start position:0%
always happy to take questions anytime
 
02:16:04.010 --> 02:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
anyone calls we work to get folks
 
02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
answers quickly if I don't know the
 
02:16:07.970 --> 02:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
answer will work to get someone who does
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
know the answer
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
um next to me is Wes Gardner he's our
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
general counsel also very responsive and
 
02:16:14.689 --> 02:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
then commissioner Merrifield who
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately couldn't be here today but
 
02:16:17.450 --> 02:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
commissioner Merrifield also very
 
02:16:19.069 --> 02:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
responsive always happy to hear from
 
02:16:21.530 --> 02:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
folks and like I said we really are
 
02:16:23.450 --> 02:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing from folks hearing
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
what their concerns are I know several
 
02:16:27.050 --> 02:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
of you on the committee we have worked
 
02:16:28.910 --> 02:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
with in different capacities in terms of
 
02:16:31.010 --> 02:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
concerns have come up constituent
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
concerns have come up so we're always
 
02:16:34.730 --> 02:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
happy to work through those things at
 
02:16:36.830 --> 02:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
any time so I know that that was a lot
 
02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
very quickly but I just wanted to kind
 
02:16:40.810 --> 02:16:40.820 align:start position:0%
of again highlight some of what we do
 
02:16:43.310 --> 02:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
the only other thing I point out is to
 
02:16:44.690 --> 02:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
always be aware of is there's certain
 
02:16:47.389 --> 02:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
things like I said we don't do the U.S
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor handles certain
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
things such as Ada the U US Department
 
02:16:54.650 --> 02:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
of Labor they handle like or you know
 
02:16:57.049 --> 02:16:57.059 align:start position:0%
certain erisa questions
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
um they were already here but Employment
 
02:17:00.650 --> 02:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
Security they handle unemployment so
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
there's certain things we don't do but
 
02:17:03.709 --> 02:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
that's like I said if people call us on
 
02:17:05.209 --> 02:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
those things we'll always be happy to
 
02:17:06.589 --> 02:17:06.599 align:start position:0%
put them in the right direction but I
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
always point out because sometimes it's
 
02:17:09.770 --> 02:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
not you know people are unsatisfied if
 
02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
they call us and we're not able to
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
provide it direct assistance so happy to
 
02:17:16.190 --> 02:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
answer any questions or thoughts or
 
02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:22.310 align:start position:0%
answer any questions or thoughts or
concerns

02:17:22.310 --> 02:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:24.049 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:17:24.049 --> 02:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:25.790 --> 02:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't see a representative
 
02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:28.250 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't see a representative
Sullivan

02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
Sullivan
 
02:17:30.410 --> 02:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
with regard thank you for taking my
 
02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:31.250 align:start position:0%
with regard thank you for taking my
question

02:17:31.250 --> 02:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the inspectors do you
 
02:17:35.150 --> 02:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
have different inspectors for each
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
category or are the cross-trained for
 
02:17:40.849 --> 02:17:40.859 align:start position:0%
doing all kinds of inspections it's
 
02:17:42.650 --> 02:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
different for different categories so we
 
02:17:44.450 --> 02:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
have what we would call wage and hour
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
inspectors and then we have safety
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
inspectors then we have boiler and
 
02:17:51.169 --> 02:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
boiler inspectors and elevator
 
02:17:53.089 --> 02:17:53.099 align:start position:0%
inspectors thank you
 
02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
I would say that there are certain
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
instances in which
 
02:18:00.770 --> 02:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
um a wage and hour inspector might cite
 
02:18:03.469 --> 02:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
a save if they go in and they're seeing
 
02:18:05.929 --> 02:18:05.939 align:start position:0%
that there's uh no joint Loss Management
 
02:18:08.330 --> 02:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
committee they might cite that
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
um so there is some overlap but
 
02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
generally they they're into they're in
 
02:18:15.530 --> 02:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:18.290 --> 02:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh this committee over the years has
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time in independent
 
02:18:25.129 --> 02:18:25.139 align:start position:0%
contractors so I'd be interested to hear
 
02:18:27.530 --> 02:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
um what the progress we've made over the
 
02:18:28.969 --> 02:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
years in terms of reigning that
 
02:18:28.979 --> 02:18:30.410 align:start position:0%
years in terms of reigning that
practicing

02:18:30.410 --> 02:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
practicing
 
02:18:32.330 --> 02:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
no it's a good question there's a lot of
 
02:18:34.490 --> 02:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
work that's gone into that
 
02:18:36.110 --> 02:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
um I will say I think that there are
 
02:18:39.709 --> 02:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
still a lot of problems I will say that
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
in some ways I think the model has
 
02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
changed and what I mean by that is even
 
02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
when I started at the Department of
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
Labor it would be that we went to a job
 
02:18:50.929 --> 02:18:50.939 align:start position:0%
site and it used to be that we were told
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
no none of them are employees they're
 
02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
all independent contractors we're
 
02:18:57.169 --> 02:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
typically not told that anymore the last
 
02:18:59.209 --> 02:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
I want to say four or five years really
 
02:19:00.889 --> 02:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
what we've been told and when I say we
 
02:19:02.450 --> 02:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
the inspectors who've been at the job
 
02:19:02.460 --> 02:19:03.410 align:start position:0%
the inspectors who've been at the job
sites

02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
sites
 
02:19:05.330 --> 02:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
so I've gone to some of the job sites
 
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
and I've been told this as well is now
 
02:19:08.690 --> 02:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
they will tell us oh no they're all
 
02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:10.250 align:start position:0%
they will tell us oh no they're all
employees

02:19:10.250 --> 02:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
and then we'll say Okay Everyone's an
 
02:19:13.610 --> 02:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
employee but then when you follow up
 
02:19:16.129 --> 02:19:16.139 align:start position:0%
with the inspection those employees are
 
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
actually not on payroll uh those
 
02:19:21.530 --> 02:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
employees uh you know are being paid but
 
02:19:22.969 --> 02:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
it might be being paid under the table
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
but I just point that out because the
 
02:19:27.290 --> 02:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
misclassification I think it's it's
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
still a problem it still occurs
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
but I will say that a lot of what we've
 
02:19:35.450 --> 02:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
seen especially relative to it was most
 
02:19:36.650 --> 02:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
often highlighted in the construction
 
02:19:38.209 --> 02:19:38.219 align:start position:0%
industry to be clear it happens
 
02:19:40.250 --> 02:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
elsewhere it happens actually in a lot
 
02:19:41.810 --> 02:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
of Industries there's misclassification
 
02:19:43.849 --> 02:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
but what we've seen especially in
 
02:19:46.009 --> 02:19:46.019 align:start position:0%
construction the last few years is that
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
they're not telling us they're
 
02:19:48.589 --> 02:19:48.599 align:start position:0%
independent contractors they're telling
 
02:19:50.810 --> 02:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
us their employees and then you're
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
chasing after them and it becomes an
 
02:19:55.849 --> 02:19:55.859 align:start position:0%
issue where they're just not properly
 
02:20:01.130 --> 02:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.670 --> 02:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
final question well what uh there has
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
been a um a great deal of
 
02:20:11.090 --> 02:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
expansion around the the issue of remote
 
02:20:15.469 --> 02:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
workers and just uh at first blush it
 
02:20:17.090 --> 02:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that if that presents
 
02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
some challenges for the Department to
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
enforce a variety of laws whether they
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
be safety and health whether they be
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
minimum wage whether they be conditions
 
02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
under which people work uh do you do you
 
02:20:32.450 --> 02:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
have any sense of of Wibble rap with
 
02:20:33.889 --> 02:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
that whole thing and do you think this
 
02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
additional legislation might be needed
 
02:20:37.370 --> 02:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
to deal with the question of remote
 
02:20:39.170 --> 02:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
workers and how they interact with those
 
02:20:39.180 --> 02:20:40.690 align:start position:0%
workers and how they interact with those
systems

02:20:40.690 --> 02:20:40.700 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:20:43.130 --> 02:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
one issue so we've seen it come up
 
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
principally in two areas at least to
 
02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
date I will say that um in workers comp
 
02:20:49.250 --> 02:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of work has been done because
 
02:20:51.530 --> 02:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
there was I think a misunderstanding
 
02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
this might seem incredibly
 
02:20:54.530 --> 02:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
unsophisticated but it's come up enough
 
02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
that I I'll mention it there's been this
 
02:20:58.429 --> 02:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding that if people are
 
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
injured while working at home that
 
02:21:03.170 --> 02:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
basically the workers compensation
 
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
system is like off limits that it's
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
entirely it's a shutout because when
 
02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
you're working at home I so I just we're
 
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
trying to make clear to folks no workers
 
02:21:13.010 --> 02:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
compensation is still at play if someone
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
was injured while at home they could
 
02:21:18.050 --> 02:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
still try and assert a claim I would
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
note that it would be more difficult to
 
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
make a claim because and I won't get
 
02:21:22.490 --> 02:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
well well into it here but when you're
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
talking about neutral risk and other
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
factors relative to determination on a
 
02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
workers comp claim the fact that the
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
person's working at home might make it
 
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
more difficult to assert a claim but
 
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not that they're barred
 
02:21:36.170 --> 02:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
from doing that additionally what we've
 
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
seen and this might seem a little in the
 
02:21:40.370 --> 02:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
weeds but if you look at RSA 275 there's
 
02:21:42.889 --> 02:21:42.899 align:start position:0%
requirement for reporting pay so
 
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
essentially that pay that says that okay
 
02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
an individual who reports to work
 
02:21:50.210 --> 02:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
at their employer's request is entitled
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
to two hours of pay at least for that
 
02:21:54.240 --> 02:21:55.730 align:start position:0%
to two hours of pay at least for that
day

02:21:55.730 --> 02:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
um that has come up as an issue is what
 
02:22:00.110 --> 02:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
happens with reporting pay when the
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
person does not
 
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
report anywhere and instead they're
 
02:22:06.530 --> 02:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
working at home I will say that if the
 
02:22:08.570 --> 02:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
department if the legislature were to
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
provide Clarity on that it would be
 
02:22:11.690 --> 02:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
welcome from the Department the
 
02:22:13.389 --> 02:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
Department's present position
 
02:22:15.889 --> 02:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
and people can disagree with this but
 
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
the Department's present interpretation
 
02:22:19.849 --> 02:22:19.859 align:start position:0%
application has been that there's not a
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
two-hour requirement for reporting pay
 
02:22:25.010 --> 02:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
the reason being is reporting reporting
 
02:22:28.250 --> 02:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
to work was looked at as an ambiguous
 
02:22:29.690 --> 02:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
enough term that we looked to
 
02:22:31.550 --> 02:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
legislative history and when we look to
 
02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
legislative history around reporting pay
 
02:22:36.650 --> 02:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
it was replete with reference to
 
02:22:39.290 --> 02:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
employees commuting employee spending
 
02:22:41.870 --> 02:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
gas and how if you had someone driving
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
someplace and it takes them an hour or
 
02:22:47.450 --> 02:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:49.790 --> 02:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
um you should at least pay them for two
 
02:22:51.650 --> 02:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
hours because of the commuting and again
 
02:22:53.150 --> 02:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
I I understand people might be
 
02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied with that application but
 
02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
that's presently where we've been on
 
02:22:57.240 --> 02:22:58.309 align:start position:0%
that's presently where we've been on
that

02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
um so if there's Clarity around what was
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
meant by reporting pay and whether
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
reporting pay should apply to instances
 
02:23:06.170 --> 02:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
in which folks are uh working from home
 
02:23:08.210 --> 02:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
that would be welcome by the department
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
and I've also point out that if someone
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
disagrees with our interpretation of
 
02:23:14.809 --> 02:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
reporting pay and appealed that up maybe
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
we would see
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
um you know some type of clarity but
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
again presently that's the Department's
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
position those are just two examples but
 
02:23:23.870 --> 02:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that have mostly come
 
02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
up I think you're right though that
 
02:23:29.090 --> 02:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
um reporting uh working from home has
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
brought up certain instant questions
 
02:23:33.290 --> 02:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
around time worked not as frequently as
 
02:23:34.910 --> 02:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
the reporting pay issue or the workers
 
02:23:36.469 --> 02:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
comp issue but some people have asked us
 
02:23:38.270 --> 02:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
well you know what do I have to pay and
 
02:23:39.889 --> 02:23:39.899 align:start position:0%
we to be clear if someone's working from
 
02:23:42.410 --> 02:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
home they're still working and if
 
02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
they're an hourly employee you still
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
have to pay them for All Hours worked
 
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:55.969 --> 02:23:55.979 align:start position:0%
Mr Ogden uh the uh boilers for the new
 
02:23:58.730 --> 02:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
folks here boilers can be any vessel
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
Under Pressure compressor you know a lot
 
02:24:03.710 --> 02:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
of businesses so it used to be my
 
02:24:06.770 --> 02:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
recollection last 15 20 years is that if
 
02:24:10.010 --> 02:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
you had a vessel under pressure
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
you folks wanted an inspection done and
 
02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers would come out there
 
02:24:17.690 --> 02:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
and they go out and do that and now I I
 
02:24:19.849 --> 02:24:19.859 align:start position:0%
hear I pleasantly so you folks now
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
provide that service for fifty dollars
 
02:24:24.650 --> 02:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
is that the so we yes we do that does
 
02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
happen I'll still say the vast majority
 
02:24:28.969 --> 02:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
of inspections are still handled by
 
02:24:31.250 --> 02:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
insurance company inspectors that they
 
02:24:33.110 --> 02:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
handle the vast volume of them but we do
 
02:24:35.389 --> 02:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
have boiler inspectors who do do boiler
 
02:24:35.399 --> 02:24:40.010 align:start position:0%
have boiler inspectors who do do boiler
inspections

02:24:40.010 --> 02:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:43.010 align:start position:0%
 
good

02:24:43.010 --> 02:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:49.730 --> 02:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
I would advise well what you know the
 
02:24:51.770 --> 02:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
questions you know I have no problem
 
02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
with the com uh
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
communication and the conversation going
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
back and forth
 
02:25:00.410 --> 02:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
um some of the things that we've
 
02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
discussed today are not even on our
 
02:25:03.290 --> 02:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
agenda for bills this year but that's
 
02:25:05.809 --> 02:25:05.819 align:start position:0%
okay it's good to have that discussion
 
02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
um I will tell you that some of these uh
 
02:25:12.469 --> 02:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
rsas that were mentioned 281a I keep
 
02:25:14.210 --> 02:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
right with me all the time workers
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
compensation 275 these are our our uh
 
02:25:19.790 --> 02:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
I'm a Christian so don't get mad at me
 
02:25:21.050 --> 02:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
this is our Bible
 
02:25:23.870 --> 02:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh this is the things that we look
 
02:25:25.849 --> 02:25:25.859 align:start position:0%
at all the time and one of the things I
 
02:25:27.770 --> 02:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
would suggest to many of the members is
 
02:25:30.770 --> 02:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
when you come in front of these the
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
hearings we have and it states right on
 
02:25:36.410 --> 02:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
you know this has to do with RSA you
 
02:25:39.770 --> 02:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
know whatever the RSA 275 and that's
 
02:25:41.570 --> 02:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
where this the language is that wants to
 
02:25:43.250 --> 02:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
be amended it's a good idea to just take
 
02:25:45.410 --> 02:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
a look at that where that is
 
02:25:47.330 --> 02:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
because sometimes it'll be one word or
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
one sentence and you don't have the
 
02:25:50.929 --> 02:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
paragraph before of the other parts of
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
the law and it makes it just easier to
 
02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:54.889 align:start position:0%
the law and it makes it just easier to
understand

02:25:54.889 --> 02:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
um when you're when you're trying to
 
02:25:58.190 --> 02:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
figure out what this bill is and it's
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
totally foreign to you
 
02:26:02.330 --> 02:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
um you know what's before and after and
 
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
also we have a researcher here
 
02:26:07.610 --> 02:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
um you can ask questions regarding and
 
02:26:08.990 --> 02:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
I've already asked one question on one
 
02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the bills how long is the current law
 
02:26:13.250 --> 02:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
been in place and and what was the
 
02:26:14.809 --> 02:26:14.819 align:start position:0%
thought process of the law back then
 
02:26:16.370 --> 02:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
because it's always important to know
 
02:26:18.590 --> 02:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
what happened 20 years ago why was this
 
02:26:20.809 --> 02:26:20.819 align:start position:0%
law put into place
 
02:26:23.090 --> 02:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
um so just some some references
 
02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the Department
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
of Labor
 
02:26:28.610 --> 02:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
I do but I'm going to ask them
 
02:26:31.130 --> 02:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
all right where's Jeff Cahill
 
02:26:33.290 --> 02:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I just wanted to
 
02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh see what the schedule would be for uh
 
02:26:38.030 --> 02:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
training sessions that you offer to
 
02:26:40.610 --> 02:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
employers I found those very useful to
 
02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
attend when we typically do those in the
 
02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
spring when we have the Slate set up
 
02:26:49.130 --> 02:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
this year we will send that out if
 
02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
people are interested attending I know
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
um last year they did more remote
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
um because some of the places that we
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
used to go to for various reasons have
 
02:27:00.889 --> 02:27:00.899 align:start position:0%
kind of gone away from the big in-person
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
meetings but once we have us uh again I
 
02:27:05.210 --> 02:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
would look for it in the spring and when
 
02:27:06.770 --> 02:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
we have the calendar we will send that
 
02:27:06.780 --> 02:27:09.950 align:start position:0%
we have the calendar we will send that
out

02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much gentlemen
 
02:27:13.309 --> 02:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
just a couple more things for the
 
02:27:13.319 --> 02:27:14.630 align:start position:0%
just a couple more things for the
committee

02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:15.410 align:start position:0%
committee
um

02:27:15.410 --> 02:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:17.630 --> 02:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
these folders have your name on them and
 
02:27:19.910 --> 02:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
every time you come here for
 
02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:20.510 align:start position:0%
every time you come here for
um

02:27:20.510 --> 02:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:24.290 --> 02:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh or here in your folders will be
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
papers pertinent to what you're going to
 
02:27:29.690 --> 02:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
be discussing please leave this behind
 
02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
so Heather can have it
 
02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
um and then she'll you know put some
 
02:27:35.330 --> 02:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
more things in again I don't know what's
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
going to happen after January 31st she
 
02:27:39.170 --> 02:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
told me to get all our bills done by
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
January 31st so we don't have to worry
 
02:27:42.290 --> 02:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
about it
 
02:27:42.300 --> 02:27:43.490 align:start position:0%
about it
um

02:27:43.490 --> 02:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:44.809 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:27:44.809 --> 02:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:46.969 --> 02:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to reiterate the 19th the
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
26th we may have to meet on a Tuesday I
 
02:27:53.150 --> 02:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
know that's not
 
02:27:55.070 --> 02:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
um what we'd like to do we always like
 
02:27:57.469 --> 02:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
to meet on Thursdays I can't do any of
 
02:28:00.110 --> 02:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have nine uh fiscal
 
02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:01.490 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have nine uh fiscal
note

02:28:01.490 --> 02:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
um bills that have to go out on the by
 
02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
the 16th of February
 
02:28:07.969 --> 02:28:07.979 align:start position:0%
um and what I don't want to have to
 
02:28:10.370 --> 02:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
happen is we're executing them all in
 
02:28:11.570 --> 02:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
the 16th
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
because Brian can tell you that doesn't
 
02:28:15.710 --> 02:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
work out well
 
02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
um so I will try to give as much
 
02:28:19.610 --> 02:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
advanced notice I am working with the
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
clerk and the speaker to find out in
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
advance when they're going to have
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
hearings excuse me how sessions so we
 
02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
can continue to meet meet our schedule
 
02:28:29.150 --> 02:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
and meet on Thursdays representative
 
02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:31.309 align:start position:0%
and meet on Thursdays representative
Sullivan

02:28:31.309 --> 02:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
Sullivan
 
02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that not all
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal note bills are a second committee
 
02:28:38.750 --> 02:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill so some of those might not be
 
02:28:40.490 --> 02:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
second committee
 
02:28:43.130 --> 02:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
um so you might get cut a Break
 
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
um I will check into that thank you
 
02:28:46.190 --> 02:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
um the other thing
 
02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
um Democrats we're going to have a
 
02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:48.830 align:start position:0%
um Democrats we're going to have a

02:28:50.270 --> 02:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
