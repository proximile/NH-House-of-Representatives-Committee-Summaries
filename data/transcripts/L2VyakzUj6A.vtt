this bill number 487 represents many
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
hours of dedicated time and energy from

local food economies Thrive many of
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
those who contributed to this bill will
 
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 align:start position:0%

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 align:start position:0%
snow has thrown off some of our plans
 
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
but there are plenty of people here who
 
00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 align:start position:0%
will be able to answer the questions
 
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
that you have I'm sure
 
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
um any of you heard me introduce the
 
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
bill last year but I want to talk a
 
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
little bit um
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
to those who are new or maybe weren't
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
part of the school nutrition
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that met um in the year
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
between last term and this term
 
00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
we were able to um myself and other
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in this bill were able to
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
talk to the Department of Education and
 
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture and have
 
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
come up with a a somewhat different bill
 
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
the farm to school program operates in
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
some schools across the state at this
 
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
moment so local food is nourishing our
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
children supporting local farmers and
 
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
strengthening the resiliency of our
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
supply chain in some communities across
 
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
the state the investment we're asking
 
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
the state legislature to make and the
 
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
state to make will make it possible for
 
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
schools and communities all over the
 
00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:01.259 align:start position:0%
state to take advantage of the benefit
 
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
of local food for local schools
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
with this policy we can improve the
 
00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:07.979 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of our children
 
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
improve the local economies and the
 
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:13.259 align:start position:0%
resiliency of our local food system
 
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
the department of education's office of
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs and services would
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
provide a monetary incentive to schools
 
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
who choose to direct more of their per
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
meal cash reimbursement funds from the
 
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
USDA towards purchases from New
 
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.909 align:start position:0%
USDA towards purchases from New
Hampshire

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
this day would then encourage this
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
channeling of federal funds into the
 
00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:35.459 align:start position:0%
local economy by awarding schools a
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
dollar for every three dollars spent on
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
food from our state the goal is for
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
local schools to be purchasing at least
 
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
10 percent of their food from local
 
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
farms all that money then gets returned
 
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
to our local economy where it continued
 
00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:52.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I shared with this subcommittee last
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
year and we'll share again that um or
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
with the school nutrition subcommittee
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
last year and want to share again that
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
um there's another financial piece of
 
00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
this which is the return on investment
 
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
that we get from investing in school
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs I know you're hearing
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
lots of school nutrition bills so you
 
00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:13.019 align:start position:0%
may already know this but a study out of
 
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
the Rockefeller Institute has shown us
 
00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
that for every dollar we invest in
 
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
school nutrition there's a two dollar
 
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
return on investment so this is a
 
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible commitment from our
 
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
state should we choose to make it
 
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.389 align:start position:0%
state should we choose to make it
foreign

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
by offering every school a reimbursement
 
00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
of up to twelve hundred dollars we would
 
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
be investing in our children's health
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
and our local economies we can also
 
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
redirect 1.2 million federal dollars
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
into our local economy that will help us
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
build food system into infrastructure
 
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
that will make us resilient for the
 
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.269 align:start position:0%
that will make us resilient for the
future

future
 
00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
our children's health and the health of
 
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
our farms and farming communities are
 
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
worth this investment
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
as a result of conversation and
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
important feedback that we received over
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
the past year about this local Farm to
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
Local Schools food reimbursement policy
 
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
we are only allowing for reimbursements
 
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
of local food grown in New Hampshire
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
we're also excluding liquid milk which
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
we realized would eat up the
 
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
reimbursements quickly for an item that
 
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
is most times already coming from our
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
region if not our state
 
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
liquid milk also gets mixed together
 
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
across from with milk from New Hampshire
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
and other states across the region so
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's much harder to tell whether it
 
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Education we are
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
asking for one staff person to
 
00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:35.339 align:start position:0%
administer the program the total cost of
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
the hire is estimated to be a hundred
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
and forty five thousand dollars and then
 
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
the technology to write the code to get
 
00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:43.019 align:start position:0%
the program up and running will be a
 
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
one-time investment of fifty thousand
 
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.710 align:start position:0%
one-time investment of fifty thousand
dollars

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
and we're asking the legislature to
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
commit six hundred thousand dollars to
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
the reimbursements themselves which will
 
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
go to the school nutrition programs
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
you'll notice on the um so
 
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
you'll notice on the bottom of your bail
 
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.790 align:start position:0%
you'll notice on the bottom of your bail
that

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
the six hundred thousand dollars is not
 
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
so I uh have an amendment which adds the
 
00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:11.579 align:start position:0%
actual six hundred thousand dollars for
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement funds
 
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.569 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement funds
um

00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:14.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
into it's just a mistake in the original
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
bill that I didn't catch in time
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
um over Christmas so I'm going to pass
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
that around to you
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
um excuse me so when you have that
 
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
Amendment would you please hand all
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%

introduced by somebody on the committee
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%

in closing although I do have a letter
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
that I have to introduce as well but um
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
a robust Farm to school program will
 
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
help strengthen New Hampshire's
 
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
agricultural sector and Regional food
 
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
security it'll also help New Hampshire
 
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
students understand the regional
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
agricultural Geographic social and
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
cultural aspects of our food system here
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%

further

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
um no so that's all I have at this
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
moment I'm open to take your questions
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
at this moment thank you questions from
 
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:22.700 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh represent the dry
 
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman and thank you
 
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh
 
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
um are you ready yeah I'm just getting
 
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
somebody so I can take notes yeah
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
um 1200 applies to if it applies to
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
every school it's kind of a big
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
difference between twelve hundred
 
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
dollars to the Cornish Elementary and
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred dollars to cure Sarge
 
00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
High School is not prorated it's just a
 
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
flat fee yes that's correct
 
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
um and you're right it makes a
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
difference depending on the school it's
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
up to twelve hundred dollars
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so if each school would
 
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
get a third of what they spend so small
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
elementary schools may not spend thirty
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
six hundred dollars if they're not able
 
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
to but they would be reimbursed up to a
 
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
third of that
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and so in the past what we are one of
 
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
our challenges is
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
um a number of Staff people to deal with
 
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
a complicated system and so that was one
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
way that we thought would be
 
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:26.459 align:start position:0%
um easier for
 
00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:29.459 align:start position:0%
um Administration yeah thank you that's
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%

00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
um I just have a question about what
 
00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
vegetables and fruits you think the
 
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
students will be acquiring from New
 
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from say the end of September
 
00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
through the beginning of May
 
00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:55.019 align:start position:0%
that is such a great question and I get
 
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
very excited about it having been a part
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
of the farm to school movement in my

town for over a decade
 
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot to say about that but I
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
actually think that you want to hear
 
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
from the director of the farm to school
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
program who will have much more detailed
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
information about that and we'll share
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
with you a calendar of um mostly
 
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.660 align:start position:0%

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
of us as children and as adults being
 
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
with pride when we go to an
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
establishment featuring our Maple syrups
 
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
our berries our meats and produce and
 
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
various other value-added products
 
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
the same should be true for our children
 
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
in our schools
 
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
after speaking with myriads of families
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
in both communities whose Lifestyles
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
vary but their commitment to seeing
 
00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
Foods grown and produced locally is here
 
00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
I'm unified today with that desire our
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
districts children and nutrition
 
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
directors in both Milford and the
 
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
Amherst are featured in that storybook
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
that representative Simpson
 
00:16:59.449 --> 00:16:59.459 align:start position:0%
brought before you
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
and um are excited to see that there
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
would be more locally procured
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
nutritionally dense foods at the tables
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
in the classrooms as a former educator
 
00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:09.770 align:start position:0%
in the classrooms as a former educator
myself

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
the natural value in this effort extends
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
to learning and mentorship of a greater
 
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
understanding of our food system our
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
geography and also gives way to an
 
00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:21.419 align:start position:0%
organic conversation about the
 
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
importance of knowing where our food
 
00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:24.299 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
and by whom it is grown and that the
 
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
food supply resiliency is something that
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
we all must invest in together
 
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
I have the honor and frankly a bit of a
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
sorrow in talking with folks who have
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
for decades sought and worked hard to
 
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
reintroduce and implement the farm to
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
school program in our communities within
 
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
the San Diego Valley
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
but the time is right for our uh
 
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
students and our health and our local
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
economies to expand this program for the
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
farmers who work tirelessly to bring
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
foods not only
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
to our restaurants and grocery stores
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
but to our students whose nutrition will
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
no doubt benefit from the expansion of
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
there being local Farm to school
 
00:18:06.409 --> 00:18:06.419 align:start position:0%
reimbursement monies available in our
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
school lunch programs across New
 
00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:09.230 align:start position:0%
school lunch programs across New
Hampshire

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
I urge the colleague my colleagues in
 
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
House Education to support this program
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the commitment to finding uh and
 
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.270 align:start position:0%
and the commitment to finding uh and
mentoring

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
mentoring
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me funding and mentoring the
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
benefits of locally sourced nutrient
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
dense foods so that our children's
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
schools farmers and communities have the
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
best shot we can in thriving thank you
 
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
as a parent to three kids under 12 as a
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
former teacher and as Amherst and
 
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
milford's uh state representative for
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 37. thanks so much
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
uh representative Peter now
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
um how many farmers do you have who are
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
interested in this program
 
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so we have heard
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
regionally in uh the Amherst Milford
 
00:18:58.669 --> 00:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
area we have Farms all across whether
 
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
it's lull Farm Trombley Farm Brook uh
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
Brookdale Fruit Farm we have several in
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
the area who would love to participate
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
in this program and the school food and
 
00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
nutrition Pro uh child directors have
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
have expressed that desire to continue
 
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
to look and Source Foods where they can
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
they do to the best of their ability try
 
00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:21.539 align:start position:0%
to still get some of those Foods locally
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
sourced but it has become something that
 
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
they would like to see expanded
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
Rosa Tanner thank you and thank you for
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question what benefit do you
 
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
see or benefits do you see to the local
 
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
farmers from uh starting up this program
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely I I think there are many I
 
00:19:44.529 --> 00:19:44.539 align:start position:0%
serve in environment and Agriculture and
 
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
aside from the additional exposure that
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
they get to having their food in the
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
schools it is also
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
um when we talk about locally sourced
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
economic resiliency I think that that's
 
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
part of the equation here right
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
um many times in classrooms where I had
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
been in
 
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
um the understanding of where their food
 
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
came from at lunch the children where
 
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
their food came from wasn't always
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
widely known and I think that this is
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
also part of that conversation as
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson mentioned to
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
connect children to their local food
 
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.890 align:start position:0%
connect children to their local food
sources

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
sources
 
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.049 align:start position:0%
sources
foreign

00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:26.450 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
um

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
in my experience
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
as a farmer for many years one of the
 
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
things that I've noticed is that
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
people don't really grasp where their
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
food is coming from unless they've
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
actually grown it touched it walked in
 
00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:42.419 align:start position:0%
the field
 
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
built a relationship with the animals
 
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
they're raising how exactly would the
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
students be developing a greater
 
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
understanding of where their food comes
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
from if it's arriving to them just like
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
all their other food does
 
00:20:57.169 --> 00:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I think some of
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
our folks at the farm to school program
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
will talk about like the food of the
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
month club that is also integrated with
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
that but in addition I think there's
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
also a natural opportunity for teachers
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
though it does not mandate any sort of
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
instructional curriculum I think it
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
gives a great opportunity for that to be
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
woven into the curriculum whether it's
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
geography whether it's talking about
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
those farms and where they are in their
 
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
communities and those types of food I
 
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
think that natural connection is there
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:30.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
um well first I'd like to say that I I
 
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:34.100 align:start position:0%
love the idea of incentivizing local
 
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
farms I think that's great but I do have
 
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
one significant concern that I hope you
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
can speak to a little bit here in this
 
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
um what is the reason
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
um in this bill that we would
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
um limit it to only schools
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
participating in the national school
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
lunch program and only to the guidelines
 
00:21:57.409 --> 00:21:57.419 align:start position:0%
put forth by the USDA which which rely
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
heavily on the now widely discredited
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
so if I if I some of the folks behind me
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
will speak to some of that but some of
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
it is a requirement regarding uh the
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
funding and the sources of which that
 
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
that income comes from but I will
 
00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:15.299 align:start position:0%
certainly let folks behind me speak to
 
00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
that in Greater detail I do understand
 
00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
it's complicated but I appreciate the
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock did you have a
 
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.289 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock did you have a
question

00:22:23.289 --> 00:22:23.299 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you uh with the chairman good
 
00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
morning representative how you doing
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
good to see you
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
um last year when the tortillas are
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
going to bill was introduced initially
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
uh secretary Jasper was here and he
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
spoke with favor of the bill you know he
 
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
still supports this bill
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
I believe that um the concept is
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
something that he is really interested
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
in seeing he has he had come before my
 
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
committee and actually spoke about
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
similar um efforts that um their work is
 
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
is interested in continuing to pursue so
 
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
uh though I don't want to speak for the
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner because I am not the
 
00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.710 align:start position:0%
commissioner because I am not the
commissioner

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
um it has been something that he had
 
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
spoken in favor of before thank you
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh further questions
 
00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative for testifying and I'll
 
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
I'll make copies and submit my uh
 
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
testimony for the record thank you
 
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:26.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record I'm
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative hope Damon Sullivan
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
District 8 the towns of Acworth Langdon
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
lemster gosh in Washington Springfield
 
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
San P coyton and Claremont I think I
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
said all nine
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
I'm stepping back from my role on this
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
committee and into my career as a
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
dietitian and diabetes educator and I
 
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
vigorously support this bill
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
local food tastes better
 
00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
in blind taste tests if you give people
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
a fresh local carrot at an ordinary
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
grocery store carrot
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
they will tell you that the fresh local
 
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
one is sweeter and more yummy
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
my anecdotal experience of that I'm also
 
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
a significant vegetable Gardener not at
 
00:24:15.169 --> 00:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
all commercially just sort of sharing
 
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
through the neighborhood
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
and one of our neighbors twin daughters
 
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
when she was seven pulled a carrot from
 
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
our garden
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
brushed it off not afraid of dirt took a
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
bite and looked at her mom and said her
 
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
carrots taste way better than your
 
00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:32.210 align:start position:0%
carrots taste way better than your
carrots

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
carrots
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's not unique and children will eat
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
healthy good food if it tastes good to
 
00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.630 align:start position:0%
healthy good food if it tastes good to
them

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
so I vigorously support the idea of
 
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.529 align:start position:0%
so I vigorously support the idea of
local

00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:42.539 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
I think it is critical that we support
 
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
our farmers and this is an excellent way
 
00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
I think it was representative pedernal
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
who asked how many farmers are involved
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
or engaged in this possibility
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
since reading this bill a couple days
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
ago I reached out to three farmers in
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County they all
 
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
were very very interested they were not
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
aware of the possibility and would
 
00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:12.539 align:start position:0%
indeed have fresh posts available in
 
00:25:15.409 --> 00:25:15.419 align:start position:0%
some cases into November and then again
 
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
starting in May there's a lot of growing
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's happening in tunnels
 
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
those arched plastic looking things that
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
you see in the landscape where we're
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
extending the growing season a lot in
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the productivity is
 
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.070 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the productivity is
good

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
um or apples
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
Apple's store really well we have lots
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
of apple farms in New Hampshire
 
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
and we are serving kids apples that come
 
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
from Washington State routinely I don't
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
think that makes any sense
 
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
honestly I want to just speak to the
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
statement about the basis of the food
 
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.490 align:start position:0%
statement about the basis of the food
pyramid

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
pyramid
 
00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:54.539 align:start position:0%
I've been a dietitian for 40 something
 
00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
years no matter what structure is
 
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
outlined to Define good nutrition
 
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
they all say more fruits more vegetables
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
lean proteins this fits perfectly with
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your time
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you questions
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you again
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
um just to pick your brain a bit as a
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
dietitian because I obviously don't know
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
as much about that topic
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
um during our introduction to the USDA
 
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
that we went through a couple of weeks
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
ago and the requirements if I recall
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
the USDA requires that all of all
 
00:26:33.529 --> 00:26:33.539 align:start position:0%
calories half of them must come from
 
00:26:36.409 --> 00:26:36.419 align:start position:0%
carbohydrates and it also prohibits milk
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
with a fat content of more than one
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
percent in schools that are
 
00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:42.299 align:start position:0%
participating if you can you speak to
 
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
the to the quality of that and if we
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
really want to be subjecting ourselves
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
to Federal requirements that feed our
 
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
sorry happy to try to answer
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
two parts really that are kind of
 
00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:00.110 align:start position:0%
two parts really that are kind of
different

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:03.539 align:start position:0%
so uh working in reverse the question of
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
non-fat or lower fat dairy products
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
there's an enormous controversy in the
 
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
field of nutrition on that topic
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
and you can find credible research and
 
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
perspective on both sides
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
I personally think the weight of the
 
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
evidence still continues to support
 
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
less fat dairy products because the fat
 
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:27.020 align:start position:0%
that cinderic products is saturated fat
 
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
which there is Decades of evidence
 
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
but food preferences that people develop
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
when they're children
 
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
to a considerable degree last well into
 
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
adulthood unless somebody makes a
 
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
concerted effort to change
 
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
so if children learn to enjoy what we
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
believe is healthier for them that will
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
probably serve them well for the rest of
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
their lives
 
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
I would have a note that this bill
 
00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
exempts fluid milk so that consideration
 
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't really fit here
 
00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:06.059 align:start position:0%
and then refresh my memory what was your
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
first part
 
00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
um oh the carbohydrate sorry spring
 
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
cramp for a second
 
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
just a quick layer basis because I
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
learned in my career very often that
 
00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
people perceive carbohydrate containing
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
food so much more narrowly than is
 
00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:21.529 align:start position:0%
food so much more narrowly than is
accurate

00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:21.539 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
everything that comes from the ground
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
everything that was originally a plant
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
is a carbohydrate with the exception of
 
00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
vegetable oils pressed from corn or
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
sunflower seeds or whatever so in other
 
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
words if the food item didn't come from
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
an animal a chicken or a fish it has
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
carbohydrate fruits and veggies are
 
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
carbs oatmeal is a carb
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
legumes we are growing beans in New
 
00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:48.539 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now dry beans like before
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
black bean soup for hummus things like
 
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.010 align:start position:0%
black bean soup for hummus things like
that

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
so I think when we look at the
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
recommendation of how much the diet
 
00:28:59.810 --> 00:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
should come from carb the quality of the
 
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
carb the sources of the carb mix is much
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
difference as the amount that is
 
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
recommended I certainly wouldn't be
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
recommending that anybody get 50 of
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
their energy intake their calories from
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
white bread
 
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
or any bread for that matter but
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
carb is the energy fuel source that
 
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
muscles and the brain and other organs
 
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
use most efficiently most effectively I
 
00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:24.299 align:start position:0%
hope that's helpful
 
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the questions
 
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
00:29:41.649 --> 00:29:41.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:45.140 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Solutions
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
speak on skin deeper
 
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:54.430 align:start position:0%
speak on skin deeper
um

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.049 --> 00:29:59.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
what we see is that you know our what we
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
advocate for is feeding children who
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
don't normally have access to healthy
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
affordable food and what we see with the
 
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
farm to school bill is that on average
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's a nine percent increase in
 
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
participation in school meals when
 
00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
um Farm to school is implemented that 90
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
that nine percent means that children
 
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
who might not normally eat breakfast or
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
lunch in school are now eating breakfast
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
or lunch at school getting a balanced
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
diet and getting those calories that
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
they need that they might not be
 
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
receiving at home
 
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
um it also is great for the economy as
 
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
you've heard I don't think I need to
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
cover that again but there is a great
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
return on investment for local farmers
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
and for the school district
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
those food service programs run as a
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
business and they are better able to
 
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
feed more kids when they have more
 
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
participation so again going back to
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
that nine percent increase it means that
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
more there's more dollars for Food
 
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.570 align:start position:0%
more there's more dollars for Food
Service

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
Service
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
um programs to pay more money to their
 
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
staff to maybe purchase more local food
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
using other dollars because of the
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
increase in participation and
 
00:31:08.039 --> 00:31:08.690 align:start position:0%
increase in participation and
um

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
and also you know being able to give
 
00:31:12.649 --> 00:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
back to their community and have that
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
return on investment back into the
 
00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:16.430 align:start position:0%
return on investment back into the
community

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%

00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:06.299 align:start position:0%
beside the point
 
00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:08.870 align:start position:0%

um

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%

begged
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
could jehold tried anything to get the
 
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
NASA administrators not to Launch
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
the data supported the fact that if the
 
00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:52.460 align:start position:0%
temperatures dropped below 50 degrees
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
there was a danger that the O-rings
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
and the shuttle would this would be
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
would be destroyed
 
00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:06.419 align:start position:0%
data today also speaks to the reason why
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
we as a society need to not only support
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
current farmers
 
00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
but also the farmers of the future our
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
children right
 
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
I'm also on the education and Outreach
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
committee for Nova New Hampshire and my
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues onofa will be speaking to why
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
farmers will benefit
 
00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:30.059 align:start position:0%
but I want to speak to the data that
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
supports why we should be doing this and
 
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
I gave a document to representative Ford
 
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
to pass around and if you would just
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
turn in your document to this page right
 
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
here this second side of the first sheet
 
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
looks like this on the front side
 
00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
if you could just proceed I don't know
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
if everyone has a copy of that yet so oh
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
just I have I have one extra does
 
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.470 align:start position:0%
just I have I have one extra does
everyone

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
yeah does everybody have a copy
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
just I have one extra yeah it's okay go
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
ahead oh okay so if you look on the back
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
side of that first sheet
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
the national oceanographic and
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
Atmospheric Administration keeps track
 
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
every year of how many billion dollar
 
00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.450 align:start position:0%
every year of how many billion dollar
disasters

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
disasters
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
have occurred
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
it would be difficult for anybody in
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
this room to not recognize that that we
 
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
have different kinds of meteorological
 
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
events happening in our society we have
 
00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
floods we have wind storms and and the
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
number is increasing every year
 
00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
if you look where I've highlighted in
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
red the top table on that sheet
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
represents the 20 years from 1980 to
 
00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:44.030 align:start position:0%
represents the 20 years from 1980 to
1999.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
1999.
 
00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
and in those 20 years there were 82
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
billion dollar disasters 20 years 82
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
billion dollar disasters and the cost to
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
society was around 480 billion dollars
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
for those disasters if you look at the
 
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
second table down highlighted in red at
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
that represents the year's
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
2017-2022 five years not 20.
 
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
86 billion dollar disasters to the tune
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
of roughly 750 billion dollars
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
those numbers are going to continue to
 
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.750 align:start position:0%
those numbers are going to continue to
increase

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
we are in a perilous situation here in
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because we produce
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
probably around three to four percent of
 
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
our food and State
 
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
some of you probably remember during the
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
the early days of the pandemic that
 
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
there were empty shelves
 
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
we need to do anything and everything
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
that we can to support local farming
 
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
Nova New Hampshire many of us and other
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
people in the state believe that by 2030
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
the state should be producing 30 percent
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
of its food in state
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
thirty percent three to four percent now
 
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
thirty percent by Twenty Thirty our
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
surrounding states like Vermont Maine
 
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts even produce roughly
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
10 to 12 percent of their food currently
 
00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.099 align:start position:0%
so the data speaks to the fact that we
 
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
need to truly do anything and everything
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
that we can to support farming and
 
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
gardening restorative sustainable
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
farming and gardening the state over the
 
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
next couple of decades to not only
 
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
ensure the survival of our children but
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
also of the other life forms that make
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire such a a mecca for
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
vacation and tourism
 
00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:35.579 align:start position:0%
so that's what I would like to speak to
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
the last page here and I I would I would
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
welcome any and all of you

the last the last two lines you can look
 
00:36:58.730 --> 00:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
on it's kind of hard to see in fact I
 
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
have to put my spectacles on to be able
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
to read it
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
she tried to protect our spaceship earth
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
she taught her children
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony um I
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
certainly agree with the concept of
 
00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:29.339 align:start position:0%
trying to increase uh the amount of food
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
that we produce here in New Hampshire
 
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
um but I'm wondering about your
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
testimony based on the idea of utilizing
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
um what's it called now sustainable and
 
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
restorative practices does that mean
 
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
um without or with minimal use of of
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
fertilizers and such
 
00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:48.500 align:start position:0%
yes it does
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up please thank you just
 
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
um do you have a concept of how much of
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire land might have to become
 
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
Farmland to produce 30 of the food that
 
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
we consume utilizing sustainable methods
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
that I do not know however
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
if you have a lawn in front of your
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
house or anywhere around your house or
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
you have community garden space
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
available to you you as an individual or
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
as a family can be growing on that space
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
restoratively and sustainably building
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
up carbon in the soil over time which
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
will help combat the buildup of carbon
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
dioxide in our atmosphere just as a
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
point of information 1986 when that
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
precious woman was lost was the first
 
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:41.579 align:start position:0%
year that the atmospheric carbon levels
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
exceeded those levels which had been
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
or access to early childhood education
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
and access to proper nutrition
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
we have high school clubs we call them
 
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
scan clubs I have four in the state of
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and they join the club not
 
00:39:50.569 --> 00:39:50.579 align:start position:0%
because they want to advocate for better
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
access to early childhood education they
 
00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
join the scan clubs because they want to
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
talk about nutrition and they want to
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
talk about their own nutrition and the
 
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
nutrition of their classmates
 
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
so I have some testimony here from the
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
president of the Concord High School
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
scan Club
 
00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:11.579 align:start position:0%
you may have seen the company monitor
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
did an article about her front page a
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago she did a major fundraiser
 
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
and food drive for the local schools to
 
00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:23.579 align:start position:0%
put better Foods in their pantries she's
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
really passionate about this she was
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
going to speak before you but her final
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
that was yesterday got moved to today at
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock so ideally wouldn't it be
 
00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:35.099 align:start position:0%
great if you guys could actually meet in
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
schools and talk to the students my
 
00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
favorite expression is nothing about us
 
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
without us how can we make decisions
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
about look at shaking her head how can
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
we make these decisions about students
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
without hearing from them so I'm going
 
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
to urge you to talk to the students
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
because in my work with these students
 
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
basically is they're asking can you get
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
rid of the junk that's in our cafeteria
 
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:02.339 align:start position:0%
we don't want pizza burgers and french
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
fries anymore I was with Alex at school
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
one day and someone walked by with a
 
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
tray of food and the oranges were in a
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
plastic container where you rip the
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
cover off
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
and she said heaven forbid they give us
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
a real orange
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
so they have a voice and they want to be
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
heard and they want you to know that
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
they want better quality food and they
 
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:25.619 align:start position:0%
want to support their Farmers my scan
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
Club in Pembroke is full of of students
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
that are very passionate about this
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
issue I met with them and they want to
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
go to elementary schools and they want
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
to educate young students about what
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's actually like to peel a banana
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
because we know some students don't even
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
know how to do that they don't know that
 
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
fruit and vegetables come from the
 
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
ground they think they come from cans or
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
plastic containers so I just want you to
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
know that students are passionate about
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
this they want you to care about their
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
food choices and unfortunately they
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
can't be here right now to tell you that
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
because they have finals and other
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
things and they're applying for colleges
 
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
so I want to be the voice for those
 
00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
students and I ask you to please talk to
 
00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:14.339 align:start position:0%
them please let them tell you what they
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
need and what they want we at scan and
 
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
adamantly support this bill so I would
 
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:22.320 align:start position:0%

meet the needs of schools
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
incentive programs like these that many
 
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:41.099 align:start position:0%
other states have already implemented
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
including Maine New York and Vermont
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%

food funds to support local agriculture
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%

00:47:20.809 --> 00:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
how would this interact with you is
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
there duplication or it just sounds like
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of what this hopes to do is
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
already be done yeah so New Hampshire
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
Farm to school will help schools
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
implement this reimbursement program we
 
00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
can and we already have some resources
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
developed that will help students
 
00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
understand where their food comes from
 
00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
like the New Hampshire Harvest of the
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
month program which has classroom and
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
cafeteria resources as well as things
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
that kids can take home
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
and so we do have the resources within
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
my department as and with many other
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
partners across the state that would
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
help the Department of Education make it
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
a successful program
 
00:48:02.569 --> 00:48:02.579 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
oh representative woodcock
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
hey chairman Cardiology
 
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming uh just to help me
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
out could you go back and uh clarify for
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
me your uh mention of the federal court
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
relief funding and the time frame on
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
that please sure so uh we had to apply
 
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
for it
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
um last summer so this Cooperative
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
agreement the federal government made
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
funds available to every state that's
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
based on you know student population
 
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
um and so we had to submit an
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
application of how we were going to
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
expend those funds and so the plan was
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
approved by the federal government and
 
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's going through our New Hampshire
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture and I I want
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
to say it needs to get executive Council
 
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.309 align:start position:0%
to say it needs to get executive Council
approval

00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
um so I'm hoping to hear some more
 
00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
information about that this month
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
because it's a short timeline to have to
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
spend this money by next fall so
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
um it's it's there but I think it needs
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
to go through some other stuff before we
 
00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
actually have access to it
 
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you very
 
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
much for being here thank you
 
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for allowing me to speak
 
00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.990 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for allowing me to speak
today

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
my name is Jane Jonas and together with
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
my wife Marilyn we own and operate
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
Hungry Bear Farm in Wilton and Mason New
 
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to we have been growing high
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
quality produce two or above organic
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
standards for our community going on 14
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
years now
 
00:49:59.089 --> 00:49:59.099 align:start position:0%
we used to vent at many area farmers
 
00:49:59.099 --> 00:50:00.290 align:start position:0%
we used to vent at many area farmers
markets

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
markets
 
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
but for the past seven or eight years
 
00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
we've mostly sold through our spring and
 
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
Main season csas about 30 weeks per year
 
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
we have a little experience selling to
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
schools but if given the opportunity
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
would probably choose to do so
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
I can tell you without a doubt that our
 
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
produce has been enjoyed by many people
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
over these years and surprisingly
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
especially by children and kids
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
one of the greatest Joys I encountered
 
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
during our CSA months is to witness the
 
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
excitement small children exhibit when
 
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
they come to pick up their CSA shares
 
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
every Tuesday at our farm seeing how

welcome good morning
 
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
um my name is David Trumbull I live in
 
00:58:18.109 --> 00:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
the town of where I'm a vegetable farmer
 
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
I've been a farmer for over 40 years
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
I've run my own farm for the last 37
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
years certified organic I'm also the
 
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
manager of a multi-farm CSA there's six
 
00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
Organic Farms that provide food to about
 
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
250 families we grow about three acres
 
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
of produce and provide seedlings to
 
00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
about 400 families on our farm over the
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
years we've sold the stores throughout
 
00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
the state csas in down to the Boston
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
Market when our children were younger we
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
got involved in the schools and
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
developed relationships there doing
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
farmer to the school programs in the
 
00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:53.339 align:start position:0%
elementary school building raised beds
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
and growing food at the middle school
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
that went to the food pantry and
 
00:58:59.809 --> 00:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
appearing at days when they invite
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
people from the community to come in and
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
talk about different careers there's
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
been really good testimony talking about
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
the value of the quality of local food
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
for the students so I won't go into that
 
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
and also the value to the state economy
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
of the almost 2 million dollars a year
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
but I would just like to emphasize as a
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
farmer two points first is why would
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
farmers want to participate in this
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
program and the reason is this is that
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
farmers have to make a living and
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
they're looking for markets that will
 
00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:26.339 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of their production we
 
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
have not sold produce to our local
 
00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:30.059 align:start position:0%
school because it would not work work
 
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
out economically the price that they
 
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
could pay just would not match our cost
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
of production as local small-scale
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
farmers they can buy food off the truck
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
where they buy all the rest of their
 
00:59:41.809 --> 00:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
food at a cheaper rate with this bill
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
was going to be an economic incentive
 
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
that gives the school some extra money
 
00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
so that they can then deal with the
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
local farmers meaning that the schools
 
00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
will get the produce and the farmers
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
will be able to get paid their a price
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
that will match their cost of production
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
so if you pass this bill using this
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
funds you will help the farmers go find
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
that extra market right now they may
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
have a few Acres of vegetables and have
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
various farmers markets and other
 
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
outlets one more Market can really make
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
a big difference to that farm in terms
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
of that Farm's viability you know this
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
would give them that opportunity to
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
participate the second thing is the
 
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
building relationships in the community
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
once you get a farm involved in bringing
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
in produce to the school they're going
 
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
to now start showing up at the school
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
they'll be making deliveries and they'll
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
start building relationships and when
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
the school says well we want to have a
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
program involving something to do with
 
01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:29.579 align:start position:0%
agriculture they'll say we already have
 
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
a farmer we're working with so they'll
 
01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
call that farmer in say will you come in
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
and work with our kindergarten class
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
bring in pots fill them up with plant
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
seeds do something farmer to school
 
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
program will you help us make a garden
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
up behind our school you'll build these
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
relationships so this bill is not just
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
about buying food it's about building
 
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
relationships and I I would as a farmer
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
I would offer it my support for those
 
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
reasons thank you thank you very much
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.870 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
I do have one question for you I'm not
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
yes I have to hook that fast uh and
 
01:01:02.569 --> 01:01:02.579 align:start position:0%
maybe you can help me
 
01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
um and maybe this question was asked
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
during the time that I wasn't here when
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
I was out at another meeting but uh
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
question regarding where I live in
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
Haverhill that's right in the
 
01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:14.579 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River much of the land which
 
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
we have in haverhills least by farms in
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
Vermont due to statutory regulations
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont finds it very good to be able to
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
do that so we have material our our
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
crops which are perhaps grown but
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
process across the river and we see that
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
as one community
 
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I know the same thing when I go
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
shopping at Hannaford it says local on
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
it and the potatoes from Arista County
 
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
so in order to make this work do we have
 
01:01:49.609 --> 01:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
to really better Define the word local
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
there are legal definitions of what
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
local means I think for New Hampshire it
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
means it has to be produced in the state
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
some people in marketing terms will say
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
anything grown within 50 miles like
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
it'll be Farm stands to say we resource
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
from farms within a 50-mile radius and
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing and you're in the
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
position there on the Connecticut River
 
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
Valley we have some of the best Farmland
 
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
in the entire country
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
so but maybe you maybe this bill could
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
be amended to make a situation like
 
01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:19.140 align:start position:0%
yours where you're right on the border
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
if there are Vermont Farms producing a
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
lot of carrots that they could sell to
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
your school if there's no other carrot
 
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
grower in town but it could also maybe
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
encourage some local farmers in your
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
area to say wow okay there's a potential
 
01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
Market there let's see if we can't get
 
01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
into this
 
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome sir

you very much are there questions from
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:57.170 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
regarding we we keep hearing about
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
vegetables and its roots and whatever
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering do you know how much
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
we are accessing fish and animals meat
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
currently our schools with the farmers
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
that we have in the state
 
01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
um I specifically do not know that
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
information but I imagine our friends at
 
01:07:24.529 --> 01:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
maybe the Northeast organic farming
 
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
Association or the uh Monadnock Farm to
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
School Association I believe is another
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
one who could probably tell you a lot
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
more as well as the UNH
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
um sustainability Institute I believe
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a lot of places to
 
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:45.500 align:start position:0%
get that information
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's good that this bill
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
includes you know both Investments and
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
vegetables but also Dairy and you know
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
fruit uh meat and beef and poultry and
 
01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:00.299 align:start position:0%
fish you know those are all important
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
um nutritional needs so
 
01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.410 align:start position:0%
um nutritional needs so
um

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm not entirely sure how
 
01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:11.339 align:start position:0%
much we're accessing now
 
01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:14.339 align:start position:0%
um but I imagine that it would greatly
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
be boasted by this legislation thank you
 
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
very much for the questions represent
 
01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.450 align:start position:0%
very much for the questions represent
Belcher

01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
um there's a word I'm not clear on I
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
I've heard a number of times now
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
um the word justice is being used in
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
context I'm not familiar with such as I
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
think I heard food Justice can you can
 
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
you Lucid Define what that means in this
 
01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:35.870 align:start position:0%
you Lucid Define what that means in this
context

01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
I'm sure so
 
01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
um I think in this context it refers to
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
um Social Justice and
 
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
um quite frankly economic Justice in a
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
number of ways
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
um you know the way we fund schools here
 
01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as we are all very
 
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
familiar with on this committee
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
um you know you know schools and towns
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
are left to do with what they can with
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
property taxes that they have and
 
01:09:10.209 --> 01:09:10.219 align:start position:0%
low-income communities
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
do not get as much funding as wealthier
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
communities and so this bill would
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
address some of those issues by pretty
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
much leveling the playing field by
 
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
allowing schools and low-income
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
communities to use these monies the same
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
way that these schools and Wealthy
 
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
communities are able to use this money
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
further questions not seeing any hands
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
this will conclude our hearing on 487 we
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
have no more pink cards so this hearing
 
01:09:51.289 --> 01:09:51.299 align:start position:0%
is closed
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:33.260 align:start position:0%
I'll see if we can probably
 
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
put some right here he's pretty shallow
 
01:10:47.229 --> 01:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:06.020 align:start position:0%

I I am introducing a bill that will
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
require the Department of Education to
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
provide us with education law books
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
um that are annotated and in uh last
 
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
term the first part of the last term
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
well I back up a little bit this is my
 
01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
fourth term on the education committee
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
fifth term in the house and each of
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
those terms up until last term we were

supplied the education annotated laws
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
the first year of last term was very
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
chaotic with covid and whether we were
 
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
masked or whether we were here or not
 
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
here or whatever when we finally came
 
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
into and during that period of time we
 
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
did not receive this book and it it
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
greatly bothered me and so the second
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
year of the term I put in a bill
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
um to require the Department of
 
01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:37.640 align:start position:0%
Education to provide us with this book
 
01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
and why
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
um well I'm a trained my education is
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
all in in education I'm a retired
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
teacher and not a lawyer and it was very
 
01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
intimidating when I first got on the
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
education committee although I really
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to be on the committee uh
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
intimidating with all the the lawyer
 
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
talk and trying to devise laws and and
 
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
knowing what was going on I I was very
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
frustrated when I first came to the
 
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
state house because after many years of
 
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
teaching and any of you that have been
 
01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
in schools know that sometimes the rules
 
01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
that are made at the state level
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
just don't fit with the schools when
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
they're put into into action so I was
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
very keen on you know changing some of
 
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
the laws and
 
01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
um I found the book to be invaluable to
 
01:13:34.729 --> 01:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
bring me up to speed it's annotated it
 
01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
has the history of bills it has the
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
changes in bills over the years as well
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
as what the present Bill States
 
01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
and so not having it during that first
 
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
part I I kind of said wow you know I
 
01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
really really need to ensure for me for
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
all of us here that we have that sort of
 
01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
resource we you know we have a box over
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
in the state house we have our little
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
file cabinet and we have a great
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
research assistant but she's dealing
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
with a lot of people and can't be
 
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
bothered on a regular basis with our
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
little questions about rules so it's
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's one of our resources I I think it's
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
necessary for us to do our job properly
 
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.669 align:start position:0%
necessary for us to do our job properly
and

01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
um I know that rules are the laws are
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
online I've gone on Google several times
 
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
to find them but you don't find the
 
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
annotations and it isn't like you can
 
01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
have an interest in for example School
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
nutrition and look it up in the mid
 
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
various laws that it appears in the law
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
books so
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
I feel the book is really important so
 
01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
what happened to my bill well it went
 
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
out of this committee unanimously
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
because I think everyone particularly
 
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
incumbents knew how valuable sometimes
 
01:14:56.689 --> 01:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
you don't realize what you don't have
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
so uh but it went out of committee
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
unanimously went into the Senate and
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
presenting it and of course Senator have
 
01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
their their offices and they have their
 
01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
researchers and you know they they're
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
set up in a different
 
01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:11.630 align:start position:0%
set up in a different
um

01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
framework than we are as far as
 
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
resources are concerned and so I was
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
explaining trying to explain to them the
 
01:15:20.209 --> 01:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
same thing I'm explaining to you why I
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
think they're necessary and um
 
01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
the person from OLS uh came to to
 
01:15:28.729 --> 01:15:28.739 align:start position:0%
testify against my bill and basically
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
his uh testimony said that the publisher
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
was not going to publish the that he had
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
heard that the publisher was not going
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
to publish the book again and that
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
um not only that but you know it's
 
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
online and everybody can see that and
 
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
you know ask OLS they have their
 
01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
resource people and we'd be just fine
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
without it so the Senate
 
01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
um despite my
 
01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:55.070 align:start position:0%
um despite my
urgings

01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
urgings
 
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
um tabled it and so it didn't go through
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
so I was kind of um
 
01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:03.260 align:start position:0%
ready this year to put in the same bill
 
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
uh thinking that well maybe you know
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
we'd get the the book I spent some time
 
01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
researching with the publisher uh
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
Thompson Reuters and also Westfall and
 
01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
to try to find out where exactly it was
 
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
being published where it was being
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
printed because the first part of the
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
book has governor sununu in it I I knew
 
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
that that probably wasn't something that
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
was put in uh at a national printer and
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
I came up that ends every place I went I
 
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
came up dead ends so come into
 
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
um session this year into our committee
 
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
and happened to cruise to the back of
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
the room to speak to our attorney from
 
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education who does a
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
wonderful job for us uh really and um
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
there she is with a green book a brand
 
01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:00.659 align:start position:0%
new uh annotated
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
education law so as you probably
 
01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
understand from some of the in-house
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
jokes that we've had about asking when
 
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
we're going to get our book
 
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
um it was published this year and it was
 
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
printed this year
 
01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:14.510 align:start position:0%
printed this year
um

01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
and it isn't available to us and I think
 
01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:20.900 align:start position:0%
that's a real shame
 
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
you'll note that on the bill it has a
 
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
financial note with it I spoke to my
 
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
local superintendent because one of the
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
things that I think is important and
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
should happen if it didn't was that all
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
the superintendents in the state should
 
01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:38.570 align:start position:0%
the superintendents in the state should
get

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
the annotated education laws I mean how
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
are you going to follow laws unless you
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
really know what's happening and he
 
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
assured me that the state department
 
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
made available to them a flash drive or
 
01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:54.659 align:start position:0%
however you want to call it um to with
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
all the um annotated bills on it I I'm
 
01:17:59.810 --> 01:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
not sure it was annotated actually but
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
he said that the state department
 
01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
provided him with that and told him that
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
if he wanted another one for his
 
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
principles or whatever that it would
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
cost him a hundred dollars a piece
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
which seems kind of steep for a flash
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
drive but
 
01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming that's the cost for the
 
01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
book as well it's about a hundred
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
dollars a book and yet the fiscal note
 
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
um which you may be able to ask other
 
01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:27.659 align:start position:0%
people that have developed that physical
 
01:18:27.659 --> 01:18:28.910 align:start position:0%
people that have developed that physical
note

01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
note
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
um estimates fifty four thousand dollars
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I figure if there's 20 of us and 100
 
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
a book and maybe throw in a few extras
 
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
um you know it's probably less than five
 
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I kind of questioned the the amount
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
of money although maybe it's shipping
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
costs or whatever
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
so anyway
 
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
um that's my story I've given you
 
01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
um it was three hole punch so my margins
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
are kind of wide and you'll have to play
 
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
like teacher and try to figure out in
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
the context what the word is
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
um I always love those and I'm open for
 
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much
 
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner uh before we go
 
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
into questions I just want to impart
 
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
some information here
 
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with the ranking
 
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative here and myself we both
 
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
agree this bill needs to move forward
 
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
and this is echoing what this committee
 
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
did in previous years unanimously
 
01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
and if we want to move forward and if we
 
01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
want to exec that bill immediately we
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
have to do that today
 
01:19:39.169 --> 01:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
and by doing so we can get it and we
 
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
don't have to get it into the calendar
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
because the public is hearing us that we
 
01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
may be executing this bill today
 
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
and with that we can get it in the
 
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
calendar for action on the next session
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
which would be next week
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
and so I would encourage all committee
 
01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:55.739 align:start position:0%
members here to afford US the time to
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
have a quick executive session so we can
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
move this thing forward
 
01:20:03.169 --> 01:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
so are there any questions
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative Wright thank you Mr
 
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative Tanner
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear the online version
 
01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
right now does not have the is not
 
01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:14.810 align:start position:0%
right now does not have the is not
annotated

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
annotated
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh right and when you go when you go
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
online at least and I'm not a computer
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
expert so maybe I'm totally missing
 
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
something but when you go online
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
uh you can't put in like I said
 
01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
nutrition like I've spent hours kind of
 
01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
going to Chapters uh on a particular
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
subject that I was interested in and
 
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
finding references from one particular
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
law to another law and be able to look
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
up that
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
um whereas when I've gone online you
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
know I have to put in like 194 colon 5
 
01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.470 align:start position:0%
know I have to put in like 194 colon 5
subsection

01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
subsection
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
and then that's what I see so
 
01:20:54.239 --> 01:20:54.850 align:start position:0%
and then that's what I see so
um

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:54.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
and plus when I need it sometimes is
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
when we're talking we're having bills
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
coming in and you'll see references
 
01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
within the bill
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh for different
 
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
laws and all of a sudden I want to say
 
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
oh well what was that or even
 
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
representative Bruno will grab my book
 
01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
and say let me look that up
 
01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:20.219 align:start position:0%
um and it's right there versus going on
 
01:21:23.169 --> 01:21:23.179 align:start position:0%
the computer hoping that the legislative
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
internet's up and running fast and
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
getting to that and then then coming
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
down so a book in hand and maybe it's
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
old school but a book in hand is what I
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
like I'm going to make another comment
 
01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.750 align:start position:0%
like I'm going to make another comment
here

01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
this is not old school this is current
 
01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
school when we talked in previous years
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
about the delivery of an adequate
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
education and we were wanting to find
 
01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
out what happened in Londonderry case
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
the Claremont decisions it's not there
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
online you will not find that that
 
01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
enters into our discussion and our
 
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
decision making and we need these Yellow
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
Green books light green yes we need the
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
Green books
 
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.260 align:start position:0%

I'll break a rule would you believe
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
I've been uh I've been also caught
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
um snooping through uh chairman Ladd's
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
law book as well okay yeah and all the
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
sticky notes and everything so yes well
 
01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:22.580 align:start position:0%
looking for things
 
01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
we borrowed it yes together represent
 
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.010 align:start position:0%
we borrowed it yes together represent
Woodcock

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
um representative because you know I
 
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
don't lost anyhow when it comes to this
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
trying to get it on I can't get it on my
 
01:22:34.729 --> 01:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
flip phone by the way in case you're
 
01:22:34.739 --> 01:22:35.870 align:start position:0%
flip phone by the way in case you're
interested

01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
interested
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
um uh the question is is this law going
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
to be uh annual uh every biennium to be
 
01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
or just singly for this uh issue this
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
session I believe it's written that they
 
01:22:53.169 --> 01:22:53.179 align:start position:0%
are required in French biennium
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
to present us with that well thank you
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I want to clarify
 
01:22:59.330 --> 01:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
one more thing if we don't exec this
 
01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
bill in the next eight minutes we will
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
not be executing this bill
 
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:06.910 align:start position:0%
not be executing this bill
foreign

01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:23:11.689 --> 01:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
you for bringing this forward my
 
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned the fiscal note
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
on the back it says that the bill would
 
01:23:19.209 --> 01:23:19.219 align:start position:0%
be for the cost of 54 000 would be for
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
424 members of the House and Senate yet
 
01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
the title of the bill says it would just
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
be for those on education committees so
 
01:23:28.729 --> 01:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
could you clarify which is which
 
01:23:28.739 --> 01:23:29.590 align:start position:0%
could you clarify which is which
um

01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.330 align:start position:0%
um
well

01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:31.340 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
I didn't didn't realize that uh they
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
thought everybody in the state house
 
01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
should have a book
 
01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
um it the bill isn't the intent of the
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill my intent of the bill is just for
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
the education committee for the House
 
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
and Senate education committee and I
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
thought that was in the bill but if it
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
isn't yeah it's just the fiscal note at
 
01:23:53.930 --> 01:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
the bottom says otherwise but all right
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you yep further questions
 
01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.169 align:start position:0%
thank you yep further questions
yes

01:23:57.169 --> 01:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm concerned about the fiscal note
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
also because that seems like
 
01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:02.870 align:start position:0%
also because that seems like
um

01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
I guess I try to put this in a question
 
01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
maybe this would be more appropriate for
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
the exact if I had something to say
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
statement wise about getting this
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
changed because
 
01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
it'll go to finance this is a early bill
 
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
with a financial note we're looking at
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
the policy matters here in terms of the
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
physical note that will be the uh
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
responsibility of division two Finance
 
01:24:30.169 --> 01:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
when they receive this bill
 
01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
so you you know that this question of
 
01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
course will be brought up at that time
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
further questions representative thank
 
01:24:45.649 --> 01:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you Linda for
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
bringing our representative Tanner for
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward I know from your
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
mentoring how valuable this book would
 
01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
be if I had it
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
um and I think that the fiscal note took
 
01:24:58.850 --> 01:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
the last line of the bill that a member
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the House Representatives or Senate
 
01:25:02.649 --> 01:25:02.659 align:start position:0%
May request and they
 
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
budgeted as if the entire House and
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
Senate are going to request it which
 
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
seems extremely improbable so it's
 
01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
clearly a very generous fiscal note
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
yes and I I would really like this bill
 
01:25:17.209 --> 01:25:17.219 align:start position:0%
exec today because even if it goes
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
through today it means we'll get a book
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
starting the next time any more pink
 
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
hearts for this bill okay I'm closing
 
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
this hearing
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay we will go into executive session
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%

steeper decline
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%

01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%

01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
since 2019 at least 26 states have
 
01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
passed laws to improve literacy and
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
Implement what researchers have found
 
01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
about how kids learn to read
 
01:36:02.930 --> 01:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
as Frederick Douglass said once you
 
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
this legislation is based upon the
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
successful state literacy legislation
 
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
around the country and consult a
 
01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
consultation with local and National
 
01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:20.750 align:start position:0%

experts

01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.030 align:start position:0%
experts
um

01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
it also follows on to initiatives uh
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
initiated by commissioner edelblood and
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
the department which will you will see
 
01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:33.179 align:start position:0%
in the exhibits
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is go through the
 
01:36:39.649 --> 01:36:39.659 align:start position:0%
legislation and point out the high
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
points to you I think the top sheets you
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
have in your packet that's volume one by
 
01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:48.980 align:start position:0%
the way I'm just kidding
 
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
the top sheets are a highlighted version
 
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
of the legislation which I'll be
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
um section one
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
discusses the need for screening
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
assessment and intervention
 
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
you will see on uh lines at the top a
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
line seven on down and the requirement
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
for a universal screener for reading to
 
01:37:22.330 --> 01:37:22.340 align:start position:0%
be used in all public schools in grades
 
01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh any substantial deficiency
 
01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.550 align:start position:0%
uh any substantial deficiency
found

01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
found
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
as a result of these screenings
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
would be the generation of an individual
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
a learning plan and intervention in
 
01:37:47.110 --> 01:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
general education classes
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'll just note that I do have an
 
01:37:52.570 --> 01:37:52.580 align:start position:0%
amendment that will be brought forward
 
01:37:58.010 --> 01:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
which integrates further the uh three HP
 
01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:02.219 align:start position:0%
337 dyslexia bill into this and you'll
 
01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
note also that I've been contacted by
 
01:38:05.699 --> 01:38:06.729 align:start position:0%

01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
the Dibble screening test and I have a
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
call with her this afternoon she wants
 
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.139 align:start position:0%
to discuss how they can support this
 
01:38:19.139 --> 01:38:22.850 align:start position:0%
to discuss how they can support this
legislation

01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.370 --> 01:38:27.380 align:start position:0%
um so in lines 13 through 19 you'll see
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
about the development of an individual
 
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
reading plan uh where there is
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
intervention required and below that uh
 
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
I list the requirements of the
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
individual reading plan including goals
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
and benchmarks the services to be
 
01:38:48.129 --> 01:38:48.139 align:start position:0%
provided the reading instruction
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
and I do mention at the bottom of the
 
01:38:55.209 --> 01:38:55.219 align:start position:0%
page 30 lines 30 31
 
01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
that the three queuing method of reading
 
01:39:03.290 --> 01:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
instruction shall not be used and we'll
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
talk about three queuing a little bit
 
01:39:07.199 --> 01:39:10.810 align:start position:0%
talk about three queuing a little bit
later

01:39:10.810 --> 01:39:10.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh going on I think the second major
 
01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:17.810 align:start position:0%
uh going on I think the second major
Point

01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
Point
 
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
um is that we want school parental and
 
01:39:24.649 --> 01:39:24.659 align:start position:0%
Community involvement in this process if
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to improve literacy
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
um in the state of New Hampshire I think
 
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh all hands have to be on deck not just
 
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
the teachers in the classroom
 
01:39:36.890 --> 01:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
you'll see that when there's a
 
01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
deficiency discovered immediate parental
 
01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
notification is required and that
 
01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
notification would include the
 
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
requirement for uh the presentation of
 
01:39:56.209 --> 01:39:56.219 align:start position:0%
strategies that parents can be used be
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
using to help their child improve in
 
01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:08.169 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:08.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
major point
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
is annual reporting and that is on the
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
bottom toward the bottom of page two
 
01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
um reporting would be required from each
 
01:40:24.410 --> 01:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
district annually first to the
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
department and then to the legislature
 
01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
and below that on the bottom of page two
 
01:40:32.570 --> 01:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
and over on looks at me I guess it's
 
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
just on the bottom of page two you will
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
see the requirements for that reporting
 
01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:42.179 align:start position:0%
so that we all can have an idea of how
 
01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
literacy Improvement is working in the
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
state and to make sure it is working in
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh if there is no meaningful progress
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
then there would be a referral made for
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
special education I do not require any
 
01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
specific time for a special education
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
referral when we're talking about HB 337
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
there was some indication about
 
01:41:15.649 --> 01:41:15.659 align:start position:0%
time frames and what
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
time frames are used in schools but I
 
01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
did not specify anything in here because
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to
 
01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:28.390 align:start position:0%
I don't want to
over

01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
categorize students into special net
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.609 --> 01:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
um the fifth Point
 
01:41:43.010 --> 01:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
um is uh on the middle of Page Three
 
01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
um and this is a a departure from what
 
01:41:49.010 --> 01:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
we have now uh there would be reading
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
Improvement Grants
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
um this is really paired with uh
 
01:41:55.689 --> 01:41:55.699 align:start position:0%
highlight number seven you'll see later
 
01:41:59.930 --> 01:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
but the reading Improvement Grants would
 
01:42:03.010 --> 01:42:03.020 align:start position:0%
replace the third grade reading
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid that we have now
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
these new grants would provide up to one
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for each student with
 
01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.290 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for each student with
deficiency

01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
deficiency
 
01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
and as you know
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
um that's uh more than the current
 
01:42:23.689 --> 01:42:23.699 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid plus differentiated
 
01:42:27.649 --> 01:42:27.659 align:start position:0%
Aid is only provided when the student is
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
not free and reduced lunch special ed or
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
English language learner so I think this
 
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
will be quite a few more students that
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for the one thousand
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
dollar reading Improvement Grants
 
01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.689 align:start position:0%
dollar reading Improvement Grants
foreign

01:42:46.689 --> 01:42:46.699 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:50.219 align:start position:0%
just down further on the page is uh
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
number six
 
01:42:55.149 --> 01:42:55.159 align:start position:0%
which modifies the current literacy
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
statutes 189 of 53.
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
and what I've inserted here is the fact
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
that we need to provide instruction
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
based on measurable evidence-based
 
01:43:14.810 --> 01:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
reading practices down below you'll see
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
I specifically mention what is termed
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
the science of reading
 
01:43:24.530 --> 01:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
um the science of reading is based on
 
01:43:29.090 --> 01:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
years of research into how students
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
learn to read and on the top of the next
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
page you'll see the main components
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
of the science of reading uh going on
 
01:43:46.129 --> 01:43:46.139 align:start position:0%
from phonics to vocabulary and oral
 
01:43:50.090 --> 01:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
language and we'll talk about science of
 
01:43:53.169 --> 01:43:53.179 align:start position:0%
reading a little bit more and there is a
 
01:43:57.770 --> 01:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
a document in your handout related in
 
01:44:01.209 --> 01:44:01.219 align:start position:0%
depth to the science of reading
 
01:44:03.970 --> 01:44:03.980 align:start position:0%
and the last
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
major bullet point is number seven the
 
01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
repeal of the differentiated Aid statute
 
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
which is printed on your sheet for your
 
01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:18.770 align:start position:0%
which is printed on your sheet for your
information

01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:21.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
if I could go briefly through the
 
01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.609 align:start position:0%
if I could go briefly through the
exhibits

01:44:25.609 --> 01:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
exhibits
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
um just to point out to you what what is
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
um beach one is um
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
numbered um exhibit one Etc
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
exhibit one is
 
01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
the result of a five-year investigation
 
01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
by an education reporter into reading
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
instruction it's called sold a story and
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
is a series of eight I think it's eight
 
01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:56.300 align:start position:0%
podcasts or
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
you can read the transcripts but it's
 
01:45:02.410 --> 01:45:02.420 align:start position:0%
very informative
 
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
and it really details the failures of
 
01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.109 align:start position:0%
and it really details the failures of
current

01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:45:11.209 --> 01:45:11.219 align:start position:0%
reading instruction in many places based
 
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
on that three queuing technique that I
 
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier and the move to the
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
science of reading
 
01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.270 align:start position:0%
science of reading
um

01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
in particular I uh I recommend episodes
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
one five and six of of the podcasts
 
01:45:29.639 --> 01:45:30.950 align:start position:0%
one five and six of of the podcasts
um

01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
going further quickly
 
01:45:33.119 --> 01:45:33.830 align:start position:0%
going further quickly
um

01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
flip side of that page exhibit two are
 
01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
the um reading scores uh from nape uh
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
specifically for New Hampshire
 
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
number three is a uh disturbing
 
01:45:53.410 --> 01:45:53.420 align:start position:0%
assessment of Nate results with uh
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
charts on reading scores around the
 
01:45:56.639 --> 01:45:57.649 align:start position:0%
charts on reading scores around the
country

01:45:57.649 --> 01:45:57.659 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh fourth is the uh
 
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
a paper called
 
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
excuse me academic recovery and risks
 
01:46:11.689 --> 01:46:11.699 align:start position:0%
remain and that's from uh the Amplified
 
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
parent company of Dibbles did I
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
01:46:18.430 --> 01:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
the fifth exhibit is New Hampshire
 
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
English language arts proficiency rates
 
01:46:24.410 --> 01:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
by school
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
for 2017 to 2021
 
01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh number six is the
 
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh explanation of the science of reading
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
um but again this is uh the science of
 
01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:45.659 align:start position:0%
reading is uh now widely accepted across
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
the country and there's a great movement
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
toward this type of instruction
 
01:46:53.530 --> 01:46:53.540 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
01:46:59.330 --> 01:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
numerous states that have implemented
 
01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
um I think it's 26 States since 2019
 
01:47:06.189 --> 01:47:06.199 align:start position:0%
have implemented literacy legislation
 
01:47:08.810 --> 01:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
mostly based on the movement to the
 
01:47:10.910 --> 01:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
science of reading
 
01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:11.990 align:start position:0%
science of reading
um

01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
and um I I think that we should follow
 
01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:16.729 align:start position:0%
and um I I think that we should follow
suit

01:47:16.729 --> 01:47:16.739 align:start position:0%
suit
 
01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
um in that
 
01:47:22.370 --> 01:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
document uh exhibit number seven talks
 
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
about the three queuing system
 
01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:29.629 align:start position:0%
about the three queuing system
um

01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
and as mentioned um in the testimony on
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 377
 
01:47:41.090 --> 01:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
um this method was popularized by a
 
01:47:42.490 --> 01:47:42.500 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
textbook and lectures
 
01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:46.910 align:start position:0%
textbook and lectures
um

01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
dating back several decades
 
01:47:54.169 --> 01:47:54.179 align:start position:0%
um and the three queuing method involves
 
01:47:57.890 --> 01:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
really just what it says cues readers
 
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
are looking at cues and those cues could
 
01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:02.090 align:start position:0%
are looking at cues and those cues could
be

01:48:02.090 --> 01:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
um looking at a picture in the text
 
01:48:08.649 --> 01:48:08.659 align:start position:0%
um trying a word to see what makes sense
 
01:48:11.450 --> 01:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
and even skipping a word to try and
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
figure out what that sentence says so a
 
01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
lot of it is encouraging guessing on the
 
01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
part of a reader one example that's
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
stuck in my mind from the podcast sold
 
01:48:31.570 --> 01:48:31.580 align:start position:0%
the story was a middle school teacher
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
relaying how one of her students thought
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
that the text said that in 1939 Poland
 
01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:42.659 align:start position:0%
they invited the Germans into their
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
country rather than invaded their
 
01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:46.790 align:start position:0%
country rather than invaded their
country

01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
which um is considerable difference
 
01:48:53.810 --> 01:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh exhibit 8 is the Scarborough's
 
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
reading rope which was created a couple
 
01:48:59.689 --> 01:48:59.699 align:start position:0%
of years just to show the complexity of
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
reading and many of the strands you'll
 
01:49:04.490 --> 01:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
see relate back to the science of
 
01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:06.410 align:start position:0%
see relate back to the science of
reading

01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
reading
 
01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
number nine is a discussion of reading
 
01:49:13.930 --> 01:49:13.940 align:start position:0%
legislation around the country
 
01:49:17.090 --> 01:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
and number 10 follows on to that and
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
highlights uh the examine of examination
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
of what has been done in four states
 
01:49:28.850 --> 01:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
um and um for anyone interested I also
 
01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:30.109 align:start position:0%
um and um for anyone interested I also
have

01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:49:31.810 --> 01:49:31.820 align:start position:0%
um a chart
 
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
showing all 50 states and what has been
 
01:49:37.609 --> 01:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
going on in in all 50 states that I'd be
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
um number 11 and 12 I had mentioned that
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
this follows on to initiatives from the
 
01:49:53.090 --> 01:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Education number 11 is a
 
01:49:57.350 --> 01:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
press release from last year about
 
01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
um their coal their so-called leaning
 
01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
into literacy program which talks about
 
01:50:06.590 --> 01:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
training parents and Educators in the
 
01:50:08.209 --> 01:50:08.219 align:start position:0%
science of reading
 
01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:12.179 align:start position:0%
and number 12 is the program that has
 
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:14.780 align:start position:0%
been implemented the letters
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
courses that are available and the uh
 
01:50:22.129 --> 01:50:22.139 align:start position:0%
goal is to train something like uh 9 000
 
01:50:25.370 --> 01:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
people teachers and parents across the
 
01:50:28.129 --> 01:50:28.139 align:start position:0%
state in the next few years in the
 
01:50:30.050 --> 01:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
science of reading
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the final document is an article
 
01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
written by a former Governor Jeb Bush of
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
Florida about
 
01:50:45.050 --> 01:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
um the instruction into reading
 
01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:45.890 align:start position:0%
um the instruction into reading
um

01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:48.290 --> 01:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
I think we need to reverse the decline
 
01:50:51.649 --> 01:50:51.659 align:start position:0%
in the reading abilities of our students
 
01:50:51.659 --> 01:50:53.570 align:start position:0%
in the reading abilities of our students
um

01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
there are many components to this bill
 
01:50:59.450 --> 01:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
the screening assessment intervention
 
01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
involvement on the part of everybody and
 
01:51:07.570 --> 01:51:07.580 align:start position:0%
the new reading Improvement Grants
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
so I ask your support in this bill and I
 
01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
think that having a high school diploma
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire should mean that you
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
can read and write and just let me close
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
with a quote from a teacher at the end
 
01:51:26.890 --> 01:51:26.900 align:start position:0%
of the sold the stories
 
01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:29.350 align:start position:0%
of the sold the stories
podcasts

01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
podcasts
 
01:51:33.410 --> 01:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
where she discovered that her daughter
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
this was a teacher she discovered that
 
01:51:39.410 --> 01:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
her daughter was having problems and
 
01:51:41.090 --> 01:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
everyone thought that her daughter was
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
reading reading well in school that's
 
01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.179 align:start position:0%
what she was told told
 
01:51:48.169 --> 01:51:48.179 align:start position:0%
but her daughter came to her and said I
 
01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
can't read
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
the teacher went on to say
 
01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
this kid's sinking everywhere and
 
01:51:57.290 --> 01:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
they're looking for our help
 
01:51:59.810 --> 01:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
and it's on us
 
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
well right now it's on us and we have
 
01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to impact the future of
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
many children in this state and really
 
01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
the future of this state
 
01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for your
 
01:52:13.609 --> 01:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
attention thank you very much
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
01:52:17.689 --> 01:52:17.699 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask one question that I
 
01:52:19.010 --> 01:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
have to be out of here in a few minutes
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
to present and finance representative
 
01:52:25.070 --> 01:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
cordelli on your bill on page one line
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
13 says each student who exhibits a
 
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
substantial deficiency in Reading
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
on page two line seven it says the
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
parent of any K through three student
 
01:52:39.530 --> 01:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
who exhibits a deficiency in Reading
 
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
my question therefore is that you're
 
01:52:45.649 --> 01:52:45.659 align:start position:0%
going to communicate with a parent
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
that there's a deficiency and of course
 
01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
in my experience as a fourth grade
 
01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:52.070 align:start position:0%
in my experience as a fourth grade
teacher

01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
01:52:54.410 --> 01:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
and as an administrator and a principal
 
01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
an education all my life in the
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
elementary end that there are students
 
01:53:03.490 --> 01:53:03.500 align:start position:0%
in grade three and earlier who have
 
01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:06.659 align:start position:0%
these elements are components of reading
 
01:53:07.970 --> 01:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
that you've mentioned whether it be
 
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
phonics or phonetic awareness whether it
 
01:53:13.490 --> 01:53:13.500 align:start position:0%
be fluency vocabulary or comprehension
 
01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
these third graders though have
 
01:53:18.290 --> 01:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
vocabulary and comprehension but I gave
 
01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
them against mcginnity test they would
 
01:53:22.609 --> 01:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
show on a norm reference test high
 
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
achievement in the country yet they may
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
not have
 
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
that fanatic background that we speak of
 
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
or awareness so what a Digraph is what a
 
01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
diphthong is so my my con question to
 
01:53:39.649 --> 01:53:39.659 align:start position:0%
you I guess is that should we have the
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
notification to apparent on page two
 
01:53:45.729 --> 01:53:45.739 align:start position:0%
where it says a substantial deficiency
 
01:53:49.010 --> 01:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
which is going to allow for the student
 
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
that's really reading well and
 
01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
comprehending everything they read and
 
01:53:55.970 --> 01:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
has a tremendous vocabulary but may not
 
01:53:59.410 --> 01:53:59.420 align:start position:0%
be just in the expert in area phonics
 
01:54:01.729 --> 01:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
so should we have similar language
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
between page one and page two
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
um I I think that might might be
 
01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:08.689 align:start position:0%
um I I think that might might be
appropriate

01:54:08.689 --> 01:54:08.699 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
um but I think that if we move all of
 
01:54:13.970 --> 01:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
the state into the science of reading
 
01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:15.649 align:start position:0%
the state into the science of reading
instruction

01:54:15.649 --> 01:54:15.659 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:54:18.649 --> 01:54:18.659 align:start position:0%
um that will help with the the phonics
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
component that you that you mentioned
 
01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:21.350 align:start position:0%
component that you that you mentioned
also

01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
um it's not going to happen overnight I
 
01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
realize that
 
01:54:28.129 --> 01:54:28.139 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
really leads into the question
 
01:54:33.470 --> 01:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
um that we can talk about also
 
01:54:35.689 --> 01:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
um is to this science of reading
 
01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
research has been going on for a decade
 
01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
or more why haven't there been why
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't there been the move to this type
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
of instruction until the past year or
 
01:54:49.199 --> 01:54:50.390 align:start position:0%
of instruction until the past year or
two

01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
um but you know we could discuss that an
 
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
hour or later also thank you very much
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open up the questions right
 
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
now representative have your hand up I'm
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
going to have to leave at this point in
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
time reps in my own would you take over
 
01:55:03.649 --> 01:55:03.659 align:start position:0%
a second while I'm
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Morrow has been chair of
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
this committee and uh so I asked I
 
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
should be back by
 
01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:12.950 align:start position:0%
should be back by
um

01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
by about uh 11 15 hopefully
 
01:55:18.239 --> 01:55:19.810 align:start position:0%
by about uh 11 15 hopefully
hopefully

01:55:19.810 --> 01:55:19.820 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
one other thing we do not have any other
 
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
pink cards on this
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
are there any other pink cards for this
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
or is represent cordelli the only one
 
01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
speaking this bill
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like he's the only one so we
 
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
01:55:39.709 --> 01:55:39.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
01:55:43.090 --> 01:55:43.100 align:start position:0%
wondering are there
 
01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
materials uh out there
 
01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
for parents who themselves can't read or
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
can't read well
 
01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
so that they can you know in that
 
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
section where we're asking the parents
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
to be working with their students are
 
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
there materials that they can do
 
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
even when they're they have the same
 
01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:06.470 align:start position:0%
even when they're they have the same
issue

01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:56:09.290 --> 01:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
I I would think that through Adult Ed
 
01:56:12.290 --> 01:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
programs through various other programs
 
01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
but that could well be a side benefit to
 
01:56:19.010 --> 01:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
this whole initiative
 
01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:24.020 align:start position:0%
um is having parents realizing gee I
 
01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
don't read so well either and maybe I
 
01:56:30.890 --> 01:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
need to to brush up on my skills in that
 
01:56:33.290 --> 01:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
area so that that could definitely be a
 
01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
side benefit to this to this effort
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
thank you other other question
 
01:56:40.669 --> 01:56:40.679 align:start position:0%
representative uh Tanner uh thank you
 
01:56:42.530 --> 01:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and I'm
 
01:56:44.450 --> 01:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
I when I saw this bill I was kind of
 
01:56:46.010 --> 01:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
worried of how it was going to affect
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
the other dyslexic uh testing bill that
 
01:56:52.609 --> 01:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
we had 377 so be interested to talk with
 
01:56:54.290 --> 01:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
you about that
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
um but I have a couple of questions
 
01:56:58.370 --> 01:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
about this one one is you keep talking
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
about the science of reading and usually
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about when we're
 
01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
initiating kind of testing and programs
 
01:57:09.649 --> 01:57:09.659 align:start position:0%
like this we talk about best practices
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
um that leaves a little bit more open is
 
01:57:15.530 --> 01:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
is there a reason that you keep pushing
 
01:57:17.450 --> 01:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
the science of reading rather than best
 
01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:19.669 align:start position:0%
the science of reading rather than best
practices

01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
um I think what his term the science of
 
01:57:27.890 --> 01:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
reading does involve best practices it's
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
all evidence-based research that has
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
been gathered and uh all the states that
 
01:57:36.169 --> 01:57:36.179 align:start position:0%
have an issued initiated programs in the
 
01:57:38.089 --> 01:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
past several years
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
um as well as many others are moving to
 
01:57:43.450 --> 01:57:43.460 align:start position:0%
the science of reading and um
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
I'll try and
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
remember to send out this this chart of
 
01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
all 50 states uh to you as a matter of
 
01:57:53.229 --> 01:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
fact in many states that have
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
implemented literacy programs they are
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
holding back children from going into
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
the fourth grade
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
um who if they are not proficient in
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
Reading I I didn't go that direction in
 
01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
this bill but a number of states are
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
doing that and just allowing for
 
01:58:15.119 --> 01:58:16.250 align:start position:0%
doing that and just allowing for
exemptions

01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
01:58:18.970 --> 01:58:18.980 align:start position:0%
um for some children not to be held back
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
but the science of reading I think is
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
best practices and I try to incorporate
 
01:58:26.109 --> 01:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
into this
 
01:58:29.209 --> 01:58:29.219 align:start position:0%
many components that I saw in
 
01:58:31.149 --> 01:58:31.159 align:start position:0%
legislation from
 
01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
other states that have implemented
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
successful programs Mississippi has
 
01:58:40.370 --> 01:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
widely been acclaimed for their
 
01:58:43.370 --> 01:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
initiatives in this area and the results
 
01:58:47.050 --> 01:58:47.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.669 --> 01:58:48.679 align:start position:0%
so so
 
01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
my question was I guess in the past
 
01:58:54.770 --> 01:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
we've we've kind of shied away from
 
01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
designating a specific
 
01:58:57.900 --> 01:58:59.930 align:start position:0%
designating a specific
program

01:58:59.930 --> 01:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
um and use the term best practices and
 
01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:03.770 align:start position:0%
um and use the term best practices and
so

01:59:03.770 --> 01:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:07.970 --> 01:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
is is the science of reading a
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
program that's put out by a corporation
 
01:59:14.450 --> 01:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
or is it uh is is it a set curriculum
 
01:59:16.970 --> 01:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
kind of thing or is it I mean it sounds
 
01:59:19.370 --> 01:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
good science of reading but
 
01:59:21.050 --> 01:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
um I know from teaching when we got
 
01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
locked into a certain type of reading
 
01:59:26.330 --> 01:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
that uh program for kids all of a sudden
 
01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
a bunch of kids couldn't read and same
 
01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
thing with math when we got locked into
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
one math program that was nationally
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
ranked you know another one so
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
um best practices is what we've normally
 
01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
gone to right thank you
 
01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:41.030 align:start position:0%
gone to right thank you
um

01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes I the science of reading is not a
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
product from any particular publisher
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's really a concept based on the
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
research that has been gathered and the
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
um uh primary components which are
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
listed on the page top of
 
01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:01.010 align:start position:0%
listed on the page top of
um

02:00:01.010 --> 02:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
I thought it was page two maybe it's top
 
02:00:04.729 --> 02:00:04.739 align:start position:0%
of Page Three
 
02:00:04.739 --> 02:00:05.570 align:start position:0%
of Page Three
um

02:00:05.570 --> 02:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
that make up the science of reading and
 
02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:10.490 align:start position:0%
that make up the science of reading and
so

02:00:10.490 --> 02:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:13.970 --> 02:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
um yeah go ahead sorry yes follow-up
 
02:00:16.729 --> 02:00:16.739 align:start position:0%
um just a another completely different
 
02:00:19.129 --> 02:00:19.139 align:start position:0%
question but when I saw your bill and
 
02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
also from working with Katie on the
 
02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
other one
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering why we wait till third
 
02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
grade to give the the school's money
 
02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
rather than wouldn't it be great if when
 
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
the student is identified and
 
02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
interventions are necessary that at that
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
time that the school could apply even if
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
it had to be just on a yearly basis but
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
they could apply for the funds at that
 
02:00:46.729 --> 02:00:46.739 align:start position:0%
time to help the student out rather than
 
02:00:49.129 --> 02:00:49.139 align:start position:0%
waiting to third grade and saying oh you
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
know we didn't help 50 kids so we need
 
02:00:54.649 --> 02:00:54.659 align:start position:0%
this amount of Grant um so we're keying
 
02:00:55.729 --> 02:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
the money
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
to the specific
 
02:01:00.290 --> 02:01:00.300 align:start position:0%
um problem rather than waiting till
 
02:01:01.729 --> 02:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
third grade and collecting the
 
02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:03.500 align:start position:0%
non-readers together
 
02:01:06.169 --> 02:01:06.179 align:start position:0%
in the reading Improvement Grant you're
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
speaking of
 
02:01:08.930 --> 02:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
um I I think it does say third grade
 
02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:10.070 align:start position:0%
um I I think it does say third grade
students

02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
um but um I would be open to discussing
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
um you know something earlier than that
 
02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:01:20.209 --> 02:01:20.219 align:start position:0%
I do have a question uh representative
 
02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:23.219 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you for all the
 
02:01:24.649 --> 02:01:24.659 align:start position:0%
information you've provided obviously
 
02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
you've done a lot of work and background
 
02:01:28.010 --> 02:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
and it's much appreciated
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh the query that I have or maybe two uh
 
02:01:35.810 --> 02:01:35.820 align:start position:0%
this committee has been reluctant
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
to pass legislation that dictates a
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
specific form of instruction
 
02:01:48.050 --> 02:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
my presumption here is that if this if
 
02:01:52.129 --> 02:01:52.139 align:start position:0%
uh 437 were in a pass
 
02:01:56.330 --> 02:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
this would then provide the reading
 
02:01:56.340 --> 02:01:57.890 align:start position:0%
this would then provide the reading
component

02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
component
 
02:02:01.070 --> 02:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
for the state is that correct is that
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
how you view this
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
um I I think for some districts that are
 
02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
using older techniques it might be a
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
shift in their reading instruction but I
 
02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
think that based on all the research and
 
02:02:20.450 --> 02:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
what we've seen happen in in literacy
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
around the country I think it's a shift
 
02:02:25.129 --> 02:02:25.139 align:start position:0%
that needs to take place
 
02:02:28.129 --> 02:02:28.139 align:start position:0%
and thank you um if I could just add one
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that
 
02:02:30.239 --> 02:02:31.010 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that
um

02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
as you'll see in some of the exhibits it
 
02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
really is a follow-on to something that
 
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
the department has already started with
 
02:02:39.770 --> 02:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
their literacy programs and training of
 
02:02:42.890 --> 02:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
of teachers and students excuse me
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
students uh teachers and parents okay
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
the second of my three questions is that
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
how has this then deal with local
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
decisions that the local school
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
districts would make as as they look at
 
02:02:59.149 --> 02:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
their student population
 
02:03:02.689 --> 02:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
Etc and determine what programs they
 
02:03:04.729 --> 02:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
feel would be best How would how does
 
02:03:07.070 --> 02:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
this meet with that local control
 
02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:10.070 align:start position:0%
this meet with that local control
component

02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:11.870 --> 02:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
um I I think there there would be
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
flexibility for local districts in in
 
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
um the exact instruction and curriculum
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
related to the science of instruction
 
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
um but um there are people here from the
 
02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:24.770 align:start position:0%
um but um there are people here from the
Department

02:03:24.770 --> 02:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:03:28.189 --> 02:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
um who might be able to uh discuss that
 
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
further as well
 
02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
okay so I I just got the nod from the
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
department so I think once we once we
 
02:03:36.649 --> 02:03:36.659 align:start position:0%
get through with your questions we'll
 
02:03:38.570 --> 02:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
have the experts come through and who
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
ask them a series of questions too are
 
02:03:42.410 --> 02:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
there further questions yes uh
 
02:03:43.609 --> 02:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock and then
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative Hall followed that thank
 
02:03:48.910 --> 02:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you chairman uh I was like
 
02:03:52.129 --> 02:03:52.139 align:start position:0%
there's no question that that literacy
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
instruction is is critical this is the
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
foundational piece forever I I concur
 
02:03:57.649 --> 02:03:57.659 align:start position:0%
with you on that thank you for bringing
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
this forward
 
02:04:00.410 --> 02:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
um a couple of specific questions
 
02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
however uh on the part in in Glenn in
 
02:04:06.410 --> 02:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
section one are you talking about the uh
 
02:04:08.689 --> 02:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
K3 instruction uh line is seven and
 
02:04:10.490 --> 02:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
eight I'm assuming that's that's
 
02:04:13.490 --> 02:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
annually it didn't say annually but you
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
have on the line is that does that mean
 
02:04:17.930 --> 02:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
annually so the students we will be from
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
from a student uh analyze or screened in
 
02:04:24.109 --> 02:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
grade K or one then are also screening
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
grade two and grade three but that's
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
just one shot
 
02:04:31.070 --> 02:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh yes in in all of those um grades in
 
02:04:33.770 --> 02:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh uh line nine
 
02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
um through uh through ten
 
02:04:39.410 --> 02:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
um I I with the word repeated in there
 
02:04:40.850 --> 02:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
at mid-year at the end of the school
 
02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:41.750 align:start position:0%
at mid-year at the end of the school
year

02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I've tried to indicate through those
 
02:04:47.450 --> 02:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
grades well yeah I I understand that but
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's a year so my question is would a
 
02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
student be screened annually grades K
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
grade one grade two grade three or just
 
02:05:00.430 --> 02:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
yes and um as a matter of fact
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
um in subsequent years mid-year and the
 
02:05:10.430 --> 02:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
end of the school year past kindergarten
 
02:05:13.550 --> 02:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
um they would be screened uh twice in
 
02:05:16.729 --> 02:05:16.739 align:start position:0%
those years okay if I may if I follow up
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the fact you put in
 
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
about the dyslexia we had that piece
 
02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
before they were talking about annually
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
through grade three and that would that
 
02:05:29.930 --> 02:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:32.089 --> 02:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
um yes and I'll get copies of the
 
02:05:35.149 --> 02:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
humanity okay and the final if I may yes
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:37.490 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:05:37.490 --> 02:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:39.709 --> 02:05:39.719 align:start position:0%
they're online
 
02:05:41.689 --> 02:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
um section two now on the on your
 
02:05:43.070 --> 02:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
highlight in the Highlight is very
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
interesting I mean really well done
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you on a section two of your
 
02:05:49.070 --> 02:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
highlighted piece uh on the talking
 
02:05:51.709 --> 02:05:51.719 align:start position:0%
about line 18 and 19.
 
02:05:57.229 --> 02:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
my concern is uh not the notification uh
 
02:05:59.689 --> 02:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
my concern is reading the notifications
 
02:06:02.570 --> 02:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
multiple times within this document I'm
 
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out
 
02:06:07.609 --> 02:06:07.619 align:start position:0%
when an elementary teacher is going to
 
02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
be able to do all this
 
02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
um where you're talking four weeks every
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
four weeks it's like multiple classrooms
 
02:06:15.709 --> 02:06:15.719 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of low performing schools
 
02:06:17.930 --> 02:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
where there are multiple youngsters uh
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out their
 
02:06:23.330 --> 02:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
their at some point we take away uh
 
02:06:27.010 --> 02:06:27.020 align:start position:0%
instructional time to create paper time
 
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
and that concerns me particularly in
 
02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
schools that are under supported in
 
02:06:33.050 --> 02:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
terms of administrative assistance and
 
02:06:34.729 --> 02:06:34.739 align:start position:0%
those types of things are preparers
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
whatever I'm just concerned that we're
 
02:06:36.719 --> 02:06:38.350 align:start position:0%
whatever I'm just concerned that we're
we're

02:06:38.350 --> 02:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
we're
 
02:06:40.850 --> 02:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
not negating the need for Parental
 
02:06:42.530 --> 02:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
notification money is what I'm talking
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
about is the frequency throughout your
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
bill which which is which is multiple
 
02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
um I just don't know who is going to be
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
able to do it when when they're trying
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
to teach during that short window during
 
02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
the day for our students
 
02:06:58.010 --> 02:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
um thanks for the question I I I I think
 
02:07:00.050 --> 02:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
it could be a simple email to the
 
02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:01.189 align:start position:0%
it could be a simple email to the
parents

02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
um during that time frame but
 
02:07:05.810 --> 02:07:05.820 align:start position:0%
um this was something that
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
um I found in um multiple States
 
02:07:11.689 --> 02:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
successful States and also
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
um had reviewed by uh some national
 
02:07:19.089 --> 02:07:19.099 align:start position:0%
experts um in um reading and literacy
 
02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
who revealed this bill for me also but
 
02:07:26.089 --> 02:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
um if the committee would like to change
 
02:07:27.530 --> 02:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
the frequency
 
02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
um it's the committee's bill now last
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
one one final one thank you thank you
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's not the frequency Glenn okay I
 
02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're going to do it I
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
don't know who's going to do it I mean
 
02:07:38.330 --> 02:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
some of these other schools you may be
 
02:07:39.890 --> 02:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
cool you may have A's in the class and
 
02:07:43.010 --> 02:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
do it I just don't know how a teacher in
 
02:07:44.570 --> 02:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
today's classroom particularly in a low
 
02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
performing school with 30 kids in a
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
class is going to be able to keep up
 
02:07:49.250 --> 02:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
with this on a regular basis and do all
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
this I just think we're losing and I
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what the the give and take is
 
02:07:54.770 --> 02:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
because we're losing instructional time
 
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
time to do paper time to notify the
 
02:07:58.850 --> 02:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
parents that's all I thought that's the
 
02:08:01.729 --> 02:08:01.739 align:start position:0%
problem that I see I the concept was
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%
fine I just that makes that's my concern
 
02:08:05.450 --> 02:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure this maybe someone you've
 
02:08:06.410 --> 02:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
talked to in some of the other states
 
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
may have that answer how they do it
 
02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
would be helpful thank you thank you Mr
 
02:08:12.770 --> 02:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
chairman uh representative Hall
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon thank you for taking
 
02:08:15.770 --> 02:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:08:18.410 --> 02:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
um on lines 30 and 31 uh you identify
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
which page representations which page oh
 
02:08:21.719 --> 02:08:22.910 align:start position:0%
which page representations which page oh
page

02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
well paid one okay sorry page one uh
 
02:08:28.129 --> 02:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
what they can't do and that is the to
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
employ the three queuing System model of
 
02:08:31.850 --> 02:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
reading do you have a sense of how many
 
02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
schools districts how many school
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
districts do that now
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I I do not uh perhaps someone in the
 
02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:38.990 align:start position:0%
um I I do not uh perhaps someone in the
department

02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:08:41.450 --> 02:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
um might have a better uh idea of that
 
02:08:45.290 --> 02:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay other questions uh
 
02:08:46.669 --> 02:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:08:51.649 --> 02:08:51.659 align:start position:0%
um I've just rapidly done as much
 
02:08:53.330 --> 02:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
research as I can in a short period of
 
02:08:55.310 --> 02:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
time on this program science of reading
 
02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at their ebook
 
02:09:00.770 --> 02:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
in which uh they have an equity
 
02:09:04.490 --> 02:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
statement that promotes the teaching
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
advocacy of social justice and the
 
02:09:09.770 --> 02:09:09.780 align:start position:0%
teaching of a new social contract to
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
students so I'm wondering how much do we
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
know about this program and their and
 
02:09:16.689 --> 02:09:16.699 align:start position:0%
their efforts to push social
 
02:09:20.689 --> 02:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
programs on students uh I'm not sure
 
02:09:23.930 --> 02:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
um uh who publishes that ebook I have
 
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
not read it but I have not read anything
 
02:09:29.930 --> 02:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
like that in in other documents or nor
 
02:09:31.729 --> 02:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
in the document that I included in the
 
02:09:35.169 --> 02:09:35.179 align:start position:0%
hand app thank you thank you
 
02:09:37.550 --> 02:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
02:09:39.890 --> 02:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:09:43.850 --> 02:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
my question is there data on this
 
02:09:46.910 --> 02:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
program as how it works with students
 
02:09:49.070 --> 02:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
whose families are not speaking English
 
02:09:51.709 --> 02:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
speakers is there any evidence or
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
whatever on that
 
02:09:57.649 --> 02:09:57.659 align:start position:0%
um I I do not um but I can check with
 
02:09:59.930 --> 02:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
some of the national people that I've
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
I've worked with to see if they are
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
aware of any information in that regard
 
02:10:07.129 --> 02:10:07.139 align:start position:0%
uh representative cascadden
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
representative Leno
 
02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Myler as chair
 
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative cordelli
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
for the information it's very valid and
 
02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
literacy is definitely what kind of
 
02:10:19.609 --> 02:10:19.619 align:start position:0%
society are we going to have if we don't
 
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
have a literate population that is so
 
02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:24.410 align:start position:0%
have a literate population that is so
valid

02:10:24.410 --> 02:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
valid
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
um but you're in my area of expertise so
 
02:10:28.689 --> 02:10:28.699 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping I can help
 
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
from 1986 to 2009 I was the principal of
 
02:10:37.729 --> 02:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
two k-3 schools at the same time
 
02:10:39.729 --> 02:10:39.739 align:start position:0%
and I have to differ on science
 
02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
evidence-based reading just coming to
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
the Forefront because in the 1990s there
 
02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
were seven schools and you may be
 
02:10:48.649 --> 02:10:48.659 align:start position:0%
familiar with national reading first
 
02:10:51.530 --> 02:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
which we participated in which involved
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of training all based on the new
 
02:10:57.410 --> 02:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
sciences and evidence base of the five
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
components of reading which today are
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
still those same five components of
 
02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
phonics phonemic awareness fluency
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
comprehension and vocabulary
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to address a little
 
02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:11.209 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to address a little
bit

02:11:11.209 --> 02:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:11:11.219 --> 02:11:11.810 align:start position:0%
bit
um

02:11:11.810 --> 02:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:14.089 --> 02:11:14.099 align:start position:0%
why is state legislators are we trying
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
to act like teachers because I feel it's
 
02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
in my role previously yes this was my
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
job I needed to make sure that the
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
teachers from K to 3 assessed every
 
02:11:28.729 --> 02:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
student three times a year and those
 
02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
that struggled with academics or reading
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
skills were progress monitored and
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
parents were at the table every
 
02:11:40.850 --> 02:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
trimester or every quarter whatever the
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
school had decided so I know that
 
02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
communication is pretty tight at those
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
levels it would seem um
 
02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know I find it the teachers who
 
02:11:51.649 --> 02:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
are teaching reading and cater 3 are
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
Pre-K to three are bachelor degree in
 
02:11:57.010 --> 02:11:57.020 align:start position:0%
master's degree trained people
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
why why would you why should legislation
 
02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
get in that room and act as a teacher I
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
I just don't understand the connection
 
02:12:11.810 --> 02:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I I don't I don't I'm I'm certainly
 
02:12:14.689 --> 02:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
not trying to act as a teacher
 
02:12:14.699 --> 02:12:15.410 align:start position:0%
not trying to act as a teacher
um

02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:17.209 --> 02:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
I was a Sunday school teacher but that's
 
02:12:18.530 --> 02:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
about it
 
02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:19.610 align:start position:0%
about it
um

02:12:19.610 --> 02:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:19.970 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:12:19.970 --> 02:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:21.530 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:12:21.530 --> 02:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
it really gets into
 
02:12:28.250 --> 02:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
um why you know maybe in some areas they
 
02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:29.510 align:start position:0%
um why you know maybe in some areas they
have

02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
um progressed as you've indicated but in
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
many areas they have not they're still
 
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
um using instructional methods and uh
 
02:12:43.010 --> 02:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
books from certain Publishers who are
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
um using these older techniques
 
02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
um and one of the main Publishers who
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
um are still providing an information
 
02:13:00.490 --> 02:13:00.500 align:start position:0%
and textbooks based on some of the
 
02:13:03.589 --> 02:13:03.599 align:start position:0%
authors that you heard about under 377
 
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
Lucy Hawkins
 
02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:06.729 align:start position:0%
Lucy Hawkins
Etc

02:13:06.729 --> 02:13:06.739 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
02:13:11.209 --> 02:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
the major publisher of their works is
 
02:13:14.810 --> 02:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:15.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:17.330 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:13:17.330 --> 02:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:19.970 --> 02:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
to a large degree with
 
02:13:23.629 --> 02:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
so many things money comes into play and
 
02:13:25.970 --> 02:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
these instructional methods and
 
02:13:28.669 --> 02:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
textbooks are still being pushed around
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
the country and to Publishers it's a
 
02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:34.149 align:start position:0%
the country and to Publishers it's a
large

02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
large
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue I'm not saying that
 
02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
money is their only motive but Lucy
 
02:13:44.930 --> 02:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
Hawkins has moved on from what she
 
02:13:46.510 --> 02:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
originally said
 
02:13:50.589 --> 02:13:50.599 align:start position:0%
to embrace some of these New
 
02:13:50.599 --> 02:13:52.270 align:start position:0%
to embrace some of these New
Paths

02:13:52.270 --> 02:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
Paths
 
02:13:55.370 --> 02:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
but I'm not trying to act as a teacher
 
02:13:57.169 --> 02:13:57.179 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to make sure that New
 
02:13:57.179 --> 02:13:57.910 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to make sure that New
Hampshire

02:13:57.910 --> 02:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the state is moving in the
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
right direction with literacy
 
02:14:06.109 --> 02:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
follow up please thank you and I
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate that I understand
 
02:14:11.089 --> 02:14:11.099 align:start position:0%
the need for sure so thank you
 
02:14:11.099 --> 02:14:12.589 align:start position:0%
the need for sure so thank you
um

02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:12.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
my question goes
 
02:14:17.209 --> 02:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
um it's a little twofold with the
 
02:14:17.219 --> 02:14:18.890 align:start position:0%
um it's a little twofold with the
reporting

02:14:18.890 --> 02:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
02:14:21.169 --> 02:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
um that it that is stated would that
 
02:14:23.569 --> 02:14:23.579 align:start position:0%
include reporting for all students in
 
02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
public and private schools and home
 
02:14:27.649 --> 02:14:27.659 align:start position:0%
school students to make sure that we are
 
02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
catching all students with literacy
 
02:14:30.119 --> 02:14:31.189 align:start position:0%
catching all students with literacy
skills

02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
skills
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
and with the Department of Ed fund this
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
program because I suspect if there are
 
02:14:39.050 --> 02:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
schools still using Lucy Calkins and
 
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
faunas and Pennell that local funding is
 
02:14:44.689 --> 02:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
the difference between whether they can
 
02:14:47.569 --> 02:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
buy an updated textbook or not
 
02:14:49.550 --> 02:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
do you know there are two there are two
 
02:14:51.370 --> 02:14:51.380 align:start position:0%
parts to that question right
 
02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
one is the reporting who who has to
 
02:14:57.410 --> 02:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
report the other is the funding of it uh
 
02:14:59.930 --> 02:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative Cordell right thank you
 
02:15:04.189 --> 02:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
um yes this is um for um Public Schools
 
02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
um it does not apply uh to uh to private
 
02:15:09.290 --> 02:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
or homeschooling
 
02:15:12.609 --> 02:15:12.619 align:start position:0%
um and um in terms of
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
textbooks and instructional materials I
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
think that they're if they're still
 
02:15:18.410 --> 02:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
using some of
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
um the uh older versions
 
02:15:24.890 --> 02:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
um from Hawkins and the others
 
02:15:27.950 --> 02:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
um that there will be a gradual shift
 
02:15:33.169 --> 02:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
there is no dollars in um
 
02:15:37.609 --> 02:15:37.619 align:start position:0%
um in this bill appropriated for new
 
02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
instructional materials I I don't see
 
02:15:43.609 --> 02:15:43.619 align:start position:0%
that we often provide funding for
 
02:15:47.689 --> 02:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:49.129 --> 02:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
another problem
 
02:15:49.139 --> 02:15:50.390 align:start position:0%
another problem
yep

02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:51.970 align:start position:0%
yep
um

02:15:51.970 --> 02:15:51.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:55.729 --> 02:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
so with local control I don't understand
 
02:15:57.470 --> 02:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
why we're promoting a certain program
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
because schools have used nwea they've
 
02:16:01.490 --> 02:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
used star they've used the new Dibbles
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
acadians those are all effective
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
measures of reading
 
02:16:06.719 --> 02:16:08.930 align:start position:0%
measures of reading
um

02:16:08.930 --> 02:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.589 --> 02:16:12.599 align:start position:0%
I lost my train of thought I'm sorry
 
02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm passionate about it as you can
 
02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:15.830 align:start position:0%
um I'm passionate about it as you can
tell

02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
tell
 
02:16:18.350 --> 02:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think it's our job to be
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
doing commercials but
 
02:16:22.609 --> 02:16:22.619 align:start position:0%
um commercial programming to vendors but
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
I I think I wanted to touch on the
 
02:16:24.239 --> 02:16:26.030 align:start position:0%
I I think I wanted to touch on the
funding

02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:16:27.709 --> 02:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
and you know I come from a community
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
that you don't replace textbooks very
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
often but hopefully the teachers will
 
02:16:35.570 --> 02:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
develop materials that will be current
 
02:16:38.570 --> 02:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
um in the field which often happens in a
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
poorer District so right
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I had that right in
 
02:16:47.169 --> 02:16:47.179 align:start position:0%
terms of funding I do specify
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
in the first page there that if there is
 
02:16:54.110 --> 02:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
any costs
 
02:16:56.929 --> 02:16:56.939 align:start position:0%
to the screeners that would be
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
implemented to the local districts that
 
02:17:01.610 --> 02:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
those costs would be picked up by the
 
02:17:01.620 --> 02:17:03.830 align:start position:0%
those costs would be picked up by the
department

02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
and the department would be charged with
 
02:17:10.370 --> 02:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
coming up with an approved list of
 
02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:11.810 align:start position:0%
coming up with an approved list of
screeners

02:17:11.810 --> 02:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
screeners
 
02:17:14.209 --> 02:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
um I've looked at approved lists from
 
02:17:16.089 --> 02:17:16.099 align:start position:0%
other states
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
and there are a number including dipples
 
02:17:21.770 --> 02:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
valid screeners out there evidently that
 
02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
the department would be
 
02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
charged with identifying and then
 
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
providing if there was any cost involved
 
02:17:36.250 --> 02:17:36.260 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
I think um representative Cassie Adams
 
02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
um boa covered um my concern or my
 
02:17:47.450 --> 02:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
question uh president could you turn on
 
02:17:48.889 --> 02:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
your mic we can't hear you sorry about
 
02:17:51.410 --> 02:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
that yeah thank you thank you very much
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative Woodcock and uh and
 
02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:59.589 align:start position:0%
uh representative Woodcock and uh and
and

02:17:59.589 --> 02:17:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:59.599 --> 02:18:01.330 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:18:01.330 --> 02:18:01.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
I think representative cascadden's um
 
02:18:04.380 --> 02:18:05.690 align:start position:0%
I think representative cascadden's um
question

02:18:05.690 --> 02:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
um covered uh what I was what I was sort
 
02:18:10.129 --> 02:18:10.139 align:start position:0%
of get what I wanted to get at
 
02:18:11.330 --> 02:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
um but with respect to Universal reading
 
02:18:14.639 --> 02:18:16.310 align:start position:0%
um but with respect to Universal reading
screeners

02:18:16.310 --> 02:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
screeners
 
02:18:18.650 --> 02:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
um uh what sort of um
 
02:18:22.250 --> 02:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
standards I guess are other states using
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
to you know when developing um An
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:36.169 --> 02:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
turn on my mic I I don't recall any uh
 
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
criteria that's set out but I can
 
02:18:42.770 --> 02:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
certainly identify uh screeners that
 
02:18:45.530 --> 02:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
have been approved by other states
 
02:18:50.209 --> 02:18:50.219 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not sure the criteria and I
 
02:18:51.889 --> 02:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
probably leave that to the department to
 
02:18:51.899 --> 02:18:52.969 align:start position:0%
probably leave that to the department to
determine

02:18:52.969 --> 02:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
determine
 
02:18:54.290 --> 02:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:18:54.300 --> 02:18:55.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:58.730 --> 02:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
correctly if I the current the current
 
02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:00.589 align:start position:0%
correctly if I the current the current
uh

02:19:00.589 --> 02:19:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:02.929 --> 02:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
charge the current the grant that's
 
02:19:05.389 --> 02:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
given is for Readiness how much is that
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
now is it it's a 740 per student and is
 
02:19:13.610 --> 02:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
about 2200 uh students
 
02:19:17.330 --> 02:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
um as of 2022 so I think that the
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
reading Improvement Grant since it
 
02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:21.230 align:start position:0%
reading Improvement Grant since it
covers

02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
covers
 
02:19:23.810 --> 02:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
um pretty much all students rather than
 
02:19:25.730 --> 02:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
just a subset of the population as the
 
02:19:29.589 --> 02:19:29.599 align:start position:0%
current differentiated Aid will produce
 
02:19:32.039 --> 02:19:32.049 align:start position:0%
a substantially higher
 
02:19:32.049 --> 02:19:33.910 align:start position:0%
a substantially higher
[Music]

02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
money going to the districts
 
02:19:38.929 --> 02:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
02:19:41.089 --> 02:19:41.099 align:start position:0%
thank you and I just wanted to follow up
 
02:19:43.610 --> 02:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
on uh one of um Representatives
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
cascadden's remarks was that in the
 
02:19:48.650 --> 02:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
first part of the of the bill it says
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
all public schools and Charter Public
 
02:19:52.969 --> 02:19:52.979 align:start position:0%
Schools uh but then when it gets to the
 
02:19:55.610 --> 02:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
reporting section I noticed that that it
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
singles out each local school district
 
02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
or each School District board
 
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like uh and I I guess
 
02:20:08.929 --> 02:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
piggy backed on that is do Charter
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
Schools also receive the the grade 3
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
reading funding and if if they do
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they have to do the reporting
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:20:21.170 --> 02:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and that
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
probably was an Omission on my part in
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
terms of specifying local school boards
 
02:20:28.370 --> 02:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
and so forth um but you know we can
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
expand that to make sure that charter
 
02:20:33.650 --> 02:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
schools are covered in that
 
02:20:37.370 --> 02:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
oh do Charter Schools do receive that
 
02:20:39.309 --> 02:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
the grade three
 
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
grant for reading
 
02:20:43.490 --> 02:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
they currently do receive the
 
02:20:45.469 --> 02:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid yes
 
02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
do any of the uh private schools receive
 
02:20:52.490 --> 02:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
that or no no okay uh just a follow-up
 
02:20:54.650 --> 02:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
uh representative cordelli you'd
 
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
indicated that it was a thousand dollars
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
for students who would receive this but
 
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
isn't there something in the bill here
 
02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
that refers to just to a thousand
 
02:21:07.130 --> 02:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
um yes that's that's correct
 
02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
um and um I would certainly be open to
 
02:21:13.560 --> 02:21:15.230 align:start position:0%
um and um I would certainly be open to
expanding

02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
expanding
 
02:21:18.410 --> 02:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
um the grade levels for which that Grant
 
02:21:21.650 --> 02:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
was uh uh provided so your intent would
 
02:21:23.630 --> 02:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
be to provide it for any student that
 
02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
who's under this program to receive that
 
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
Grant not just third graders I I would
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh not have a problem with expanding
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
that correct thank you further questions
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
from the committee uh representative
 
02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:39.950 align:start position:0%
from the committee uh representative
Damon

02:21:39.950 --> 02:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
Damon
 
02:21:41.570 --> 02:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:21:43.130 --> 02:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
so you indicated that we don't know the
 
02:21:49.130 --> 02:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
number of schools that are doing the
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
three queuing approach in New Hampshire
 
02:21:52.250 --> 02:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to
 
02:21:54.290 --> 02:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
do we know the number of schools who are
 
02:21:57.410 --> 02:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
already doing the science of reading
 
02:22:02.830 --> 02:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:06.410 --> 02:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
uh yes and that that question might be
 
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
able to be answered too by the
 
02:22:09.889 --> 02:22:09.899 align:start position:0%
department of Representatives who I'm
 
02:22:12.170 --> 02:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
sure we're going to bring up and have
 
02:22:14.690 --> 02:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
other have an in exchange with them
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative cascad thank you it'd be
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
a short one
 
02:22:20.270 --> 02:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you so we know that brain
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
development is at its most rapid Pace
 
02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
from birth to age five
 
02:22:27.770 --> 02:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
and I guess you you've worked
 
02:22:30.050 --> 02:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
extensively on this k-3
 
02:22:32.690 --> 02:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
um which is very valid of course
 
02:22:34.610 --> 02:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
but I I'm wondering do you know if
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's any such work being done for a
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
universal preschool or children at age
 
02:22:41.870 --> 02:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
three and four with a pre-reading skills
 
02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:42.889 align:start position:0%
three and four with a pre-reading skills
really

02:22:42.889 --> 02:22:42.899 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:22:45.290 --> 02:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
would start I would think that would be
 
02:22:48.410 --> 02:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
the precursor to some of this do you do
 
02:22:49.969 --> 02:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:22:52.910 --> 02:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm not aware of any but there might
 
02:22:55.309 --> 02:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
be some going on and actually that just
 
02:22:58.250 --> 02:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
triggered thought and I would have
 
02:22:59.929 --> 02:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
actually liked I would like to see
 
02:23:03.290 --> 02:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
whether it's this bill or in the budget
 
02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
um actually an appropriation to New
 
02:23:08.590 --> 02:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Libraries
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
to expand summer reading programs yeah
 
02:23:13.370 --> 02:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
I've talked to the children's librarian
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
further further questions
 
02:23:22.849 --> 02:23:22.859 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative cordelli for
 
02:23:25.610 --> 02:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
bringing this before this committee now
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
we have representatives from the
 
02:23:27.359 --> 02:23:28.370 align:start position:0%
we have representatives from the
Department

02:23:28.370 --> 02:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh could you come up and see if he might
 
02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
be able to provide some resources for us
 
02:23:34.730 --> 02:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
as we look at this bill
 
02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
good morning Melissa white division
 
02:23:42.830 --> 02:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
director for learner support at the
 
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
02:23:47.690 --> 02:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
athlete McCaffrey the ELA consultant for
 
02:23:51.290 --> 02:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
so I have let me start with a question
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh obviously this is a pretty uh very
 
02:23:58.250 --> 02:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
comprehensive proposal that before us in
 
02:24:01.969 --> 02:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
uh 437. could you give us just an
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
overview of the current status of
 
02:24:07.849 --> 02:24:07.859 align:start position:0%
reading programs within the state and
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
also specifically what the department is
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
doing now to provide resources to school
 
02:24:15.050 --> 02:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
districts on reading
 
02:24:19.130 --> 02:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
so um I I think one thing to clarify is
 
02:24:21.710 --> 02:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
that the local control will still exist
 
02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
with when we're talking about reading
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
instructions so tier one reading
 
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
instruction instruction that is for all
 
02:24:31.309 --> 02:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
students is decided at local control and
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
that will remain there this proposed
 
02:24:36.889 --> 02:24:36.899 align:start position:0%
legislation is specifically targeting
 
02:24:38.750 --> 02:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
the students that are needing an
 
02:24:40.910 --> 02:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
intervention the students that are
 
02:24:43.610 --> 02:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
exhibiting or reading deficiency so when
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
we talk about a reading program those
 
02:24:50.570 --> 02:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
schools can continue to utilize their
 
02:24:53.090 --> 02:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
existing programs it doesn't necessarily
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
have to be science of reading based that
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're providing at tier one they can
 
02:24:59.570 --> 02:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
decide that locally but when we're
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the students that are
 
02:25:04.610 --> 02:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
exhibiting the the most need for an
 
02:25:08.450 --> 02:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
intervention for reading then where this
 
02:25:10.190 --> 02:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation is stating that
 
02:25:12.349 --> 02:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
should be based in the science of
 
02:25:14.929 --> 02:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
reading but they can continue to decide
 
02:25:17.450 --> 02:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
how that tier one or that General level
 
02:25:21.170 --> 02:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
instruction would work so I I wanted to
 
02:25:23.150 --> 02:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
just make that differentiation between
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's not all of the students who would
 
02:25:29.690 --> 02:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
be receiving that necessarily that can
 
02:25:32.570 --> 02:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
still be decided among the teachers the
 
02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
parents the community school board and
 
02:25:37.550 --> 02:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
administration it's the targeted
 
02:25:39.889 --> 02:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
students that we are focusing on meeting
 
02:25:42.290 --> 02:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
a specific intervention that should be
 
02:25:43.969 --> 02:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
based on the science of reading so I
 
02:25:46.490 --> 02:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that clear currently
 
02:25:47.870 --> 02:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
um there is a mix
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
across the state we have many schools
 
02:25:52.090 --> 02:25:52.100 align:start position:0%
that are using
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
tier one materials or their tier one
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
instruction is based in the science of
 
02:26:01.010 --> 02:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
reading other schools may not be and so
 
02:26:03.770 --> 02:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
it really does vary the Department of
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
Education really
 
02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:06.830 align:start position:0%
Education really
um

02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:09.770 --> 02:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
and I think for me personally to one of
 
02:26:11.809 --> 02:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
the the impetus of going to work for the
 
02:26:13.849 --> 02:26:13.859 align:start position:0%
Department was because of reading and
 
02:26:15.410 --> 02:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
reading instruction across the state and
 
02:26:18.730 --> 02:26:18.740 align:start position:0%
this passion to increase that
 
02:26:21.290 --> 02:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
those resources and that knowledge and
 
02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
that training and so
 
02:26:26.270 --> 02:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
fortunately with covert relief funds we
 
02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
were able to have the funding to start
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
to implement a lot of that programming
 
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
and that's where I lean into literacy
 
02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
initiative came in where we were able to
 
02:26:37.730 --> 02:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
look at science of reading providing
 
02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:38.950 align:start position:0%
look at science of reading providing
instruction

02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
02:26:40.849 --> 02:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
and professional development
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities Statewide to all teachers
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
and also for Early Childhood Educators
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
as well parents and any Librarians
 
02:26:52.190 --> 02:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
anyone that was interested are working
 
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
with students that wanted to be a part
 
02:26:56.030 --> 02:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
of that training so we don't require it
 
02:26:58.370 --> 02:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
but we do make it available
 
02:26:58.380 --> 02:26:59.630 align:start position:0%
but we do make it available
for

02:26:59.630 --> 02:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
um Educators that do complete the entire
 
02:27:05.929 --> 02:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
program it's a rather extensive program
 
02:27:07.969 --> 02:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
taking about two years
 
02:27:10.190 --> 02:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
they are then able to earn a stipend
 
02:27:12.170 --> 02:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
they'll have a micro credential that
 
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that they have completed
 
02:27:16.490 --> 02:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
this training so that we have tried to
 
02:27:19.010 --> 02:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
create as many incentives as possible to
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
Garner interest to Garner participation
 
02:27:25.130 --> 02:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
for this programming but again we're not
 
02:27:28.490 --> 02:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
requiring it and they may participate as
 
02:27:30.410 --> 02:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
needed in addition we are also training
 
02:27:32.570 --> 02:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
administrators so that they have a
 
02:27:34.670 --> 02:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
special training that's just for
 
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
administrators in our communities to
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
really focus on what is science of
 
02:27:42.429 --> 02:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
reading look like in in the classroom
 
02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
tier one and then what would it also
 
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
look like for interventions how can you
 
02:27:48.650 --> 02:27:48.660 align:start position:0%
be going into the classroom and making
 
02:27:48.660 --> 02:27:49.570 align:start position:0%
be going into the classroom and making
sure

02:27:49.570 --> 02:27:49.580 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
school-wide that students that are
 
02:27:54.410 --> 02:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
demonstrating a specific need for
 
02:27:55.969 --> 02:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
reading intervention are receiving those
 
02:27:55.979 --> 02:27:56.990 align:start position:0%
reading intervention are receiving those
services

02:27:56.990 --> 02:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:27:59.630 --> 02:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
a question could you Define Tier what
 
02:28:01.849 --> 02:28:01.859 align:start position:0%
tier one is sure tier one is instruction
 
02:28:04.490 --> 02:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
for everybody okay tier two is then when
 
02:28:07.250 --> 02:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
you start to kind of go up the tiers
 
02:28:10.130 --> 02:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
um levels of intervention needed to
 
02:28:10.140 --> 02:28:10.790 align:start position:0%
um levels of intervention needed to
um

02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:12.830 --> 02:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
kind of make up that deficiency that
 
02:28:14.570 --> 02:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
we're seeing okay but thank you very
 
02:28:17.090 --> 02:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
much or any other questions yes uh
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell thank you so
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers would be able to use
 
02:28:23.809 --> 02:28:23.819 align:start position:0%
whatever the district used for reading
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
until it was discovered that a student
 
02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
needed more and then that same classroom
 
02:28:31.490 --> 02:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
teacher would have to know
 
02:28:33.950 --> 02:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
science of reading and be using the
 
02:28:36.650 --> 02:28:36.660 align:start position:0%
regular District readings program and
 
02:28:38.330 --> 02:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
then the other one for their other
 
02:28:40.969 --> 02:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
students so that's a locally decided
 
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
decision if the administration locally
 
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
decided they wanted the classroom
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
teacher to give that intervention in the
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
classroom then that would be for them to
 
02:28:50.889 --> 02:28:50.899 align:start position:0%
determine if they wanted their reading
 
02:28:52.730 --> 02:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
interventionists or their reading
 
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
specialist teacher to provide that
 
02:28:57.170 --> 02:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
intervention then they would have that
 
02:28:59.210 --> 02:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
person do it so it's really up to local
 
02:29:01.870 --> 02:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
control who provides the intervention
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
all this I think and this is my
 
02:29:06.349 --> 02:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this legislation
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
is just proposing that the students be
 
02:29:10.670 --> 02:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
screened and then if they're identified
 
02:29:13.370 --> 02:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
a plan be implemented to meet that that
 
02:29:15.650 --> 02:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
need and the instruction being provided
 
02:29:17.809 --> 02:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
or the intervention be based in the
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
science of reading so they could use any
 
02:29:24.530 --> 02:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
intervention that was based in that
 
02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
there's multiple products out there it's
 
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
not just science of reading as one
 
02:29:31.849 --> 02:29:31.859 align:start position:0%
program or one product you go buy out
 
02:29:34.130 --> 02:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
the Shelf there's the ability for a
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
teacher to develop their own materials
 
02:29:41.210 --> 02:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
based on science of reading it's not a
 
02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:50.030 --> 02:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
um do you see a benefit
 
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
of changing the funding for the reading
 
02:29:55.730 --> 02:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
interventions from
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
a grant in third grade to actually tying
 
02:30:02.330 --> 02:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
it to the specific child and the when
 
02:30:04.250 --> 02:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
it's when the child is diagnosed and
 
02:30:07.490 --> 02:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
then the intervention so if if a school
 
02:30:07.500 --> 02:30:08.710 align:start position:0%
then the intervention so if if a school
had

02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
five students that were identified in
 
02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
first grade they could then reap that
 
02:30:15.950 --> 02:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
money at that first grade level to
 
02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
provide uh training and intervention
 
02:30:20.809 --> 02:30:20.819 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to determine how
 
02:30:23.570 --> 02:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
we are going to like base currently on
 
02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
the current legislation the way that
 
02:30:27.050 --> 02:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
it's set up is that it's at third grade
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
and it's based on Statewide assessment
 
02:30:32.929 --> 02:30:32.939 align:start position:0%
scores so it's one test all students
 
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
take it's it's
 
02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:36.950 align:start position:0%
take it's it's
um

02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:39.050 --> 02:30:39.060 align:start position:0%
it's easy to compare the results because
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're all taking the same test as
 
02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
02:30:45.889 --> 02:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
under third grade if you're looking at K
 
02:30:48.170 --> 02:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
to two there's multiple tests being
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
offered at the local level multiple
 
02:30:53.450 --> 02:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
tests are not necessarily comparable so
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
02:30:57.530 --> 02:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
um important to clarify how we're going
 
02:31:01.250 --> 02:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
to ascertain what that deficiency is K
 
02:31:03.530 --> 02:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
to and what tools will we be using will
 
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
it be based on the screener will it be
 
02:31:07.490 --> 02:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
based on another assessment so I think
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's just the part that would need to
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
be clarified
 
02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:11.450 align:start position:0%
be clarified
um

02:31:11.450 --> 02:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:13.429 --> 02:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to then determine how
 
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
to move forward to calculate whether it
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
would be K to two because right now
 
02:31:21.650 --> 02:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
we're set up to assess third grade we
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
get that results we can go in and look
 
02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
at that data at the department schools
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
look at it as well parents can see it so
 
02:31:30.830 --> 02:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's something that's a little bit
 
02:31:33.050 --> 02:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
more level because we're all using the
 
02:31:34.250 --> 02:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
same tool
 
02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh follow up please follow up um
 
02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:39.590 align:start position:0%
uh follow up please follow up um
so

02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:41.750 --> 02:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
our Charter Schools our Charter Schools
 
02:31:44.889 --> 02:31:44.899 align:start position:0%
required to administer that third grade
 
02:31:48.830 --> 02:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
test and and I noticed that in the
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
statistics like uh the Academy of Arts
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
and Sciences doesn't have any reporting
 
02:31:56.510 --> 02:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
on their reading proficiency
 
02:31:59.030 --> 02:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so at the higher levels
 
02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:00.110 align:start position:0%
um so at the higher levels
um

02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:02.030 --> 02:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm just worried that we're missing
 
02:32:04.010 --> 02:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
kids and that we're not adequately
 
02:32:05.929 --> 02:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
funding in that we're
 
02:32:07.849 --> 02:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
we're really putting a lot of pressure
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
on local schools to come up with money
 
02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
and time
 
02:32:14.750 --> 02:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
that that really needs to be looked at
 
02:32:17.030 --> 02:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the grand scheme of things thank you
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
for that question so all students in
 
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
public and public chartered schools are
 
02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
required to take reading and Ela
 
02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
assessments third through eighth grade
 
02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
and then we take it again an 11th grade
 
02:32:31.790 --> 02:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
utilizing the SAT
 
02:32:34.910 --> 02:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
science is assessed at 5th and 8th and
 
02:32:36.050 --> 02:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
11th grade
 
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
and it's utilizing the New Hampshire SAS
 
02:32:40.130 --> 02:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
assessment our New Hampshire Statewide
 
02:32:41.630 --> 02:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
assessment system so all of those
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
schools including the Academy of Arts
 
02:32:46.730 --> 02:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
and Design are required to take that
 
02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:48.349 align:start position:0%
and Design are required to take that
assessment

02:32:48.349 --> 02:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:32:52.190 --> 02:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh okay since uh yes uh representative
 
02:32:54.050 --> 02:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
Cornell Thank you thank you for taking
 
02:32:56.750 --> 02:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
another question do all schools have a
 
02:32:59.330 --> 02:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
reading special specialist on staff does
 
02:33:01.849 --> 02:33:01.859 align:start position:0%
every school have one that I don't know
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
the answer to that I know that there are
 
02:33:07.370 --> 02:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
requirements that are specific to
 
02:33:09.410 --> 02:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
certifying to be a reading specialist
 
02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure if all schools have a
 
02:33:12.530 --> 02:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
reading specialist
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:17.929 --> 02:33:17.939 align:start position:0%
um I have one last question
 
02:33:17.939 --> 02:33:19.610 align:start position:0%
um I have one last question
currently

02:33:19.610 --> 02:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:33:22.910 --> 02:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
when a child is uh
 
02:33:26.750 --> 02:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
being not proficient and is uh receives
 
02:33:28.849 --> 02:33:28.859 align:start position:0%
a grant the school district receives a
 
02:33:28.859 --> 02:33:29.870 align:start position:0%
a grant the school district receives a
grant

02:33:29.870 --> 02:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
grant
 
02:33:31.969 --> 02:33:31.979 align:start position:0%
there's been some questions under the
 
02:33:33.530 --> 02:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
current system
 
02:33:37.610 --> 02:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
of how school districts use that Grant
 
02:33:40.490 --> 02:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
and if in fact they even use the grant
 
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
for what it was intended to
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that under uh 437
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is more targeted with greater
 
02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:54.230 align:start position:0%
that is more targeted with greater
reporting

02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
02:33:57.469 --> 02:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
on how those funds are being used would
 
02:33:59.210 --> 02:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
you agree with that with my assessment
 
02:34:00.590 --> 02:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:34:04.250 --> 02:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that it's
 
02:34:07.969 --> 02:34:07.979 align:start position:0%
currently tacked on to the correct uh
 
02:34:12.349 --> 02:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
the student aid right so I would think
 
02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
that it's all accounted for as one
 
02:34:19.070 --> 02:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
amount of like one chunk of money right
 
02:34:21.290 --> 02:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term
 
02:34:24.410 --> 02:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
um so that's my understanding if this is
 
02:34:27.170 --> 02:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
setting it up to be a like a specific
 
02:34:30.770 --> 02:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
Grant that's not tied to student aid
 
02:34:32.510 --> 02:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
then I think we would just have to
 
02:34:35.150 --> 02:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
clarify what all of the uh requirements
 
02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:37.140 align:start position:0%
would be for us to
 
02:34:37.140 --> 02:34:39.170 align:start position:0%
would be for us to
um

02:34:39.170 --> 02:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:41.090 --> 02:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
account for that that piece of it if
 
02:34:43.969 --> 02:34:43.979 align:start position:0%
it's being distributed as a grant
 
02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
versus student aid those are two
 
02:34:49.429 --> 02:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
separate instructions we get that
 
02:34:51.170 --> 02:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
clarified I think when we are an exec
 
02:34:53.210 --> 02:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
session so thank you other further
 
02:34:56.150 --> 02:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
questions of the department
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
not appearing thank you for the
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you for being here
 
02:35:01.490 --> 02:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the work you do in
 
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
helping school districts
 
02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there uh
 
02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
oh yes uh could you also fill out a pink
 
02:35:11.929 --> 02:35:11.939 align:start position:0%
card so we can have that for uh the
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
clerk please thank you uh any further
 
02:35:16.910 --> 02:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
questions on uh 437
 
02:35:20.929 --> 02:35:20.939 align:start position:0%
uh then we'll declare this closed
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%

introduce it probably gonna do so well I
 
02:35:51.479 --> 02:35:52.490 align:start position:0%
introduce it probably gonna do so well I
think

02:35:52.490 --> 02:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:35:55.490 --> 02:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
I think one should probably introduce it
 
02:36:03.770 --> 02:36:03.780 align:start position:0%

and I'm here today to introduce
 
02:37:35.929 --> 02:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
HB 542 and I'm sure representative Myler
 
02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
could have done just as great a job as I
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
am on this one uh seeing we have worked
 
02:37:43.730 --> 02:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
on this uh during our discussions with
 
02:37:45.710 --> 02:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and you as
 
02:37:47.809 --> 02:37:47.819 align:start position:0%
you may recall we had an orientation
 
02:37:51.410 --> 02:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
over with uh Nate green who is dealing
 
02:37:54.770 --> 02:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
with uh various data that we have in I
 
02:37:56.570 --> 02:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
platform does that ring any bells for
 
02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
people and then the various components
 
02:38:02.690 --> 02:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
within and I platform is a wonderful
 
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
move going forward and Michael Schultz
 
02:38:07.630 --> 02:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
has helped do that
 
02:38:10.429 --> 02:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
and both and that's a contracted service
 
02:38:13.450 --> 02:38:13.460 align:start position:0%
of doe not a doe staff member Michael
 
02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
and what we need to do now is that we
 
02:38:19.730 --> 02:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
need to take this deep dive into what we
 
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
have as far as analyzing this data that
 
02:38:24.530 --> 02:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
we have available to us and making it
 
02:38:26.510 --> 02:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
available to the public but more
 
02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
importantly I believe is making it
 
02:38:31.309 --> 02:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
available in in an understandable manner
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
to the local school districts and
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
training school districts District staff
 
02:38:38.650 --> 02:38:38.660 align:start position:0%
and how to use this in better supporting
 
02:38:42.110 --> 02:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
our curricular and instructional needs
 
02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
that we may have in the state a lot of
 
02:38:45.650 --> 02:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
good things which we are doing in our
 
02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
our scores compared to the nation are
 
02:38:50.809 --> 02:38:50.819 align:start position:0%
fine but they are not what New Hampshire
 
02:38:53.210 --> 02:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
expects New Hampshire always wants to be
 
02:38:55.550 --> 02:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
at the top of how we're achieving and
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
with our kids ready going going on for a
 
02:38:59.870 --> 02:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
career Readiness and with a pathway with
 
02:39:02.510 --> 02:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
a skill and going into post-secondary
 
02:39:04.429 --> 02:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
education and not having to spend a lot
 
02:39:06.410 --> 02:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
of money in remediation
 
02:39:08.750 --> 02:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
rather than if we're looking at the area
 
02:39:11.090 --> 02:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
mathematics which we know that that's an
 
02:39:13.190 --> 02:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
area that's critical and a critical
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
issue throughout this country
 
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
and within New Hampshire and coming out
 
02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
with a a good ability of how to apply
 
02:39:23.870 --> 02:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
and use mathematics we've talked about
 
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
this the Maya math learning communities
 
02:39:30.170 --> 02:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
but I after meeting with several groups
 
02:39:32.030 --> 02:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
now another one since I met with the
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
folks down at Fairlee and Vermont and
 
02:39:37.370 --> 02:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
Orford New Hampshire it's an interstate
 
02:39:39.170 --> 02:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
government District governmental
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
district for Education that we need to
 
02:39:45.530 --> 02:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
be working with these teachers and in
 
02:39:48.650 --> 02:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
administrators in the schools so that
 
02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
they don't go back and just reinvent
 
02:39:53.889 --> 02:39:53.899 align:start position:0%
everything in a very at a huge cost
 
02:39:56.510 --> 02:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
mathematics we may be doing 90 percent
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
what we need to but there the other 10
 
02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
percent needs some help and that may be
 
02:40:04.010 --> 02:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
what's bringing down our achievements
 
02:40:06.170 --> 02:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
course there's a lot to this
 
02:40:09.469 --> 02:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
so if we have somebody that's paid at
 
02:40:11.570 --> 02:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
the department whether the first year I
 
02:40:13.969 --> 02:40:13.979 align:start position:0%
believe was 160 000 and it drops down
 
02:40:17.090 --> 02:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
the second year to about 147 000 that's
 
02:40:19.010 --> 02:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
because the equipment and much of that
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
has already been purchased the second
 
02:40:20.399 --> 02:40:21.349 align:start position:0%
has already been purchased the second
year

02:40:21.349 --> 02:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:40:24.770 --> 02:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
that person that Doe will help us to
 
02:40:28.910 --> 02:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
delve down into the nuts and bolts of
 
02:40:31.010 --> 02:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
where students are in terms of specific
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
elements within mathematics be it
 
02:40:36.050 --> 02:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
geometry trigonometry calculus general
 
02:40:39.410 --> 02:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
math algebra one two and so this person
 
02:40:42.770 --> 02:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
is needed the department sees this as a
 
02:40:46.790 --> 02:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
as a primary goal to try and provide the
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
support for uh Nick green over there to
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
deal with and analyze this data
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
so you got to understand too at the
 
02:40:58.429 --> 02:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
figures I'm going to guess a little bit
 
02:41:01.190 --> 02:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
here that of those employed over at the
 
02:41:03.050 --> 02:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Education close to 80
 
02:41:04.370 --> 02:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
percent of those are paid through
 
02:41:06.770 --> 02:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
Federal monies and what we're doing on
 
02:41:08.690 --> 02:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
the our side is appropriating dollars
 
02:41:11.389 --> 02:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
for doe to operate it's very thin and
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
skinny and this is where we can help out
 
02:41:17.929 --> 02:41:17.939 align:start position:0%
where we need to put the the our
 
02:41:20.570 --> 02:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
priority issues and I believe that I I
 
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
agree of course with the Department this
 
02:41:26.809 --> 02:41:26.819 align:start position:0%
data analysis individual is is really
 
02:41:28.610 --> 02:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
needed we've been sitting on top of a
 
02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
lot of information how many times I
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
called over doe trying to get
 
02:41:34.849 --> 02:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
information from them about students our
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
performance and curriculum or
 
02:41:38.450 --> 02:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
instruction and I just don't get the
 
02:41:40.309 --> 02:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
answer they don't have it we don't
 
02:41:43.010 --> 02:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
compile that we don't do that I've tried
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
to even in when we had the commission
 
02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
that represented Miler chaired on the
 
02:41:50.809 --> 02:41:50.819 align:start position:0%
commission for for funding adequacy we
 
02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
were asking some questions in terms of
 
02:41:54.770 --> 02:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education or in terms
 
02:41:54.780 --> 02:41:56.110 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education or in terms
of

02:41:56.110 --> 02:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:42:00.290 --> 02:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
areas that of curriculum and we did not
 
02:42:04.190 --> 02:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
get all the information we needed yes we
 
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
were able to get National figures but
 
02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes the data was just not
 
02:42:11.389 --> 02:42:11.399 align:start position:0%
available so we had to rely upon those
 
02:42:13.849 --> 02:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
areas and determining what the average
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education was of
 
02:42:19.490 --> 02:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
what data the the department had
 
02:42:20.929 --> 02:42:20.939 align:start position:0%
it may have been out in the school
 
02:42:22.670 --> 02:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
districts but it wasn't available on the
 
02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
on the department level so in closing
 
02:42:28.210 --> 02:42:28.220 align:start position:0%
we're we're really needing this position
 
02:42:30.889 --> 02:42:30.899 align:start position:0%
uh I think at the primary end of this
 
02:42:32.450 --> 02:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
thing is that we're going to be helping
 
02:42:34.190 --> 02:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
education and helping our students
 
02:42:36.830 --> 02:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
better succeed with this help of an
 
02:42:38.510 --> 02:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
additional analyst over at the
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
I'll be God take any questions if you
 
02:42:44.270 --> 02:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
haven't uh thank you representative any
 
02:42:47.090 --> 02:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
questions for the uh chairman uh
 
02:42:49.490 --> 02:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:50.630 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
chair

02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:42:51.710 --> 02:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to see some
 
02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
clarification on the on the role of this
 
02:42:55.610 --> 02:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
position is this
 
02:42:59.809 --> 02:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
is this purely supposed to be a data
 
02:43:01.969 --> 02:43:01.979 align:start position:0%
um numbers position or is there an
 
02:43:04.250 --> 02:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
advocacy and enforcement role in this
 
02:43:08.210 --> 02:43:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:10.370 --> 02:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
this person is a person's going to be
 
02:43:12.710 --> 02:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
working directly with Nate Green in that
 
02:43:15.710 --> 02:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
department analyzing this data and also
 
02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
available and gives more time for either
 
02:43:20.090 --> 02:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
Nate or the individual hired to work
 
02:43:22.130 --> 02:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
with school districts perhaps even get
 
02:43:25.610 --> 02:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
to these School Districts The whole idea
 
02:43:27.050 --> 02:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
behind that is not to have another
 
02:43:30.050 --> 02:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
Hammer that the idea is to provide the
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
information to the district so they will
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
be able to make those choices and those
 
02:43:36.770 --> 02:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
decisions on a local level I don't think
 
02:43:38.809 --> 02:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
there's any District that I visited that
 
02:43:40.990 --> 02:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't want their students to achieve
 
02:43:44.270 --> 02:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
however they put the district's time
 
02:43:47.270 --> 02:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
this District I'm in right now we have a
 
02:43:48.770 --> 02:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools we have so
 
02:43:50.389 --> 02:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
many in charge special ed we have
 
02:43:54.050 --> 02:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
somebody in charge of the basic areas of
 
02:43:56.929 --> 02:43:56.939 align:start position:0%
others areas such as curriculum we don't
 
02:43:59.450 --> 02:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do what this deep
 
02:44:02.030 --> 02:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
dive that this person will be doing we
 
02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
have many small districts out there just
 
02:44:06.590 --> 02:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
don't have the expertise available and
 
02:44:08.389 --> 02:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
this will help out
 
02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative cascadden
 
02:44:19.070 --> 02:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:44:20.809 --> 02:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad I couldn't agree
 
02:44:23.630 --> 02:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
with you more in my 41 years I can't say
 
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
a time that I have not ever had support
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
guidance advice from anyone who has
 
02:44:33.290 --> 02:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
worked at the department of Ed so kudos
 
02:44:35.270 --> 02:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
to them they have a toughs job and I
 
02:44:37.490 --> 02:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
know you know with so many schools in
 
02:44:40.849 --> 02:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
the state trying to compile all of this
 
02:44:43.250 --> 02:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
information is is pretty critical
 
02:44:45.770 --> 02:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
because it gives us a Guiding Light on
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
how to move forward
 
02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
um but I ask if this person is going to
 
02:44:52.910 --> 02:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
collect Improvement performance data
 
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
would he or she
 
02:44:58.130 --> 02:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
be reaching out only to Public Schools
 
02:45:00.349 --> 02:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
or or are we looking at performance of
 
02:45:02.809 --> 02:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
all children in the state
 
02:45:04.730 --> 02:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
02:45:07.849 --> 02:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
um I wrote this bill initially to hire
 
02:45:11.950 --> 02:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
an analyst to be working with the the
 
02:45:14.809 --> 02:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
green to analyze the Statewide
 
02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
assessment and to analyze other areas of
 
02:45:21.070 --> 02:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
financial data that we have to try and
 
02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
determine where our needs are and where
 
02:45:28.490 --> 02:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
our strengths are in in achievement and
 
02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
in how we support whether it's involved
 
02:45:33.650 --> 02:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
with uh it should be involved with
 
02:45:36.889 --> 02:45:36.899 align:start position:0%
Charters Public Schools I don't Envision
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
this person being involved with private
 
02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
schools at all all right just curious
 
02:45:43.490 --> 02:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
02:45:46.309 --> 02:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you
 
02:45:48.650 --> 02:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question on
 
02:45:50.750 --> 02:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
lines eight nine I said the the position
 
02:45:53.450 --> 02:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to any other employment
 
02:45:55.250 --> 02:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
requirements as determined by the
 
02:45:57.230 --> 02:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
department does that mean the department
 
02:45:59.389 --> 02:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
can say oh we we need more help over
 
02:46:01.130 --> 02:46:01.140 align:start position:0%
here so we're just going to pull you for
 
02:46:03.349 --> 02:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
a time and usually put something else
 
02:46:05.510 --> 02:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's part of the job description that
 
02:46:09.349 --> 02:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
they put together over there and if I
 
02:46:10.849 --> 02:46:10.859 align:start position:0%
were hiring a teacher I'd put the same
 
02:46:12.889 --> 02:46:12.899 align:start position:0%
thing in the bottom line
 
02:46:12.899 --> 02:46:13.750 align:start position:0%
thing in the bottom line
um

02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:16.610 --> 02:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I think representative cascadden
 
02:46:19.250 --> 02:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
understands what I'm saying but this is
 
02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
as just standard operating sop for them
 
02:46:25.610 --> 02:46:25.620 align:start position:0%
over there you look at Amy Clark's job
 
02:46:27.950 --> 02:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
right now we know she's a building aid
 
02:46:31.309 --> 02:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
person but other things she does the the
 
02:46:34.010 --> 02:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
laundry list is long and that's because
 
02:46:34.020 --> 02:46:35.230 align:start position:0%
laundry list is long and that's because
we

02:46:35.230 --> 02:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:46:37.730 --> 02:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
we know those of us been on this
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
community for years know that we just
 
02:46:42.650 --> 02:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
have not staffed doe the way we need to
 
02:46:44.690 --> 02:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
staff when I first got here we had
 
02:46:46.610 --> 02:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks which were
 
02:46:49.130 --> 02:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
guidelines and they had been updated as
 
02:46:53.510 --> 02:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
recently as 2007 2008 when I came on
 
02:46:57.410 --> 02:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
board we haven't done that since and so
 
02:46:59.630 --> 02:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
we had a curriculum staff which was able
 
02:47:02.270 --> 02:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
to help the school districts in
 
02:47:04.730 --> 02:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
identifying what the curriculum might
 
02:47:06.469 --> 02:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
look like and then we get there were
 
02:47:08.809 --> 02:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
guidelines that doesn't exist because we
 
02:47:10.250 --> 02:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
don't staff those positions
 
02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
representative also knows exactly what
 
02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about when he worked over
 
02:47:16.550 --> 02:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
there there was a larger staff when
 
02:47:18.950 --> 02:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with uh
 
02:47:22.429 --> 02:47:22.439 align:start position:0%
15 years ago but now it's changed so
 
02:47:24.590 --> 02:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're just kind of reacting
 
02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
and we need to get them out of that
 
02:47:29.270 --> 02:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
reacting mode into the acting and and
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative try
 
02:47:37.429 --> 02:47:37.439 align:start position:0%

the Department of Education this person
 
02:47:44.030 --> 02:47:44.040 align:start position:0%

02:47:45.830 --> 02:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
person that it would be in the
 
02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:48.540 align:start position:0%

cost of State adequate education and
 
03:53:10.190 --> 03:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
this bill would change the calculation
 
03:53:13.250 --> 03:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
for the per pupil amount for grants for
 
03:53:15.410 --> 03:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for an adequate
 
03:53:18.050 --> 03:53:18.060 align:start position:0%

03:53:21.229 --> 03:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
Statewide cost per pupil in consultation
 
03:53:22.849 --> 03:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
and discussion with the residents of

03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
doors like a lot of you did in this last
 
03:53:30.349 --> 03:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
election cycle it was strongly suggested
 
03:53:31.570 --> 03:53:31.580 align:start position:0%
that the financial
 
03:53:34.010 --> 03:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
sacrifices that were being made by the
 
03:53:36.050 --> 03:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
residents of Wilmette and Sutton to fund
 
03:53:38.510 --> 03:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
the public education of the Cure Sarge
 
03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%

from the state of New Hampshire through
 
03:53:52.729 --> 03:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
its legislature was skimpy
 
03:53:54.830 --> 03:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
question is why
 
03:53:57.469 --> 03:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
from Jamie Vollmer
 
03:54:00.650 --> 03:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
who stated that once upon a time the
 
03:54:03.410 --> 03:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
Mandate from society was simple let's
 
03:54:06.830 --> 03:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
teach our children not so anymore as a

03:54:13.610 --> 03:54:13.620 align:start position:0%
have cost
 
03:54:16.429 --> 03:54:16.439 align:start position:0%

the chart shows that social

what state adequacy looks like in the

towns of Hopkinton and Pittsfield
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
the state claimed that Hoppington could
 
03:57:53.030 --> 03:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
meet the adequate standards with three
 
03:57:54.590 --> 03:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
million seven hundred and seventy four
 
03:57:56.090 --> 03:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
thousand two hundred and fifty nine
 
03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
dollars versus the school budget of 20
 
03:58:00.349 --> 03:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
million plus
 
03:58:02.630 --> 03:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
and that Pittsfield could meet adequate
 
03:58:05.769 --> 03:58:05.779 align:start position:0%
standards with 2 690
 
03:58:09.889 --> 03:58:09.899 align:start position:0%
330 33 dollars versus a budget of 10
 
03:58:11.330 --> 03:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
million plus
 
03:58:14.450 --> 03:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
if these two districts re-budgeted their
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
school district budgets by eliminating
 
03:58:19.729 --> 03:58:19.739 align:start position:0%
items to meet the state adequacy Grant
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
funds they would violate New Hampshire
 
03:58:25.250 --> 03:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
State minimum standards and federal and
 
03:58:26.689 --> 03:58:26.699 align:start position:0%
state laws
 
03:58:29.870 --> 03:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
so the question arises is there a viable
 
03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
solution that the legislature through
 
03:58:35.929 --> 03:58:35.939 align:start position:0%
this education committee can use to
 
03:58:39.590 --> 03:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
comply with its exclusive obligation to
 
03:58:42.830 --> 03:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
Define and provide funding for an
 
03:58:44.929 --> 03:58:44.939 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
03:58:47.330 --> 03:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 334
 
03:58:50.389 --> 03:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
is that viable solution because it would
 
03:58:52.969 --> 03:58:52.979 align:start position:0%
provide a policy change in the state
 
03:58:56.030 --> 03:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
budgetary process of the unrestricted
 
03:58:59.689 --> 03:58:59.699 align:start position:0%
Revenue to the education trust fund from
 
03:59:02.150 --> 03:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
the general fund and provide a
 
03:59:05.150 --> 03:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
long-standing term solution
 
03:59:07.910 --> 03:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
the present policy of the cost of an
 
03:59:10.070 --> 03:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
using RSA 198 colon 40-a Roman numeral 2
 
03:59:17.150 --> 03:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
would be replaced by this bill's
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
language and use the suggested and I say
 
03:59:25.010 --> 03:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
suggested solution of one half of the
 
03:59:28.490 --> 03:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
Statewide average cost per pupil to
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
provide grants for the opportunity
 
03:59:33.410 --> 03:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education
 
03:59:35.929 --> 03:59:35.939 align:start position:0%
there are other legislators who sit on
 
03:59:37.729 --> 03:59:37.739 align:start position:0%
the other side of the aisle from me in
 
03:59:39.530 --> 03:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
03:59:41.990 --> 03:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
who are stressing that they will do
 
03:59:44.750 --> 03:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
everything they can to rectify the
 
03:59:48.170 --> 03:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
process that places so much tax burden
 
03:59:51.590 --> 03:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
on real estate making it difficult to
 
03:59:55.969 --> 03:59:55.979 align:start position:0%
induce people to move to or build in or
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
improve in a high tax Town thus tending
 
04:00:03.769 --> 04:00:03.779 align:start position:0%
to hold valuations down
 
04:00:06.290 --> 04:00:06.300 align:start position:0%
I have provided copies of this bill to

04:00:19.969 --> 04:00:19.979 align:start position:0%
that arose over and over again was where
 
04:00:22.370 --> 04:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
will the money come from in the state
 
04:00:25.189 --> 04:00:25.199 align:start position:0%

additional Revenue
 
04:00:48.530 --> 04:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's a house funding formula could be
 
04:00:53.150 --> 04:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
achieved if there exists a will
 
04:00:55.490 --> 04:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
the funding problem was created by
 
04:00:55.500 --> 04:00:57.650 align:start position:0%
the funding problem was created by
humans

04:00:57.650 --> 04:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
humans
 
04:00:59.450 --> 04:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
the funding problem was created by
 
04:01:02.090 --> 04:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
humans and if humans created it they can
 
04:01:03.889 --> 04:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
resolve it
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
visualize this when working together and
 
04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
I have a
 
04:01:11.330 --> 04:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
copies of a passive I'd like to
 
04:01:13.429 --> 04:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
give to someone that has
 
04:01:15.889 --> 04:01:15.899 align:start position:0%
oh you're so kind maybe if you split it
 
04:01:18.790 --> 04:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%

04:01:38.450 --> 04:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
visualize this when working together
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
hey 35
 
04:01:42.950 --> 04:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
000 pound Barn was moved without
 
04:01:42.960 --> 04:01:44.510 align:start position:0%
000 pound Barn was moved without
machinery

04:01:44.510 --> 04:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
machinery
 
04:01:47.389 --> 04:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
by humans working together
 
04:01:50.269 --> 04:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
and the article you can read the bottom
 
04:01:51.590 --> 04:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
lines there
 
04:01:54.110 --> 04:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
there were a thousand men there to do it
 
04:01:59.290 --> 04:01:59.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
while that's going around
 
04:02:06.359 --> 04:02:14.450 align:start position:0%
while that's going around
Jen

04:02:14.450 --> 04:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:16.130 --> 04:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
pass that
 
04:02:19.870 --> 04:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
well Jen passes this out
 
04:02:24.530 --> 04:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
the first chart that she's going to pass
 
04:02:25.729 --> 04:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
to you
 
04:02:29.269 --> 04:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
is the chart of ADM and cost per student
 
04:02:30.889 --> 04:02:30.899 align:start position:0%
based on the Department of Education
 
04:02:35.689 --> 04:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.210 --> 04:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
the second chart
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
is the cost in the previous years like
 
04:02:48.650 --> 04:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
2017 to 18 19 to 20 and then this past
 
04:02:49.969 --> 04:02:49.979 align:start position:0%
year of
 
04:02:49.979 --> 04:02:52.729 align:start position:0%
year of
21-22

04:02:52.729 --> 04:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
21-22
 
04:02:55.429 --> 04:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
and it shows each Town what would happen
 
04:02:57.650 --> 04:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
if we went to one half
 
04:02:59.570 --> 04:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
of the determination cost for an
 
04:03:03.530 --> 04:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
adequate education as I said I suggested
 
04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:13.550 --> 04:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:15.429 --> 04:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
here might as well hold on to this one
 
04:03:20.929 --> 04:03:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:22.490 --> 04:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
has it made it around yet to the Mr
 
04:03:22.500 --> 04:03:25.070 align:start position:0%
has it made it around yet to the Mr
chairman

04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.080 --> 04:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
anymore

04:03:27.640 --> 04:03:27.650 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
04:03:27.650 --> 04:03:29.929 align:start position:0%
anymore
[Laughter]

04:03:29.929 --> 04:03:29.939 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:03:31.610 --> 04:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Woodcock
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:46.189 --> 04:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
Jen would you pass out that half now
 
04:03:48.290 --> 04:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
put all these in play
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
this is a chart from the dra
 
04:03:51.000 --> 04:03:52.969 align:start position:0%
this is a chart from the dra
and

04:03:52.969 --> 04:03:52.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:55.070 --> 04:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
what we did is we took
 
04:03:57.550 --> 04:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
the 2021
 
04:04:00.889 --> 04:04:00.899 align:start position:0%
and set it at nine thousand dollars per
 
04:04:03.550 --> 04:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
pupil versus nine thousand two hundred
 
04:04:07.070 --> 04:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
and it was times 164
 
04:04:10.070 --> 04:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
000 students at the time
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
to fund an adequate education at one
 
04:04:14.090 --> 04:04:14.100 align:start position:0%
half the state costs and the blue sheet
 
04:04:15.590 --> 04:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's coming around presented by the
 
04:04:19.130 --> 04:04:19.140 align:start position:0%
dra I apologize for the having to strain
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
your eyes on that one they put the font
 
04:04:26.389 --> 04:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
at a a very small amount it shows 74
 
04:04:28.670 --> 04:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
percent of the general fund and Trust
 
04:04:31.309 --> 04:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
would have to be of the unrestricted
 
04:04:32.990 --> 04:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue would have to be
 
04:04:35.570 --> 04:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
used to meet the nine thousand that's
 
04:04:38.809 --> 04:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
why I said it's a suggested amount
 
04:04:41.389 --> 04:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
and that also means
 
04:04:44.450 --> 04:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
they took off the swept tax off that too
 
04:04:46.849 --> 04:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
now the sweatpant makes up about 18
 
04:04:46.859 --> 04:04:48.229 align:start position:0%
now the sweatpant makes up about 18
percent

04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:04:51.790 --> 04:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:54.530 --> 04:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
percentage so it'll be about 52 percent
 
04:04:56.510 --> 04:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
would be needed
 
04:04:58.490 --> 04:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
of the revenue if you don't do away with
 
04:05:01.610 --> 04:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
the swept tax now there is one caveat to
 
04:05:03.469 --> 04:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
think about when undertaking this move
 
04:05:07.330 --> 04:05:07.340 align:start position:0%
to increase the dollar amount of Grants
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
proposals to reduce Revenue
 
04:05:13.250 --> 04:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
by a house committee using percentage
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
rate reduction or elimination or sun
 
04:05:19.610 --> 04:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
setting of attacks from one of the
 
04:05:22.010 --> 04:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
present 15 tax groups that filled the
 
04:05:24.590 --> 04:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund revenue
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
is not feasible to achieve an increased
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
dollar amount per pupil and reduce the
 
04:05:35.809 --> 04:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
property tax burden from local taxpayers
 
04:05:38.330 --> 04:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
for citizens of New Hampshire
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
will not accept excuses of the State
 
04:05:40.680 --> 04:05:42.170 align:start position:0%
will not accept excuses of the State
Legislature

04:05:42.170 --> 04:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
Legislature
 
04:05:44.150 --> 04:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
who expressed that we don't have the
 
04:05:47.110 --> 04:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
revenue because it gave
 
04:05:50.330 --> 04:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
consistent percentage rate cuts
 
04:05:52.910 --> 04:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
on taxes or elimination of Revenue
 
04:05:55.429 --> 04:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
sources and neither will the judicial
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
system accept those types of excuses
 
04:06:01.729 --> 04:06:01.739 align:start position:0%
a meaningful response is needed now
 
04:06:04.490 --> 04:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
this education committee can be the
 
04:06:08.389 --> 04:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
leaders that conceive a solution to this
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
daunting Problem by creating a system of
 
04:06:14.510 --> 04:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
funding that removes a lot of the
 
04:06:16.250 --> 04:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
property tax burden
 
04:06:18.650 --> 04:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
from our local taxpayers
 
04:06:22.849 --> 04:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
in a letter dated April 2nd 2019 from
 
04:06:24.950 --> 04:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
the North Country superintendents to
 
04:06:27.410 --> 04:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
every state representative serving at
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
that time and some are still here today
 
04:06:33.469 --> 04:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
Express this about public education in
 
04:06:34.689 --> 04:06:34.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:06:37.849 --> 04:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
quality public education is the most
 
04:06:40.189 --> 04:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
important component of a free and
 
04:06:43.309 --> 04:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
Democratic Society our schools provide
 
04:06:45.349 --> 04:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
an essential pipeline
 
04:06:47.689 --> 04:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
for citizenship and Workforce
 
04:06:50.929 --> 04:06:50.939 align:start position:0%
Development our current path will soon
 
04:06:55.729 --> 04:06:55.739 align:start position:0%
lead us to economic peril in closing I
 
04:06:59.450 --> 04:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
ask I am poor this committee
 
04:07:02.750 --> 04:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
to find the will to respond either
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
through a subcommittee work or as a
 
04:07:07.250 --> 04:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole to this inequity
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
in funding by using this bill House Bill
 
04:07:10.560 --> 04:07:12.830 align:start position:0%
in funding by using this bill House Bill
334

04:07:12.830 --> 04:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
334
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
as a starting point to challenge
 
04:07:18.170 --> 04:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
legislative spending behaviors and
 
04:07:21.050 --> 04:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
change the tax burden that threatened to
 
04:07:24.290 --> 04:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
erode the quality that our residents and
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens expect from our
 
04:07:27.479 --> 04:07:28.729 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens expect from our
schools

04:07:28.729 --> 04:07:28.739 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:07:31.010 --> 04:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I do have uh
 
04:07:35.630 --> 04:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
copies for the Cork and for you sir and
 
04:07:38.030 --> 04:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
two extra ones right now thank you very
 
04:07:39.769 --> 04:07:39.779 align:start position:0%
much are there questions for the
 
04:07:42.170 --> 04:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
representative represent Belcher let me
 
04:07:44.689 --> 04:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
just thank you Mr chair I'd just like to
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
try to clarify uh this this new proposed
 
04:07:47.520 --> 04:07:49.309 align:start position:0%
try to clarify uh this this new proposed
formula

04:07:49.309 --> 04:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
formula
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
um so where it says here uh the cost for
 
04:07:55.130 --> 04:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
people in the admr shall be one half of
 
04:07:58.370 --> 04:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
the Statewide average cost per pupil but
 
04:08:01.250 --> 04:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
then it goes on to define the Statewide
 
04:08:04.250 --> 04:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
average cost per people meaning the
 
04:08:06.290 --> 04:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
combined State average of all school
 
04:08:08.689 --> 04:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
districts average cost per pupil for
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
total education expenses
 
04:08:12.889 --> 04:08:12.899 align:start position:0%
isn't that if I'm not mistaken not
 
04:08:14.809 --> 04:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
actually the average Statewide cost per
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
pupil but rather the average of the
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
districts because it's not waiting for
 
04:08:20.950 --> 04:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
their student populations
 
04:08:24.410 --> 04:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
what page were you on what line sir
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
so this is page two lines 13 through 17
 
04:08:35.150 --> 04:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:39.290 --> 04:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
this this chart was developed by the
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education they determine
 
04:08:43.490 --> 04:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
what the cost
 
04:08:45.110 --> 04:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
average cost
 
04:08:48.170 --> 04:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
per student would be
 
04:08:49.969 --> 04:08:49.979 align:start position:0%
throughout the state they take all the
 
04:08:54.429 --> 04:08:54.439 align:start position:0%
numbers of the adms divided by the uh
 
04:08:57.889 --> 04:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
amount total amount of all what the
 
04:09:00.290 --> 04:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
school each district spends and then
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
they come up with an average cost
 
04:09:07.729 --> 04:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
if I if I may Mr chair just to clarify
 
04:09:13.130 --> 04:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
then that yes it is in fact
 
04:09:17.809 --> 04:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
the average cost of all of the districts
 
04:09:20.389 --> 04:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
averages and not actually so it's not
 
04:09:22.490 --> 04:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
all of the students waited then is that
 
04:09:25.250 --> 04:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's the average cost that the district
 
04:09:25.260 --> 04:09:27.229 align:start position:0%
it's the average cost that the district
spends

04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
spends
 
04:09:28.729 --> 04:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
and they take the total number of
 
04:09:28.739 --> 04:09:30.710 align:start position:0%
and they take the total number of
students

04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:09:33.530 --> 04:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
they total the entire State that's what
 
04:09:35.689 --> 04:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to to stress here to get to
 
04:09:39.170 --> 04:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.090 --> 04:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you what are the questions
 
04:09:44.090 --> 04:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you very
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
much representative Schoenberg for um
 
04:09:48.650 --> 04:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward and uh and
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
also for uh for referencing the work of
 
04:09:53.689 --> 04:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
the commission I'll be referencing that
 
04:09:58.729 --> 04:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
uh later on as well but um but uh I I
 
04:10:02.030 --> 04:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
guess the you know question to you
 
04:10:04.790 --> 04:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
um and there'll be a follow-up on it as
 
04:10:08.269 --> 04:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
well but do you do you would you agree
 
04:10:08.279 --> 04:10:09.650 align:start position:0%
well but do you do you would you agree
that

04:10:09.650 --> 04:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:13.550 --> 04:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
um that not every school district and
 
04:10:15.710 --> 04:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
student population
 
04:10:18.830 --> 04:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know is identical from across the
 
04:10:18.840 --> 04:10:19.790 align:start position:0%
you know is identical from across the
state

04:10:19.790 --> 04:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:10:23.570 --> 04:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
um basically saying that that um that
 
04:10:26.090 --> 04:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
you know the Manchester school district
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
and the students that go there aren't
 
04:10:32.150 --> 04:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
exactly you know just larger population
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
but the same as the school district and
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
the students in Pittsfield and the
 
04:10:39.950 --> 04:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
students and School District in Concord
 
04:10:43.790 --> 04:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
I would agree all right so so follow up
 
04:10:45.469 --> 04:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
yeah and a follow-up thank you Mr chair
 
04:10:48.469 --> 04:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
so what your what you're proposing here
 
04:10:51.410 --> 04:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
is you know I'll use a somewhat of a
 
04:10:53.769 --> 04:10:53.779 align:start position:0%
pejorative term a one-size-fits-all
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
approach to to funding but um but what
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
would you do then you know if this were
 
04:11:02.210 --> 04:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
to go through
 
04:11:04.370 --> 04:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
um what would you do for um for the city
 
04:11:08.510 --> 04:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
of um of Berlin which currently has per
 
04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
student state grants a little over 11
 
04:11:14.090 --> 04:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
000 per student
 
04:11:14.100 --> 04:11:15.370 align:start position:0%
000 per student
foreign

04:11:15.370 --> 04:11:15.380 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
that is why I first said I suggested a
 
04:11:21.710 --> 04:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
percentage amount
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it up to this committee to
 
04:11:23.399 --> 04:11:24.530 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it up to this committee to
decide

04:11:24.530 --> 04:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
decide
 
04:11:28.010 --> 04:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
the policy portion of that
 
04:11:28.020 --> 04:11:29.410 align:start position:0%
the policy portion of that
but

04:11:29.410 --> 04:11:29.420 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:11:32.750 --> 04:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
when I read this
 
04:11:35.689 --> 04:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
our schools our students our schools our
 
04:11:35.699 --> 04:11:37.849 align:start position:0%
our schools our students our schools our
kids

04:11:37.849 --> 04:11:37.859 align:start position:0%
kids
 
04:11:42.250 --> 04:11:42.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
a Einstein I want to say to interpret
 
04:11:51.530 --> 04:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
all the things in here
 
04:11:53.769 --> 04:11:53.779 align:start position:0%
and when you give it to a
 
04:11:56.929 --> 04:11:56.939 align:start position:0%
resident to read
 
04:12:01.130 --> 04:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
they go what isn't there a simpler
 
04:12:01.140 --> 04:12:02.450 align:start position:0%
they go what isn't there a simpler
method

04:12:02.450 --> 04:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
method
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
to achieve funding
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
we do it in our homes
 
04:12:11.450 --> 04:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
you only have so much money coming in
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:18.110 --> 04:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
things that we'll pay for and then we
 
04:12:21.940 --> 04:12:21.950 align:start position:0%
pay for them it's a it's complicated
 
04:12:21.950 --> 04:12:23.710 align:start position:0%
pay for them it's a it's complicated
[Music]

04:12:23.710 --> 04:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:12:27.530 --> 04:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
as I said we've had almost 29 years to
 
04:12:30.650 --> 04:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
resolve some of these issues
 
04:12:33.050 --> 04:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
and we just keep adding on layer after
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
layer after layer of trying to resolve
 
04:12:38.030 --> 04:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
and balance it all out these school
 
04:12:41.330 --> 04:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
districts need money now the property
 
04:12:46.130 --> 04:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
owners need relief now it's a start it
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
is a start no and again and again thank
 
04:12:50.570 --> 04:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
you for bringing this forward Mr chair
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
also I apologize to you and and
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative I have to run to finance
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
for 115. and I certainly don't mean to
 
04:13:00.290 --> 04:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
run out on school funding um thank you
 
04:13:02.510 --> 04:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you well thanks representative
 
04:13:02.520 --> 04:13:03.710 align:start position:0%
thank you well thanks representative
cardelli

04:13:03.710 --> 04:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
cardelli
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:13:06.000 --> 04:13:07.790 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
representative

04:13:07.790 --> 04:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
um I believe you asked the question
 
04:13:13.250 --> 04:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
um where will the dollars come from in
 
04:13:16.130 --> 04:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
the state budget for this and I I wasn't
 
04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
sure if I heard an answer to the
 
04:13:22.929 --> 04:13:22.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:27.050 --> 04:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
presently the only way we can uh find
 
04:13:29.210 --> 04:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
these dollars is our tax system the way
 
04:13:31.790 --> 04:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's set up the money that is collected
 
04:13:34.130 --> 04:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
and put into the general fund
 
04:13:36.889 --> 04:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
on obligated monies is where we would
 
04:13:36.899 --> 04:13:37.790 align:start position:0%
on obligated monies is where we would
find

04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
find
 
04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
the money
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
for the students but it's going to take
 
04:13:45.710 --> 04:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a
 
04:13:48.170 --> 04:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
change in the operating budget and a
 
04:13:51.290 --> 04:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
change in our priorities a little bit
 
04:13:54.969 --> 04:13:54.979 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't spend as much on social
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
programs or we reduce the amount that is
 
04:14:03.410 --> 04:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
spent on social programs and search for
 
04:14:06.370 --> 04:14:06.380 align:start position:0%
other aspects from non-profits and and
 
04:14:08.889 --> 04:14:08.899 align:start position:0%
communities to come up with the money
 
04:14:11.229 --> 04:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up
 
04:14:15.610 --> 04:14:15.620 align:start position:0%
so um just so I make sure I understand
 
04:14:18.349 --> 04:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
the difference of seven hundred thousand
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
dollars plus
 
04:14:22.849 --> 04:14:22.859 align:start position:0%
um in this proposal would be taken from
 
04:14:25.969 --> 04:14:25.979 align:start position:0%
the general fund and a general fund
 
04:14:29.570 --> 04:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to other programs
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
Etc would be reduced to make up the
 
04:14:34.969 --> 04:14:34.979 align:start position:0%
difference in that appropriation is that
 
04:14:34.979 --> 04:14:36.650 align:start position:0%
difference in that appropriation is that
correct

04:14:36.650 --> 04:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you further questions
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
represent miler
 
04:14:44.269 --> 04:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:14:45.969 --> 04:14:45.979 align:start position:0%
taking my question I want to follow up
 
04:14:49.689 --> 04:14:49.699 align:start position:0%
on representative belcher's question
 
04:14:52.670 --> 04:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
when you start talking about a cost per
 
04:14:52.680 --> 04:14:53.750 align:start position:0%
when you start talking about a cost per
pupil

04:14:53.750 --> 04:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
04:14:58.189 --> 04:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
you made reference to the doe 25 form
 
04:15:01.689 --> 04:15:01.699 align:start position:0%
now the doe 25 form is an annual form
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
that is filed by each School District
 
04:15:06.950 --> 04:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
with the department and it covers all
 
04:15:10.689 --> 04:15:10.699 align:start position:0%
costs of a school district not just
 
04:15:13.729 --> 04:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
Personnel costs but it covers every
 
04:15:17.269 --> 04:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
possible cost so you're saying that you
 
04:15:20.530 --> 04:15:20.540 align:start position:0%
would like to have half of that cost
 
04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
averaged in the state
 
04:15:25.309 --> 04:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
that that would be reimbursed from the
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
state to the local school district is
 
04:15:28.610 --> 04:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
without changing the language of this
 
04:15:34.070 --> 04:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:36.889 --> 04:15:36.899 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli thank you
 
04:15:43.130 --> 04:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
am I correct in the reading that the
 
04:15:46.490 --> 04:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
charter school funding would be changed
 
04:15:49.370 --> 04:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
so that it would be uh equal to the
 
04:15:51.290 --> 04:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
appropriation for traditional Public
 
04:15:54.490 --> 04:15:54.500 align:start position:0%
Schools correct public Charters
 
04:15:59.030 --> 04:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes and one final question I was just
 
04:16:03.170 --> 04:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
wondering why the removal of
 
04:16:06.910 --> 04:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid for EFA students
 
04:16:10.370 --> 04:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
to simplify every school district has
 
04:16:12.590 --> 04:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
children that meet these qualifications
 
04:16:16.849 --> 04:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
of five thousand if you it's it's a
 
04:16:18.889 --> 04:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid of five thousand
 
04:16:20.929 --> 04:16:20.939 align:start position:0%
eighty seven dollars
 
04:16:25.010 --> 04:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
if every school district had that child
 
04:16:26.809 --> 04:16:26.819 align:start position:0%
it would be applied
 
04:16:28.790 --> 04:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
someone was going to say well
 
04:16:31.370 --> 04:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
we don't have third graders
 
04:16:33.650 --> 04:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
that fall into this so what can we do
 
04:16:35.630 --> 04:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
with the money
 
04:16:37.490 --> 04:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
I believe it's up to the school district
 
04:16:43.969 --> 04:16:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:46.610 --> 04:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
thank you I my mother told me Mr
 
04:16:48.830 --> 04:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
chairman if you don't know the rest of
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
them answered don't put your foot down
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
into something else all right
 
04:16:56.389 --> 04:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble understanding why
 
04:16:59.090 --> 04:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
you're using a doe 25 form which reports
 
04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
our assets our expenditures our revenues
 
04:17:04.729 --> 04:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
and on the expenditures it minuses out
 
04:17:06.349 --> 04:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
the transportation which you've
 
04:17:08.450 --> 04:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
mentioned and tuition which you've
 
04:17:08.460 --> 04:17:10.610 align:start position:0%
mentioned and tuition which you've
mentioned

04:17:10.610 --> 04:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:17:14.269 --> 04:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
the doe 25 form contains all its other
 
04:17:16.010 --> 04:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
expenditures including those
 
04:17:16.020 --> 04:17:17.630 align:start position:0%
expenditures including those
expenditures

04:17:17.630 --> 04:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
04:17:19.729 --> 04:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
which are
 
04:17:22.969 --> 04:17:22.979 align:start position:0%
decisions made by the local board that
 
04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
are not required by adequacy so then why
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
are you using the doe average of the
 
04:17:33.769 --> 04:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
from the 25 form when we're not talking
 
04:17:36.889 --> 04:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
about all the programs necessary for the
 
04:17:39.410 --> 04:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
delivery of inadequate education
 
04:17:42.170 --> 04:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
the present time the definition for
 
04:17:47.870 --> 04:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
adequacy has been established by past uh
 
04:17:50.450 --> 04:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
legislatures or past committees and
 
04:17:52.130 --> 04:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
passed by the legislature
 
04:17:55.189 --> 04:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
this is just a new approach to give the
 
04:17:58.030 --> 04:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
committee the opportunity to maybe
 
04:18:00.769 --> 04:18:00.779 align:start position:0%
change the policy
 
04:18:05.809 --> 04:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
of what adequacy is to maybe change the
 
04:18:05.819 --> 04:18:07.189 align:start position:0%
of what adequacy is to maybe change the
definition

04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
definition
 
04:18:10.429 --> 04:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
it may not include all those items that
 
04:18:12.769 --> 04:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
you are talking about but it would allow
 
04:18:14.689 --> 04:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
04:18:18.229 --> 04:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
can show the residents and the people of
 
04:18:19.490 --> 04:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
we can advance some of our definitions a
 
04:18:24.229 --> 04:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
little bit further than what they've
 
04:18:26.330 --> 04:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
been established
 
04:18:28.370 --> 04:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
are you aware as a follow-up question
 
04:18:31.130 --> 04:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
are you aware that the definition of
 
04:18:33.110 --> 04:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
adequacy is not in this section of law
 
04:18:35.330 --> 04:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
the definition of adequacy contained in
 
04:18:39.050 --> 04:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
193 e and there's no effort here to
 
04:18:39.060 --> 04:18:40.969 align:start position:0%
193 e and there's no effort here to
address

04:18:40.969 --> 04:18:40.979 align:start position:0%
address
 
04:18:42.650 --> 04:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
that change
 
04:18:45.229 --> 04:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
or a need to change as you're seeing it
 
04:18:48.889 --> 04:18:48.899 align:start position:0%
people when I drew this up
 
04:18:51.410 --> 04:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
it was before election time
 
04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're asking me but I
 
04:18:57.769 --> 04:18:57.779 align:start position:0%
was going to the central core
 
04:19:01.490 --> 04:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
of how we get to an adequate funding
 
04:19:03.410 --> 04:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
and it's money
 
04:19:03.420 --> 04:19:04.969 align:start position:0%
and it's money
and

04:19:04.969 --> 04:19:04.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:07.370 --> 04:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
it will always be money and I was hoping
 
04:19:10.490 --> 04:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman that maybe
 
04:19:12.410 --> 04:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
this committee like I said before would
 
04:19:14.630 --> 04:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
form a subcommittee and say well maybe
 
04:19:17.210 --> 04:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't go 50 maybe we should look
 
04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
back some other numbers use a different
 
04:19:22.849 --> 04:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
percentage 45 40. but make some change
 
04:19:25.610 --> 04:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
so that the people of New Hampshire the
 
04:19:28.130 --> 04:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
property owners the business owners who
 
04:19:30.769 --> 04:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
pay more in property taxes sometimes
 
04:19:32.929 --> 04:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
than they do on their business profits
 
04:19:32.939 --> 04:19:34.670 align:start position:0%
than they do on their business profits
tax

04:19:34.670 --> 04:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:19:37.070 --> 04:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
give them the idea that something is
 
04:19:39.229 --> 04:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
being done to address the situation
 
04:19:41.950 --> 04:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
because the court system is eventually
 
04:19:45.170 --> 04:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
going to make a decision
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
someday whether it's in April
 
04:19:49.969 --> 04:19:49.979 align:start position:0%
and they start hearing this Kentucky
 
04:19:52.490 --> 04:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
case or
 
04:19:54.830 --> 04:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
maybe next fall but if they make a
 
04:19:57.769 --> 04:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
decision and says you will the
 
04:20:01.309 --> 04:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
legislature of New Hampshire you will do
 
04:20:05.330 --> 04:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:07.729 --> 04:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
are we going to have the revenue but the
 
04:20:09.530 --> 04:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
biggest thing right now Mr chairman
 
04:20:12.530 --> 04:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
we heard two bills this morning we're
 
04:20:14.929 --> 04:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
hearing two more in ways and means right
 
04:20:14.939 --> 04:20:16.189 align:start position:0%
hearing two more in ways and means right
now

04:20:16.189 --> 04:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:20:19.370 --> 04:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to cut cut cut cut cut
 
04:20:19.380 --> 04:20:21.290 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to cut cut cut cut cut
rates

04:20:21.290 --> 04:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
rates
 
04:20:25.929 --> 04:20:25.939 align:start position:0%
cut programs cut taxes and
 
04:20:27.889 --> 04:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
 
04:20:40.010 --> 04:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you again Mr chairman I
 
04:20:41.150 --> 04:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
just want to follow up with my own
 
04:20:42.349 --> 04:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
question from earlier just to really
 
04:20:44.269 --> 04:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
make sure I have a good concrete
 
04:20:45.950 --> 04:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
understanding of the proposed formula so
 
04:20:47.990 --> 04:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
if you bear them with me for a sec if I
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
throw it a hypothetical if New Hampshire
 
04:20:51.769 --> 04:20:51.779 align:start position:0%
were to have only two school districts
 
04:20:54.050 --> 04:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
School District a has a single student
 
04:20:56.450 --> 04:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
who it costs on average to educate
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
ninety nine thousand dollars
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
and in the other District district B has
 
04:21:04.189 --> 04:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
a thousand students who cost one
 
04:21:06.530 --> 04:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars on average according to
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
this formula the average between those
 
04:21:10.010 --> 04:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
two districts then it's fifty thousand
 
04:21:12.650 --> 04:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
dollars per student and District B would
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed at fifty thousand dollars
 
04:21:16.969 --> 04:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
per student despite the fact that the
 
04:21:18.769 --> 04:21:18.779 align:start position:0%
cost of education for them is only one
 
04:21:21.229 --> 04:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
thousand is that
 
04:21:21.239 --> 04:21:24.130 align:start position:0%
thousand is that
accurate

04:21:24.130 --> 04:21:24.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:28.429 --> 04:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
now that's the only answer I have for
 
04:21:32.570 --> 04:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
you on that one okay thank you
 
04:21:34.550 --> 04:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
I think we're looking at the issue of
 
04:21:36.650 --> 04:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
Moulton Borough we're looking at
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
Waterville Valley 45 000 per kid we're
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
looking at Monroe we're looking at some
 
04:21:44.570 --> 04:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
of those towns which have the ability to
 
04:21:48.110 --> 04:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
raise those dollars easily and the
 
04:21:50.929 --> 04:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
others which are not there anywhere near
 
04:21:52.610 --> 04:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
it so then you're taking the average of
 
04:21:54.410 --> 04:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
these high and low you might even think
 
04:21:56.090 --> 04:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
about knocking out some of the high
 
04:21:57.469 --> 04:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
knocking out some of the low and
 
04:21:59.689 --> 04:21:59.699 align:start position:0%
figuring out then if you're going to go
 
04:22:01.550 --> 04:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
that but that's a different area of
 
04:22:01.560 --> 04:22:02.929 align:start position:0%
that but that's a different area of
mathematics

04:22:02.929 --> 04:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:13.010 --> 04:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:14.689 --> 04:22:14.699 align:start position:0%
ghost fan
 
04:22:17.929 --> 04:22:17.939 align:start position:0%
spend it on has determined at the school
 
04:22:22.130 --> 04:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
either School District town meeting or
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
at the deliberative session and then the
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
vote right and it varies very
 
04:22:30.830 --> 04:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
differently between schools what some
 
04:22:34.250 --> 04:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.110 --> 04:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
where you know
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh football field or the you know the
 
04:22:41.269 --> 04:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
things that aren't
 
04:22:43.370 --> 04:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
I won't say non-educational because you
 
04:22:45.469 --> 04:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
learn from everything right I'm just
 
04:22:48.050 --> 04:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
saying we have great differences
 
04:22:48.060 --> 04:22:49.550 align:start position:0%
saying we have great differences
and

04:22:49.550 --> 04:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:51.889 --> 04:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
I guess I have two
 
04:22:55.010 --> 04:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
questions one is is it appropriate then
 
04:22:56.630 --> 04:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
if the state
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
is giving more money to the school
 
04:23:01.910 --> 04:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
districts if they then take more control
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
over what the money is spent for
 
04:23:08.929 --> 04:23:08.939 align:start position:0%
because we have local control but by
 
04:23:11.929 --> 04:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
local control some districts will spend
 
04:23:14.150 --> 04:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
a lot more money I mean two districts
 
04:23:17.030 --> 04:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
that have the same amount
 
04:23:19.309 --> 04:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
some will spend a lot more money on
 
04:23:21.229 --> 04:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
Extras and some will spend a lot more
 
04:23:27.170 --> 04:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
money on on or a lot less money total
 
04:23:30.650 --> 04:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
and just I'm just saying so then if
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
you're paying half
 
04:23:34.969 --> 04:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
both of those are going in there
 
04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
that average and so should we then since
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
we're spending so much more have more
 
04:23:44.090 --> 04:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
say as to what it's spent for
 
04:23:46.429 --> 04:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
thus doing away with some of that local
 
04:23:49.670 --> 04:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
control a question by we do you mean the
 
04:23:49.680 --> 04:23:51.650 align:start position:0%
control a question by we do you mean the
legislature

04:23:51.650 --> 04:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:23:53.689 --> 04:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
yes well the people who are going to be
 
04:23:55.490 --> 04:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
yes the gov the government the
 
04:23:58.610 --> 04:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
legislature the doe whoever because
 
04:24:01.849 --> 04:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
we're providing more of the money
 
04:24:04.250 --> 04:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
I feel representative if the legislature
 
04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
puts down its of stipulations or rules
 
04:24:09.349 --> 04:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
in the beginning
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be a question on what
 
04:24:13.250 --> 04:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
local control does
 
04:24:16.849 --> 04:24:16.859 align:start position:0%
going back to your your your example
 
04:24:20.809 --> 04:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
High versus a Lower Split
 
04:24:24.290 --> 04:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
once the money is given to the
 
04:24:27.769 --> 04:24:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:30.769 --> 04:24:30.779 align:start position:0%
it allows just say five thousand dollars
 
04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
it allows the residents the
 
04:24:37.370 --> 04:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
the people that live in that school
 
04:24:40.370 --> 04:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
district to make a decision
 
04:24:43.370 --> 04:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
all right we would like to do this this
 
04:24:45.469 --> 04:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
this and this
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
and they then will have more resources
 
04:24:52.429 --> 04:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
because the state is paying a little bit
 
04:24:56.689 --> 04:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
more for them to reduce their tax load
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:25:00.290 --> 04:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
local residents can decide okay I'm
 
04:25:01.729 --> 04:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
going to support the football field I'm
 
04:25:03.110 --> 04:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
going to support drama
 
04:25:05.990 --> 04:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to support this this
 
04:25:09.349 --> 04:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
culinary action but it allows
 
04:25:11.929 --> 04:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
more money allows the locals to make
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
decisions of how they will spend the
 
04:25:16.610 --> 04:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
rest of their tax money
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
that the school district would like to
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
spend I think that's where local control
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
is I think the state should
 
04:25:25.969 --> 04:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
set the parameters
 
04:25:25.979 --> 04:25:27.769 align:start position:0%
set the parameters
and

04:25:27.769 --> 04:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:30.349 --> 04:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
and they should be so restrictive
 
04:25:34.370 --> 04:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
local control means local control not at
 
04:25:37.370 --> 04:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
the state house all the time
 
04:25:39.769 --> 04:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
follow up with that quickly
 
04:25:42.830 --> 04:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
so then the other the other
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
part of that is looking at
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
both historically and across States
 
04:25:52.560 --> 04:25:54.849 align:start position:0%
both historically and across States
um

04:25:54.849 --> 04:25:54.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:58.130 --> 04:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
what often happens if we give the extra
 
04:26:01.250 --> 04:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
nine thousand dollars next year the
 
04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
school will have nine thousand more
 
04:26:03.000 --> 04:26:04.070 align:start position:0%
school will have nine thousand more
dollars

04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:26:07.610 --> 04:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:11.210 --> 04:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
increase their taxes saying well we have
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
this more money coming from the state
 
04:26:15.649 --> 04:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
until their property taxes are the same
 
04:26:18.590 --> 04:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:19.990 --> 04:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
04:26:22.250 --> 04:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
wondering what I mean historically
 
04:26:24.590 --> 04:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's what I've seen do you anticipate
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
that happening well I don't think so
 
04:26:31.490 --> 04:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
that is my opinion in just my opinion I
 
04:26:33.290 --> 04:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
don't expect the school district to say
 
04:26:35.689 --> 04:26:35.699 align:start position:0%
okay we got this extra money let's keep
 
04:26:38.769 --> 04:26:38.779 align:start position:0%
our tax rate at the same no I think that
 
04:26:42.110 --> 04:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh the residents would say
 
04:26:44.649 --> 04:26:44.659 align:start position:0%
let's reduce our taxes
 
04:26:48.649 --> 04:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
let's move it down we
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's tough to answer that it really is
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
because you don't know what people are
 
04:26:53.279 --> 04:26:54.950 align:start position:0%
because you don't know what people are
thinking

04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
04:26:57.469 --> 04:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
I just know it's been done right thank
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
you very much I I got it I'm sure
 
04:27:01.250 --> 04:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up question for you have you done
 
04:27:03.349 --> 04:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet on this in terms of how
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
this is going to end this new formula
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
would uh I haven't looked at that so uh
 
04:27:09.950 --> 04:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
and the question being
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
how are we ever going to impact
 
04:27:14.269 --> 04:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
Implement something like this with the
 
04:27:17.149 --> 04:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
effective date you have on this bill
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
I believe that an amendment of this
 
04:27:24.950 --> 04:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh or maybe a change in the
 
04:27:27.229 --> 04:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
percentage could be amended by someone
 
04:27:31.250 --> 04:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
that is wanting to see an increase but
 
04:27:33.530 --> 04:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
maybe not as much as I have proposed by
 
04:27:35.210 --> 04:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
04:27:37.370 --> 04:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
I think that's for this education
 
04:27:41.210 --> 04:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
committee to decide I I just I put it
 
04:27:43.370 --> 04:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
out there as a
 
04:27:45.769 --> 04:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
as something that needs to be addressed
 
04:27:45.779 --> 04:27:46.670 align:start position:0%
as something that needs to be addressed
before

04:27:46.670 --> 04:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:27:49.610 --> 04:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
we are told what to do as a legislature
 
04:27:51.530 --> 04:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions from the
 
04:27:51.540 --> 04:27:52.610 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions from the
committee

committee
 
04:27:55.010 --> 04:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much
 
04:27:57.849 --> 04:27:57.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:28:01.010 --> 04:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I don't think we need it
 
04:28:22.550 --> 04:28:22.560 align:start position:0%

welcome

04:28:47.809 --> 04:28:47.819 align:start position:0%

04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Zach Sheehan
 
04:28:59.689 --> 04:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
I'm the Project Director of the New

Hampshire school funding and fairness
 
04:29:01.260 --> 04:29:03.170 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding and fairness
project

04:29:03.170 --> 04:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:29:04.969 --> 04:29:04.979 align:start position:0%
um I did bring written testimony but
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
have since marked it up and realized
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
number of uh edits so I'll bring some
 
04:29:09.830 --> 04:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
printed one after
 
04:29:11.870 --> 04:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
um for the committee
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
um for those who don't know the New
 
04:29:14.030 --> 04:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding Affairs project
 
04:29:16.130 --> 04:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
is a non-profit organization educates
 
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
citizens and policy makers about the
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
system New Hampshire uses to fund its
 
04:29:21.889 --> 04:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
Public Schools build awareness of those
 
04:29:26.450 --> 04:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
um I want to hit on a few points where I
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
brought up uh previously relative to the
 
04:29:31.550 --> 04:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
bill but first off I'll start by saying
 
04:29:34.070 --> 04:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
in general we are supportive of the
 
04:29:35.809 --> 04:29:35.819 align:start position:0%
concept of increasing the amount of
 
04:29:37.729 --> 04:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
funds that come from the state for
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
public education a number of the
 
04:29:41.870 --> 04:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
questions are raised by the committee we
 
04:29:43.370 --> 04:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
also have some concerns about but in
 
04:29:45.410 --> 04:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
general we are in favor of increasing
 
04:29:46.610 --> 04:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
the amount of money
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
um that the state sends to local
 
04:29:48.840 --> 04:29:50.510 align:start position:0%
um that the state sends to local
districts

04:29:50.510 --> 04:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:29:52.490 --> 04:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
um specifically because of that gap
 
04:29:55.910 --> 04:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
between the average cost of an adequate
 
04:29:57.170 --> 04:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
education as defined by the Department
 
04:29:58.729 --> 04:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
of Education and our current funding
 
04:29:58.739 --> 04:29:59.990 align:start position:0%
of Education and our current funding
formula

04:29:59.990 --> 04:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
formula
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
um resulting in only about 4 700 per
 
04:30:05.210 --> 04:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
student versus the average cost for
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
people being closer to nineteen thousand
 
04:30:09.950 --> 04:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
dollars per student and how do we reduce
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
that Gap to take some of the burden off
 
04:30:14.090 --> 04:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
of local property taxpayers which is
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:21.710 --> 04:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
and so in general uh we see House Bill
 
04:30:25.070 --> 04:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
334 as being an attempt to close that
 
04:30:25.080 --> 04:30:26.510 align:start position:0%
334 as being an attempt to close that
Gap

04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
Gap
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and for that reason we do support
 
04:30:30.830 --> 04:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
shifting some of that burden the tune
 
04:30:33.410 --> 04:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
the cost of taxpayers local taxpayers
 
04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
for public education is um as reported
 
04:30:37.910 --> 04:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
by the cushionist high school funding
 
04:30:40.250 --> 04:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
and other studies over two billion
 
04:30:43.130 --> 04:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
dollars per year that local property
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers pay for their public education
 
04:30:47.330 --> 04:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
system and we believe that is the
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
Constitutional obligation of the state
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
to fund more if not all of that however
 
04:30:53.809 --> 04:30:53.819 align:start position:0%
and this was something that was raised
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
by a number of committee members we do
 
04:30:59.210 --> 04:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
have concerns about uh wiping out the
 
04:31:02.210 --> 04:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
current adequacy formula for a kind of
 
04:31:04.490 --> 04:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
equality approach you know given a flat
 
04:31:06.889 --> 04:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
rate per students around the state you
 
04:31:08.269 --> 04:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
know the current Formula about we you
 
04:31:09.889 --> 04:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
know would have changes to propose to
 
04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
that and would like to increase the
 
04:31:12.050 --> 04:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
amount of funding that comes from the
 
04:31:14.030 --> 04:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
state does take into account different
 
04:31:16.969 --> 04:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
measures of need not every student needs
 
04:31:18.649 --> 04:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
the same resources not every school
 
04:31:21.050 --> 04:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
district needs to same resources and so
 
04:31:23.450 --> 04:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
we would you know want to keep that with
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
any changes moving forward so given that
 
04:31:28.309 --> 04:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
we've already kind of discussed this for
 
04:31:30.050 --> 04:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
quite a while I'll leave it there happy
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions committee
 
04:31:32.570 --> 04:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
members might have thank you very much
 
04:31:35.210 --> 04:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
04:31:37.309 --> 04:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
04:31:37.319 --> 04:31:40.429 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
you

04:31:40.429 --> 04:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:42.110 --> 04:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
now we do have technical support out
 
04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
there is anything Mark do you want to
 
04:31:46.130 --> 04:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
offer anything from the Department
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
or does anybody in the committee have
 
04:31:52.130 --> 04:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
technical type questions for for Mark
 
04:31:58.210 --> 04:31:58.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:01.790 --> 04:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
so you survived the previous studies
 
04:32:03.649 --> 04:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
which we've had on this commercial uh
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
the commission study Etc even within the
 
04:32:08.510 --> 04:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
commission study there was an amount set
 
04:32:10.610 --> 04:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
aside for differentiated Aid in special
 
04:32:13.010 --> 04:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
education four point now what was it now
 
04:32:16.250 --> 04:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
4.19 something like that times the the
 
04:32:19.309 --> 04:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
amount which was established for for per
 
04:32:19.319 --> 04:32:20.689 align:start position:0%
amount which was established for for per
pupil

04:32:20.689 --> 04:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
04:32:23.330 --> 04:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
um have you done anything are you how
 
04:32:26.090 --> 04:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
would that how would this approach
 
04:32:28.849 --> 04:32:28.859 align:start position:0%
impact all those categories of
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
differentiate English language learner
 
04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
special education
 
04:32:36.170 --> 04:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
free and reduced meals reading if
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
they're remedial not receiving the other
 
04:32:38.159 --> 04:32:38.990 align:start position:0%
they're remedial not receiving the other
three

04:32:38.990 --> 04:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:32:40.969 --> 04:32:40.979 align:start position:0%
Yep this approach for the record
 
04:32:42.889 --> 04:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
marketing and lo Department of Education
 
04:32:45.110 --> 04:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
School Finance administrator this
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
approach does get rid of differential
 
04:32:49.010 --> 04:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
Aid differential Aid does weight pupils
 
04:32:50.750 --> 04:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
differently as representative lad was
 
04:32:53.330 --> 04:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
discussing so it would take out that
 
04:32:55.010 --> 04:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
weight for special education and that
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
special education weight would not exist
 
04:32:58.429 --> 04:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
in the formula take out enough in that
 
04:33:00.530 --> 04:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
differential Aid F and R weight the
 
04:33:01.849 --> 04:33:01.859 align:start position:0%
English language learn to wait in the
 
04:33:03.769 --> 04:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
third grade reading weight but it also
 
04:33:06.410 --> 04:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
keep components of just uh it would keep
 
04:33:07.849 --> 04:33:07.859 align:start position:0%
relief Aid as part of the district
 
04:33:10.250 --> 04:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
formula and extraordinary needs grants
 
04:33:11.750 --> 04:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
so there would be some weighted
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
functioning but it wouldn't be as
 
04:33:17.810 --> 04:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
robust as the current formula as far as
 
04:33:19.670 --> 04:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
the weights are concerned um it would
 
04:33:21.590 --> 04:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
just be a flat that nine thousand uh
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
number and I have one last follow-up
 
04:33:26.269 --> 04:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
question how would this approach and the
 
04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
figures which you see right here impact
 
04:33:30.949 --> 04:33:30.959 align:start position:0%
catastrophic you know special education
 
04:33:30.959 --> 04:33:33.289 align:start position:0%
catastrophic you know special education
Aid

04:33:33.289 --> 04:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
Aid
 
04:33:36.789 --> 04:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
three and a half times up to
 
04:33:41.570 --> 04:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
80 100 percent uh a completely
 
04:33:44.750 --> 04:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
um making holding everything constant
 
04:33:46.490 --> 04:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
um this would have no impact the only
 
04:33:49.010 --> 04:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
time the only way it would impact on
 
04:33:51.289 --> 04:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
sped Aid is if districts received
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
additional funding and then they
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
increased their expenditures
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
um so if they received additional Aid
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
the 700 plus million dollars and then
 
04:34:02.449 --> 04:34:02.459 align:start position:0%
they use that all to basically supplant
 
04:34:04.369 --> 04:34:04.379 align:start position:0%
local tax dollars then that would have
 
04:34:05.929 --> 04:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
no impact on the cost per pupil
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
um but if they increase their
 
04:34:10.670 --> 04:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and increase their
 
04:34:12.949 --> 04:34:12.959 align:start position:0%
expenditures then it would increase the
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil which include impacts the
 
04:34:17.449 --> 04:34:17.459 align:start position:0%
sped Aid formula because the sped Aid
 
04:34:20.330 --> 04:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
formula triggers at 3.5 times the cost
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
per pupil so and that's way it would
 
04:34:25.010 --> 04:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
impact the sped Aid formula
 
04:34:26.689 --> 04:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
under those assumptions I guess I have
 
04:34:28.189 --> 04:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
one last one for you as you said all
 
04:34:30.470 --> 04:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
that the money that we have for base
 
04:34:32.810 --> 04:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
adequacy and differentiated is not
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
targeted money
 
04:34:35.869 --> 04:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
at this point time in other words this
 
04:34:37.609 --> 04:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't go to necessarily
 
04:34:40.490 --> 04:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
especially it might go for fixing a roof
 
04:34:44.769 --> 04:34:44.779 align:start position:0%
so yeah and taking this tax right here
 
04:34:48.051 --> 04:34:48.061 align:start position:0%
is all the funding within what we're
 
04:34:49.730 --> 04:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
seeing coming from the state where this
 
04:34:53.570 --> 04:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
you know one half the cost of the doe 25
 
04:34:58.189 --> 04:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
form is that all non-targeted money now
 
04:35:01.250 --> 04:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
so uh um good question I think there's a
 
04:35:03.289 --> 04:35:03.299 align:start position:0%
a difference in maybe jargon and when we
 
04:35:05.150 --> 04:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
use the word targeted versus when we use
 
04:35:07.131 --> 04:35:07.141 align:start position:0%
um how the money's used so targeted
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
typically when I use the word targeted
 
04:35:10.369 --> 04:35:10.379 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about
 
04:35:12.849 --> 04:35:12.859 align:start position:0%
is the a targeted for a particular
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
demographic but but you're getting to
 
04:35:16.369 --> 04:35:16.379 align:start position:0%
the next question is okay it's targeted
 
04:35:18.289 --> 04:35:18.299 align:start position:0%
for that demographic is it required to
 
04:35:20.269 --> 04:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
be spent on that demographic so our
 
04:35:22.490 --> 04:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
differential Aid components are targeted
 
04:35:24.650 --> 04:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
in a sense that we uh count a sped
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
student as reserving uh uh uh the school
 
04:35:29.810 --> 04:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
needs more aid for each sped student
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
they have so it is targeted in that
 
04:35:33.769 --> 04:35:33.779 align:start position:0%
regard but adequacy as it currently is
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
inadequacy under this legislation is
 
04:35:38.170 --> 04:35:38.180 align:start position:0%
always unrestricted so adequacy is never
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
mandated to be spent on a particular
 
04:35:42.289 --> 04:35:42.299 align:start position:0%
program it is always
 
04:35:44.390 --> 04:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
um the discretion of the local uh
 
04:35:46.010 --> 04:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
community that that answers it
 
04:35:48.590 --> 04:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli and thank you Mr
 
04:35:50.929 --> 04:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for being here
 
04:35:53.150 --> 04:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
um we've had some discussion about the
 
04:35:55.131 --> 04:35:55.141 align:start position:0%
Statewide average cost per pupil and the
 
04:35:58.189 --> 04:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
doe 25. could you touch on the
 
04:36:01.609 --> 04:36:01.619 align:start position:0%
components of the doe 25 and maybe
 
04:36:05.929 --> 04:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
specifically also what is included in
 
04:36:08.449 --> 04:36:08.459 align:start position:0%
terms of special education costs on the
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
doe 25 whether it's state and or local
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:16.750 --> 04:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
so the doe 25
 
04:36:18.890 --> 04:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
it's meant to show
 
04:36:21.230 --> 04:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
a full Financial yearly Financial
 
04:36:23.269 --> 04:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
picture of a district it does it's not a
 
04:36:25.070 --> 04:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
full um it's not as robust as a full
 
04:36:27.170 --> 04:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
audit it does not try to tally up all of
 
04:36:28.609 --> 04:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
their long-term assets but it's supposed
 
04:36:30.709 --> 04:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
to be a snapshot of their revenue
 
04:36:32.209 --> 04:36:32.219 align:start position:0%
expenditures for a full year and it's
 
04:36:35.029 --> 04:36:35.039 align:start position:0%
supposed to it is intended to capture
 
04:36:37.670 --> 04:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
all expenditures all revenue received
 
04:36:41.390 --> 04:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
there is some parsing out in some some
 
04:36:43.010 --> 04:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
account coding that gets us a little bit
 
04:36:46.150 --> 04:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
granular but is an um
 
04:36:48.830 --> 04:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
it does not it struggles to get to the
 
04:36:50.709 --> 04:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
granularity that some people would like
 
04:36:54.890 --> 04:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
for special education uh we do have it's
 
04:36:57.349 --> 04:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
called supplemental reporting we do have
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
some supplemental reporting where
 
04:37:01.070 --> 04:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
districts are required to parse out
 
04:37:03.650 --> 04:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
their specific special education costs
 
04:37:07.150 --> 04:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
on the doe 25 so we do
 
04:37:09.529 --> 04:37:09.539 align:start position:0%
capture that data
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
um the doe 25 is is not an audited
 
04:37:15.170 --> 04:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
um uh typically not an audited document
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
it is reviewed by the department is
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
submitted by the districts it is used in
 
04:37:21.410 --> 04:37:21.420 align:start position:0%

this committee about that question
 
04:37:30.769 --> 04:37:30.779 align:start position:0%
because it comes up a lot I think we
 
04:37:32.689 --> 04:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
spend about 750 million dollars
 
04:37:34.849 --> 04:37:34.859 align:start position:0%

Bowen Hopkinton
 
04:50:19.730 --> 04:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
um when the EFA program was introduced
 
04:50:22.430 --> 04:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
back in the fall of 2021 the
 
04:50:24.288 --> 04:50:24.298 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education and others
 
04:50:26.570 --> 04:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
presented the EFA program as an
 
04:50:28.670 --> 04:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for students who are not
 
04:50:31.250 --> 04:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
succeeding in their Public Schools
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
and to make a change
 
04:50:34.910 --> 04:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
to provide an alternative to their local
 
04:50:36.410 --> 04:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
public school
 
04:50:38.390 --> 04:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
of course we all know that that's not
 
04:50:40.550 --> 04:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
true other alternatives are readily
 
04:50:42.350 --> 04:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
available to all students and families
 
04:50:45.288 --> 04:50:45.298 align:start position:0%
such as charter schools and attendance
 
04:50:47.090 --> 04:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
at Public Schools outside of the
 
04:50:48.948 --> 04:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
resident's own District through the
 
04:50:51.288 --> 04:50:51.298 align:start position:0%
state's relatively new manifest
 
04:50:54.170 --> 04:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
education hardship law that we worked in
 
04:50:56.990 --> 04:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
this committee on so hard together in
 
04:51:00.250 --> 04:51:00.260 align:start position:0%
2019 collaboratively both Republicans
 
04:51:03.650 --> 04:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
Democrats and the stakeholders too
 
04:51:05.810 --> 04:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
but still the commissioner of education
 
04:51:08.690 --> 04:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
did make a case for Education Freedom
 
04:51:10.850 --> 04:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
accounts based on helping students who
 
04:51:12.948 --> 04:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
did not have the resources to leave
 
04:51:14.510 --> 04:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
their public school and choose an
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
alternative for their education needs
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
and a big point to make here to do it in
 
04:51:22.368 --> 04:51:22.378 align:start position:0%
a way that results in substantial
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
savings for the local property taxpayer
 
04:51:27.050 --> 04:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
since they wouldn't no longer be on the
 
04:51:29.750 --> 04:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
hook to pay the local costs to educate
 
04:51:31.970 --> 04:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
that student who leaves their Public
 
04:51:31.980 --> 04:51:33.530 align:start position:0%
that student who leaves their Public
School

04:51:33.530 --> 04:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
School
 
04:51:35.150 --> 04:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of examples from
 
04:51:37.250 --> 04:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
interviews news releases and media
 
04:51:39.530 --> 04:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
coverage and even the Department's own
 
04:51:41.930 --> 04:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
website and this from the website
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
quote this program has grown
 
04:51:43.798 --> 04:51:46.368 align:start position:0%
quote this program has grown
significantly

04:51:46.368 --> 04:51:46.378 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
04:51:48.410 --> 04:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
just a little feedback sorry this
 
04:51:50.628 --> 04:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
program has grown significantly in that
 
04:51:52.970 --> 04:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
faster Pace than other states that have
 
04:51:55.368 --> 04:51:55.378 align:start position:0%
adopted similar initiatives while it has
 
04:51:57.708 --> 04:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
exceeded our expectation it is exciting
 
04:51:59.090 --> 04:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
and encouraging to know that New
 
04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families now have the
 
04:52:02.570 --> 04:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
opportunity to determine the best
 
04:52:04.430 --> 04:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
educational Pathways for their children
 
04:52:06.890 --> 04:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
and that economically disadvantaged
 
04:52:09.590 --> 04:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
students will also have various options
 
04:52:13.310 --> 04:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
to fit their personal learning needs and
 
04:52:15.050 --> 04:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
that's quoted directly from a
 
04:52:17.448 --> 04:52:17.458 align:start position:0%

edelbrook edelblue
 
04:52:22.850 --> 04:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
a recent uh Department news release also
 
04:52:25.128 --> 04:52:25.138 align:start position:0%
States quote education Freedom accounts
 
04:52:27.470 --> 04:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
allow eligible New Hampshire students to
 
04:52:29.390 --> 04:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
direct state-funded per-pupil education
 
04:52:31.610 --> 04:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
adequacy grants towards select
 
04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
educational programming of their choice
 
04:52:36.010 --> 04:52:36.020 align:start position:0%
for a variety of learning experiences
 
04:52:39.170 --> 04:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
there are currently 3025 students
 
04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the EFA program that is
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
offering grants totally nearly 14.7
 
04:52:46.730 --> 04:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
million dollars this school year that's
 
04:52:49.550 --> 04:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
all part of the commissioner's quote
 
04:52:51.590 --> 04:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
um the cost to taxpayers would be about
 
04:52:55.730 --> 04:52:55.740 align:start position:0%
65 million dollars if the 3025 students
 
04:52:58.730 --> 04:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
who are all eligible attended a
 
04:53:01.310 --> 04:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
traditional public school that's all in
 
04:53:04.368 --> 04:53:04.378 align:start position:0%
the the Department's news release
 
04:53:06.890 --> 04:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
in a December 2020 interview with the
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
Josiah Bartlett Center Governor Chris
 
04:53:11.810 --> 04:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
sununu went on to say quote it's going
 
04:53:14.810 --> 04:53:14.820 align:start position:0%
to have huge impacts on property taxes
 
04:53:17.930 --> 04:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
huge impacts on on just the individual
 
04:53:20.448 --> 04:53:20.458 align:start position:0%
tax base of the state not quite sure
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
what he meant by the last part but I'll
 
04:53:26.330 --> 04:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
I'll take him at his word that that he
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
expected the uh the education Freedom
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
count to have huge impacts on to reduce
 
04:53:34.430 --> 04:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
04:53:35.990 --> 04:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
but according to the Department of
 
04:53:40.128 --> 04:53:40.138 align:start position:0%
Education about 400 of the newest 1453
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
EFA students and this is also in a quote
 
04:53:46.970 --> 04:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
from from Department news relief only
 
04:53:50.330 --> 04:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
only 400 of the newest 1453 fa students
 
04:53:52.010 --> 04:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
for this year switched from a public
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
school to an education Freedom account
 
04:53:56.510 --> 04:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
program about 27 percent
 
04:53:59.150 --> 04:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
and according to the department EFA fact
 
04:54:02.750 --> 04:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
sheet from November 2021 there were only
 
04:54:07.670 --> 04:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
280 students out of the 1635 who left
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
their public school and took a voucher
 
04:54:10.670 --> 04:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
for the first year of the program only
 
04:54:13.070 --> 04:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
280 of those students actually left
 
04:54:14.890 --> 04:54:14.900 align:start position:0%
their Public School
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
so if we add this up
 
04:54:20.390 --> 04:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
today only about 680 of the
 
04:54:22.910 --> 04:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 3 200 EFA students
 
04:54:25.250 --> 04:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
attended a public school during the year
 
04:54:27.770 --> 04:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
prior to joining the program the other
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
students were not attending public
 
04:54:31.970 --> 04:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
school maybe there were private schools
 
04:54:34.368 --> 04:54:34.378 align:start position:0%
or maybe they were at home schools but
 
04:54:35.990 --> 04:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
in any event they weren't costing
 
04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers 65 million dollars in fact
 
04:54:41.208 --> 04:54:41.218 align:start position:0%
they were costing taxpayers nothing
 
04:54:42.650 --> 04:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
say that again
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
based on the Department's own numbers
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
nearly 80 percent of the EFA students
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
were already were not in public schools
 
04:54:54.650 --> 04:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
and not costing taxpayers a dime
 
04:54:56.448 --> 04:54:56.458 align:start position:0%
but since the program was enacted as
 
04:55:00.410 --> 04:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
part of the 2020-23 state budget the EFA
 
04:55:02.750 --> 04:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
program has cost taxpayers more than 23
 
04:55:04.730 --> 04:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
million dollars and the commissioner of
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
education has requested an additional 60
 
04:55:09.230 --> 04:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the next two years
 
04:55:11.090 --> 04:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
of this program
 
04:55:14.750 --> 04:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 430 clears this up saves
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers millions of dollars and make
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
sure the EFA program doesn't turn into a
 
04:55:20.990 --> 04:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded private school tuition
 
04:55:21.000 --> 04:55:23.270 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded private school tuition
program

04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:55:26.270 --> 04:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
the bill simply requires students to be
 
04:55:28.250 --> 04:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
enrolled in their public school when
 
04:55:31.610 --> 04:55:31.620 align:start position:0%
they apply for an EFA exception is made
 
04:55:32.750 --> 04:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
for students who are entering
 
04:55:35.448 --> 04:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
kindergarten or first grade it's
 
04:55:37.788 --> 04:55:37.798 align:start position:0%
straight out of the amendment out of an
 
04:55:42.350 --> 04:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
amendment to Senate Bill 193 from 2018.
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's actually for the record amendment
 
04:55:48.050 --> 04:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
number 2530h that was sponsored by reps
 
04:55:49.970 --> 04:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
lad and cordelli
 
04:55:52.910 --> 04:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
the Bill's fiscal note says quote this
 
04:55:55.250 --> 04:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
bill will result in an indeterminable
 
04:55:57.288 --> 04:55:57.298 align:start position:0%
number of students falling out of the
 
04:55:57.298 --> 04:55:58.910 align:start position:0%
number of students falling out of the
program

04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:56:00.410 --> 04:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know what they mean by that or
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
where that comes from this is nonsense
 
04:56:05.208 --> 04:56:05.218 align:start position:0%
and it's blatantly incorrect
 
04:56:07.970 --> 04:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
Hospital 430 has no impact on students
 
04:56:10.850 --> 04:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
already in the EFA program it simply
 
04:56:15.288 --> 04:56:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:16.610 --> 04:56:16.620 align:start position:0%
we're committed to improving the
 
04:56:18.170 --> 04:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
accountability oversight and
 
04:56:20.750 --> 04:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
transparency of the EFA program would
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
the commissioner now asking for 60
 
04:56:24.170 --> 04:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
million dollars of taxpayer money in the
 
04:56:25.670 --> 04:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
next budget for it
 
04:56:27.770 --> 04:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's more important than ever that
 
04:56:29.690 --> 04:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
taxpayers know how their money is being
 
04:56:32.868 --> 04:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
spent and the results thank you Mr chair
 
04:56:34.850 --> 04:56:34.860 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and be happy to
 
04:56:36.288 --> 04:56:36.298 align:start position:0%
take some questions thank you very much
 
04:56:37.730 --> 04:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
representative Luna are there questions
 
04:56:40.570 --> 04:56:40.580 align:start position:0%
for the representative
 
04:56:43.368 --> 04:56:43.378 align:start position:0%
yes represent like this
 
04:56:46.010 --> 04:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:56:46.020 --> 04:56:47.690 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

04:56:47.690 --> 04:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I've seen things like this put into
 
04:56:54.948 --> 04:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
place in other states and what they
 
04:56:57.288 --> 04:56:57.298 align:start position:0%
experienced was a whole lot of people
 
04:56:59.330 --> 04:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
suddenly registering for public school
 
04:57:02.208 --> 04:57:02.218 align:start position:0%
for one year and I'm wondering do you
 
04:57:06.530 --> 04:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:06.540 --> 04:57:07.788 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:57:07.788 --> 04:57:07.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:09.530 --> 04:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for the question
 
04:57:12.110 --> 04:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand the scenario
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
if they're already in the EFA program
 
04:57:16.430 --> 04:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go back to public
 
04:57:19.810 --> 04:57:19.820 align:start position:0%
school for a year to remain it to
 
04:57:23.330 --> 04:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
reapply back into the the EFA program
 
04:57:23.340 --> 04:57:25.128 align:start position:0%
reapply back into the the EFA program
for

04:57:25.128 --> 04:57:25.138 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:57:29.448 --> 04:57:29.458 align:start position:0%
um for um for other students they would
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
you're right have to be in public
 
04:57:34.490 --> 04:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
schools which is the entire premise that
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
one of the key premises that that the
 
04:57:39.230 --> 04:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
program was uh was founded on by the
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education and um and uh
 
04:57:44.990 --> 04:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh except if they're going into
 
04:57:46.730 --> 04:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
kindergarten or first grade they could
 
04:57:48.708 --> 04:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
apply directly without having to attend
 
04:57:50.510 --> 04:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
a public school but if they're in third
 
04:57:54.170 --> 04:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
second grade or or later all they need
 
04:57:57.770 --> 04:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
to do is apply and um and uh go through
 
04:57:59.208 --> 04:57:59.218 align:start position:0%
the application process with the
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund
 
04:58:03.530 --> 04:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher yeah your hand up
 
04:58:06.410 --> 04:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:58:08.208 --> 04:58:08.218 align:start position:0%
um oh I certainly share the the
 
04:58:10.010 --> 04:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
understanding that we have at all times
 
04:58:13.250 --> 04:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
must balance the taxation versus our
 
04:58:15.110 --> 04:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
need to educate
 
04:58:15.120 --> 04:58:16.430 align:start position:0%
need to educate
um children

04:58:16.430 --> 04:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
um children
 
04:58:18.590 --> 04:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
um but can you speak to the
 
04:58:20.330 --> 04:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
um the ethics surrounding the Supreme
 
04:58:23.030 --> 04:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
Court case on adequacy funding as it
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
would relate to
 
04:58:27.530 --> 04:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
seemingly arbitrarily prohibiting
 
04:58:29.690 --> 04:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
certain students from accessing efas if
 
04:58:31.250 --> 04:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
they don't complete or if they haven't
 
04:58:33.288 --> 04:58:33.298 align:start position:0%
been in school for a year is is that a
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
is that a conflict what Supreme Court
 
04:58:37.250 --> 04:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
court case are you referencing that
 
04:58:38.750 --> 04:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
required us to come up with the adequacy
 
04:58:41.090 --> 04:58:41.100 align:start position:0%
funding so so you're talking about the
 
04:58:43.788 --> 04:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court yes uh in the in
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
I would say in Con in Clermont and
 
04:58:49.550 --> 04:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
Claremont 2 in Londonderry yes and so
 
04:58:52.670 --> 04:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
um it uh Mr chair we could probably have
 
04:58:55.670 --> 04:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
an entire weekend on this uh this issue
 
04:58:57.850 --> 04:58:57.860 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to get too deep into
 
04:59:01.730 --> 04:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
Londonderry so yeah yeah so so uh we'll
 
04:59:04.490 --> 04:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'll um I'll I'll sort of short circuit
 
04:59:07.788 --> 04:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
of a full you know discussion uh on that
 
04:59:09.948 --> 04:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
but uh but the state does have a
 
04:59:11.868 --> 04:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to cherish an
 
04:59:14.030 --> 04:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
education for all of its children I'm
 
04:59:15.530 --> 04:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
not sure if that's CL I think it's close
 
04:59:18.170 --> 04:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
to the wording in the Constitution but
 
04:59:21.410 --> 04:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
um but um uh the state exercises that
 
04:59:23.390 --> 04:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility and that constitutional
 
04:59:25.610 --> 04:59:25.620 align:start position:0%
obligation through a series of public
 
04:59:28.070 --> 04:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
schools throughout the state I'm sorry
 
04:59:29.690 --> 04:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
let me make it clear through public
 
04:59:32.150 --> 04:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
school districts uh throughout the state
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
and it has a constitutional obligation
 
04:59:37.910 --> 04:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
to fund an adequate education uh for
 
04:59:40.550 --> 04:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
those for those public school districts
 
04:59:42.288 --> 04:59:42.298 align:start position:0%
and I think all of that came out of
 
04:59:45.170 --> 04:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
Clermont on Claremont 2 and one Dairy um
 
04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh touched on that on that as well
 
04:59:51.708 --> 04:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
um the state the legislature and by that
 
04:59:55.128 --> 04:59:55.138 align:start position:0%
I'll say the state has has waded into
 
04:59:58.550 --> 04:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
other areas over the last decade or more
 
05:00:01.368 --> 05:00:01.378 align:start position:0%
including charter schools and now the
 
05:00:03.890 --> 05:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
EFA program neither of which the state
 
05:00:06.770 --> 05:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
has a constitutional obligation to
 
05:00:09.430 --> 05:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
provide for its children or to fund
 
05:00:13.610 --> 05:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
because the existing platform foundation
 
05:00:16.788 --> 05:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
for public school districts provides
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
that constitutionally required
 
05:00:18.480 --> 05:00:21.470 align:start position:0%
that constitutionally required
obligation

05:00:21.470 --> 05:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:23.150 --> 05:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher do you have a
 
05:00:24.650 --> 05:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
follow-up to your question yes please if
 
05:00:26.090 --> 05:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
that's that's all right
 
05:00:27.830 --> 05:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
um to switch gears to a different core
 
05:00:29.570 --> 05:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
for a moment to the Supreme Court who
 
05:00:32.090 --> 05:00:32.100 align:start position:0%
fairly recently struck down the concept
 
05:00:34.610 --> 05:00:34.620 align:start position:0%
of the Blaine Amendment saying that if
 
05:00:36.530 --> 05:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
you're if the state is going to fund any
 
05:00:38.810 --> 05:00:38.820 align:start position:0%
sort of religious education then they
 
05:00:40.910 --> 05:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
cannot discriminate
 
05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
um how does that you think impact the
 
05:00:46.150 --> 05:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
idea that we're going to arbitrarily say
 
05:00:48.470 --> 05:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
some students who haven't gone to public
 
05:00:50.448 --> 05:00:50.458 align:start position:0%
school cannot participate in efas where
 
05:00:53.510 --> 05:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
other students currently are receiving
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
that education yeah I I think you're
 
05:00:58.970 --> 05:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
you're sort of you know mixing metaphors
 
05:01:01.270 --> 05:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
on on this case
 
05:01:04.550 --> 05:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
I don't believe the the Supreme Court's
 
05:01:08.270 --> 05:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
ruling in that is directed to what uh
 
05:01:11.448 --> 05:01:11.458 align:start position:0%
what this is saying which is uh which is
 
05:01:15.050 --> 05:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
um you know parameters uh for uh for a
 
05:01:16.970 --> 05:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
student's family or for a student to
 
05:01:19.070 --> 05:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
receive money from the state as long as
 
05:01:22.010 --> 05:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
they meet certain certain criteria none
 
05:01:25.730 --> 05:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
of it says makes any determination on on
 
05:01:30.050 --> 05:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
on whether or not they are going to or
 
05:01:32.208 --> 05:01:32.218 align:start position:0%
would like to go to a religious school
 
05:01:36.770 --> 05:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
or a um or a non-religious
 
05:01:38.750 --> 05:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
um school it just basically sets
 
05:01:41.750 --> 05:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
criteria saying student has to be within
 
05:01:41.760 --> 05:01:42.850 align:start position:0%
criteria saying student has to be within
this

05:01:42.850 --> 05:01:42.860 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:01:46.910 --> 05:01:46.920 align:start position:0%

05:02:09.530 --> 05:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
um so basically with this um legislation
 
05:02:12.770 --> 05:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
we're interpreting the Constitution to
 
05:02:15.288 --> 05:02:15.298 align:start position:0%
say that we should cherish uh the
 
05:02:17.330 --> 05:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
education of a student if they are
 
05:02:19.010 --> 05:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
attending a public school
 
05:02:21.770 --> 05:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
is is that correct no that's that's not
 
05:02:25.070 --> 05:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
what I said what I what I what I said
 
05:02:26.810 --> 05:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
was the state
 
05:02:29.208 --> 05:02:29.218 align:start position:0%
um has an obligation to cherish
 
05:02:32.570 --> 05:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
education for all of its children and it
 
05:02:36.830 --> 05:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
meets that obligation through a a a a a
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
a platform of public school districts
 
05:02:42.230 --> 05:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
which it funds
 
05:02:44.990 --> 05:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
um um which it funds through adequacy
 
05:02:47.030 --> 05:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
all across the state
 
05:02:47.040 --> 05:02:49.010 align:start position:0%
all across the state
yes

05:02:49.010 --> 05:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:02:51.350 --> 05:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not taking away any private
 
05:02:51.360 --> 05:02:52.788 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not taking away any private
options

05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
options
 
05:02:55.190 --> 05:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
um uh for people people can can make
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
their own educational choices outside of
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
that but at a minimum it has to provide
 
05:03:03.110 --> 05:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
um an opportunity for an adequate
 
05:03:05.090 --> 05:03:05.100 align:start position:0%
education which it does so through uh
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
through public school districts
 
05:03:07.200 --> 05:03:08.390 align:start position:0%
through public school districts
so

05:03:08.390 --> 05:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:08.400 --> 05:03:10.010 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:03:10.010 --> 05:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:14.510 --> 05:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
the education of a child who is not
 
05:03:17.208 --> 05:03:17.218 align:start position:0%
attending a public school
 
05:03:19.368 --> 05:03:19.378 align:start position:0%
um is not
 
05:03:21.590 --> 05:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
um covered in the Constitution it's it's
 
05:03:23.628 --> 05:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
not part of
 
05:03:26.690 --> 05:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
um a part two article 83 no no of course
 
05:03:28.670 --> 05:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's covered in the Constitution and
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
that child could receive that that
 
05:03:33.410 --> 05:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
education through through going to their
 
05:03:35.810 --> 05:03:35.820 align:start position:0%
Public Schools provided they live in the
 
05:03:37.368 --> 05:03:37.378 align:start position:0%
um the state of New Hampshire you know
 
05:03:40.250 --> 05:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
and qualify as as the state you know the
 
05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
the children who live in the in in the
 
05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
05:03:48.430 --> 05:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm not aware of very many
 
05:03:52.670 --> 05:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy I I I'm not aware that the
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
state's definition of constitutional
 
05:03:58.368 --> 05:03:58.378 align:start position:0%
adequacy even provide even applies
 
05:04:01.190 --> 05:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
outside of the uh the realm of public
 
05:04:01.200 --> 05:04:03.190 align:start position:0%
outside of the uh the realm of public
schools

05:04:03.190 --> 05:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:04:06.530 --> 05:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
one last question yes
 
05:04:10.550 --> 05:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
um but for any child whose education we
 
05:04:10.560 --> 05:04:11.690 align:start position:0%
um but for any child whose education we
cherish

cherish
 
05:04:15.948 --> 05:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
does not fit into their local public
 
05:04:15.958 --> 05:04:17.050 align:start position:0%
does not fit into their local public
school

05:04:17.050 --> 05:04:17.060 align:start position:0%

based on their education
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
needs and their learning styles then
 
05:04:26.708 --> 05:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
um then they fall out of our
 
05:04:29.510 --> 05:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement for that
 
05:04:32.090 --> 05:04:32.100 align:start position:0%

05:04:40.490 --> 05:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education if
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
that if the student or their family
 
05:04:44.448 --> 05:04:44.458 align:start position:0%

here and part of that process at the
 
05:05:20.150 --> 05:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
time the
 
05:05:20.160 --> 05:05:22.010 align:start position:0%

part of the process he was on education
 
05:05:30.110 --> 05:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
and part of the process of coming up
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
with that formula and what he was
 
05:05:35.750 --> 05:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
explaining to me was that
 
05:05:39.050 --> 05:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
speaking about every they were dividing
 
05:05:41.150 --> 05:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
it by District but it didn't mean the
 
05:05:43.610 --> 05:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
students in the school
 
05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
system districts but all students
 
05:05:49.788 --> 05:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
all students who lived within that
 
05:05:49.798 --> 05:05:50.868 align:start position:0%
all students who lived within that
District

05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
District
 
05:05:52.850 --> 05:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
was the number they were talking about
 
05:05:55.250 --> 05:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
and they didn't Envision that it would
 
05:05:57.288 --> 05:05:57.298 align:start position:0%
only be going to public school students
 
05:05:59.690 --> 05:05:59.700 align:start position:0%

also a co-sponsor of it so I am
 
05:07:13.850 --> 05:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
representative Karine cascadden I
 
05:07:16.190 --> 05:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
represent kowas County District 5 the

city of Berlin
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
um this is just more additional
 
05:07:22.010 --> 05:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
information that people need to know
 
05:07:24.050 --> 05:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
because unless you actually work in a
 
05:07:25.788 --> 05:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
district or a system
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
you really don't know what
 
05:07:30.650 --> 05:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
responsibilities lie within that whole
 
05:07:32.990 --> 05:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
school district not just the buildings
 
05:07:33.000 --> 05:07:34.730 align:start position:0%
school district not just the buildings
themselves

05:07:34.730 --> 05:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:07:37.550 --> 05:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
and as a superintendent you are required
 
05:07:41.330 --> 05:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
by federal laws to make sure that if
 
05:07:43.788 --> 05:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
there are students that need Services of
 
05:07:45.890 --> 05:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
any kind whether they are homeschooled
 
05:07:48.350 --> 05:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
or in private schools that there is a
 
05:07:48.360 --> 05:07:49.730 align:start position:0%
or in private schools that there is a
relationship

05:07:49.730 --> 05:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
05:07:51.770 --> 05:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
and I've had some very successful
 
05:07:54.890 --> 05:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
parents who homeschool and they have
 
05:07:57.288 --> 05:07:57.298 align:start position:0%
access to our programs at their choice
 
05:07:59.208 --> 05:07:59.218 align:start position:0%
and need
 
05:08:01.550 --> 05:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
um so I want to say that public schools
 
05:08:03.530 --> 05:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
at the administrative level of a
 
05:08:06.050 --> 05:08:06.060 align:start position:0%

05:08:08.810 --> 05:08:08.820 align:start position:0%

05:08:23.030 --> 05:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
co-curricular athletic programs at no
 
05:08:23.040 --> 05:08:25.010 align:start position:0%
co-curricular athletic programs at no
cost

05:08:25.010 --> 05:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
um and at whatever parts or levels as
 
05:08:30.050 --> 05:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
long as it is less than 50 percent of a
 
05:08:32.650 --> 05:08:32.660 align:start position:0%
day because if they take one class over
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
you know that fifty percent then they
 
05:08:36.770 --> 05:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
need to enroll as a student but they can
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
take up to say four courses a year and
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
earn high school credit
 
05:08:44.570 --> 05:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
um at no additional
 
05:08:44.580 --> 05:08:45.410 align:start position:0%
um at no additional
um

05:08:45.410 --> 05:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:47.690 --> 05:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
you know at no cost because it's already
 
05:08:49.490 --> 05:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
05:08:51.830 --> 05:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
and again this is partly paid by
 
05:08:55.010 --> 05:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
property local property taxpayers my
 
05:08:57.410 --> 05:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
concern is to watch out though
 
05:09:00.530 --> 05:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
if someone wants some of these services
 
05:09:03.410 --> 05:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
and is on a scholarship
 
05:09:06.410 --> 05:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
but don't want those opportunities in
 
05:09:08.690 --> 05:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
the public sector isn't that double
 
05:09:08.700 --> 05:09:09.970 align:start position:0%
the public sector isn't that double
dipping

05:09:09.970 --> 05:09:09.980 align:start position:0%
dipping
 
05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
my next is on special ed services and
 
05:09:15.230 --> 05:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
again there are multiple federal laws
 
05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
from referral through process through
 
05:09:21.470 --> 05:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
identification of all children that are
 
05:09:23.930 --> 05:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
in need within the district it doesn't
 
05:09:25.610 --> 05:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
matter if they're a homeschool student
 
05:09:28.730 --> 05:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
if that parent suspects there's an issue
 
05:09:30.948 --> 05:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
then their contact is that Local
 
05:09:33.890 --> 05:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
District to see can you help me figure
 
05:09:35.868 --> 05:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
this child out and what do I need to
 
05:09:38.750 --> 05:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
provide or what do you need to provide
 
05:09:43.010 --> 05:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
and so if a student or a parent
 
05:09:45.230 --> 05:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
has a child already in a public school
 
05:09:47.750 --> 05:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
system for example
 
05:09:49.368 --> 05:09:49.378 align:start position:0%
and they were identified as a student
 
05:09:52.190 --> 05:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
with a learning disability or in need of
 
05:09:54.350 --> 05:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
related services and then that the
 
05:09:56.810 --> 05:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
parent decides to send the child to a
 
05:09:59.150 --> 05:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
private school which sometimes by the
 
05:10:02.030 --> 05:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
way that is a joint team decision of the
 
05:10:04.430 --> 05:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
public school team at the table with the
 
05:10:06.708 --> 05:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
parent because we've paid tuition a
 
05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
private we've paid tuition at Charter
 
05:10:10.490 --> 05:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
and we've supported homeschool parents
 
05:10:12.288 --> 05:10:12.298 align:start position:0%
at a district level
 
05:10:14.868 --> 05:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
however if the child
 
05:10:18.288 --> 05:10:18.298 align:start position:0%
has services in a public school and then
 
05:10:20.570 --> 05:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
the parent goes to a private just an
 
05:10:23.150 --> 05:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
example is on a scholarship and now
 
05:10:25.490 --> 05:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
wants speech services
 
05:10:27.110 --> 05:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
at the expense of the scholarship
 
05:10:30.170 --> 05:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money it has already been
 
05:10:33.350 --> 05:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
offered as a related service in the
 
05:10:36.708 --> 05:10:36.718 align:start position:0%
public school at no cost other than the
 
05:10:38.628 --> 05:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
cost to the taxpayers
 
05:10:41.330 --> 05:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
but it means that that parent at some
 
05:10:43.250 --> 05:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
point in the team meeting before they
 
05:10:48.410 --> 05:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
withdrew signed a refusal of services
 
05:10:51.410 --> 05:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
so that's important to know because if a
 
05:10:52.970 --> 05:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
parent leaves the district after they've
 
05:10:55.430 --> 05:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
been receiving services and they don't
 
05:10:57.590 --> 05:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
want that speech therapist anymore they
 
05:10:59.390 --> 05:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
don't want that academic intervention
 
05:11:02.270 --> 05:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
for their dyslexia child or whatever
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
disability they have they are signing a
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
document that says I'm refusing services
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't make sense to me
 
05:11:13.730 --> 05:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
to go someplace else get a scholarship
 
05:11:16.250 --> 05:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
and now start looking for some private
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
therapist or online tutoring system to
 
05:11:22.190 --> 05:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
meet that need that's double dipping a
 
05:11:23.990 --> 05:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers so it's just
 
05:11:26.030 --> 05:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
additional information that you need to
 
05:11:28.730 --> 05:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
know this occurs at a district level
 
05:11:30.770 --> 05:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
Administration have to have a
 
05:11:32.990 --> 05:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
relationship with all private schools
 
05:11:34.930 --> 05:11:34.940 align:start position:0%
and families so
 
05:11:37.310 --> 05:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say representative
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
05:11:40.368 --> 05:11:40.378 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
05:11:42.530 --> 05:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to clarify
 
05:11:44.448 --> 05:11:44.458 align:start position:0%
because it seemed that some of the
 
05:11:45.708 --> 05:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
testimony may have conflicted with
 
05:11:48.110 --> 05:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
things we've previously heard on efas
 
05:11:50.868 --> 05:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
is it not true that schools and or
 
05:11:54.590 --> 05:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
districts have the option of billing the
 
05:11:58.610 --> 05:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
EFA program for these classes that EFA
 
05:12:00.708 --> 05:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
students are taking at Public Schools
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of that so I can't really
 
05:12:04.850 --> 05:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
adequately answer that I'm sorry thank
 
05:12:04.860 --> 05:12:05.690 align:start position:0%
adequately answer that I'm sorry thank
you

05:12:05.690 --> 05:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:12:05.700 --> 05:12:07.510 align:start position:0%
you
foreign

05:12:07.510 --> 05:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:12:09.470 --> 05:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:13.730 --> 05:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
um EFA students if they take a course at
 
05:12:16.430 --> 05:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
a public school are required to pay for
 
05:12:18.590 --> 05:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
that under there from their EFA account
 
05:12:21.050 --> 05:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
it's specific in the statute that the
 
05:12:23.690 --> 05:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
public school will not provide tuition
 
05:12:26.030 --> 05:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
to that public school for for that
 
05:12:26.040 --> 05:12:27.590 align:start position:0%
to that public school for for that
course

05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
course
 
05:12:30.470 --> 05:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
um but the the question is
 
05:12:33.770 --> 05:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
um in relation to those Services
 
05:12:37.670 --> 05:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
um that the child is leaving behind
 
05:12:40.190 --> 05:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
um is possible I would think that
 
05:12:42.350 --> 05:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
they're not getting the services that
 
05:12:44.990 --> 05:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
they need in the public school and
 
05:12:46.788 --> 05:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
that's the reason that they're looking
 
05:12:50.330 --> 05:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
for either a tax credit scholarship or
 
05:12:51.850 --> 05:12:51.860 align:start position:0%
an EFA program
 
05:12:55.330 --> 05:12:55.340 align:start position:0%
because they are looking for
 
05:13:00.190 --> 05:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
services that will meet their needs and
 
05:13:03.288 --> 05:13:03.298 align:start position:0%
that EFA
 
05:13:07.250 --> 05:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
account is still partially funded by
 
05:13:10.368 --> 05:13:10.378 align:start position:0%
local tax dollars so they're using their
 
05:13:13.788 --> 05:13:13.798 align:start position:0%
own tax dollars to provide that service
 
05:13:16.368 --> 05:13:16.378 align:start position:0%
that they require so I'm not sure where
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:25.730 --> 05:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
just so that I address what you're
 
05:13:25.740 --> 05:13:27.230 align:start position:0%
just so that I address what you're
saying

05:13:27.230 --> 05:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
saying
 
05:13:31.550 --> 05:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:31.560 --> 05:13:32.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:13:32.810 --> 05:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:35.090 --> 05:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
you know I can't address your answer but
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
I know
 
05:13:36.480 --> 05:13:38.330 align:start position:0%
I know
um

05:13:38.330 --> 05:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:40.310 --> 05:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
I know what you were saying I just drew
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
a blank again um is it possible that you
 
05:13:45.530 --> 05:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
concluding with the homeschooler which
 
05:13:50.090 --> 05:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
can get a you can Bill a 0.15 if we have
 
05:13:52.628 --> 05:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
money available
 
05:13:56.810 --> 05:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
right would the EFA child who's in a
 
05:13:59.750 --> 05:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
different leg of the stool not we have
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
public private we have homeschooling
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
and we have right EFA
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
right so four separate types of meeting
 
05:14:12.288 --> 05:14:12.298 align:start position:0%
the compulsory attendance right but then
 
05:14:14.810 --> 05:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
again the the family that's receiving
 
05:14:17.390 --> 05:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
the EFA if they are living within the
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
school district I mean I don't know what
 
05:14:21.288 --> 05:14:21.298 align:start position:0%
the last two year policies are I'll be
 
05:14:23.270 --> 05:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
honest I mean maybe you do and you can
 
05:14:25.070 --> 05:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
share that but
 
05:14:27.530 --> 05:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
um any child in Ace Public School
 
05:14:29.690 --> 05:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
District has access to any of those
 
05:14:29.700 --> 05:14:31.070 align:start position:0%
District has access to any of those
services

05:14:31.070 --> 05:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:14:33.110 --> 05:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
and if a parent says no I want a
 
05:14:34.610 --> 05:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
Cadillac and you say well we can only
 
05:14:36.110 --> 05:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
provide a Chevy
 
05:14:38.390 --> 05:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
I mean what are you going to do
 
05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
right the police restrictive environment
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
really is the law okay okay further
 
05:14:43.920 --> 05:14:44.930 align:start position:0%
really is the law okay okay further
questions

05:14:44.930 --> 05:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:14:47.390 --> 05:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative Drive
 
05:14:49.550 --> 05:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you could
 
05:14:52.128 --> 05:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
you just from for my help can you show
 
05:14:53.708 --> 05:14:53.718 align:start position:0%
me where
 
05:14:56.270 --> 05:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's you have to extend the opportunity
 
05:14:58.970 --> 05:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
to participate where that's found in
 
05:15:03.010 --> 05:15:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:05.690 --> 05:15:05.700 align:start position:0%
that's other students that students
 
05:15:08.330 --> 05:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
within the district have that option to
 
05:15:10.010 --> 05:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
take classes and courses correct where
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
would I find that in Local District
 
05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
policies and maybe you could access or
 
05:15:16.010 --> 05:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
reach out to um New Hampshire school
 
05:15:17.930 --> 05:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
boards Association they would have a
 
05:15:17.940 --> 05:15:20.090 align:start position:0%
boards Association they would have a
model

05:15:20.090 --> 05:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:22.610 --> 05:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
we also have in co-curricular activities
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
it is and and and and the 0.15 for the
 
05:15:29.030 --> 05:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
homeschooling parent that they're
 
05:15:30.970 --> 05:15:30.980 align:start position:0%
required to extend them where they are
 
05:15:33.288 --> 05:15:33.298 align:start position:0%
technological questions if they're space
 
05:15:36.650 --> 05:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
available and the administration the
 
05:15:39.050 --> 05:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
school says yes you can come and because
 
05:15:40.610 --> 05:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
there's the potential for that high
 
05:15:42.830 --> 05:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
school to receive reimbursement for the
 
05:15:45.530 --> 05:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
time that the the homeschooler is in
 
05:15:48.050 --> 05:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
attendance at the high school okay I
 
05:15:52.250 --> 05:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
think at a 0.15 of the cost of uh
 
05:15:54.770 --> 05:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
a school day basically
 
05:15:57.830 --> 05:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay could represent like us
 
05:15:59.930 --> 05:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:16:04.010 --> 05:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
question I'm still puzzled if the school
 
05:16:06.948 --> 05:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
district has to provide these things to
 
05:16:09.288 --> 05:16:09.298 align:start position:0%
anybody within the district even
 
05:16:12.650 --> 05:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers and if EFA students are
 
05:16:15.470 --> 05:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
required to pay for those things if they
 
05:16:17.810 --> 05:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
get them out of their EFA money
 
05:16:19.970 --> 05:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure why it matters where
 
05:16:21.650 --> 05:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
they're coming from
 
05:16:24.410 --> 05:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
whether it's a private school an EFA a
 
05:16:27.470 --> 05:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
home school or the public school why
 
05:16:29.690 --> 05:16:29.700 align:start position:0%
does it matter since you're providing It
 
05:16:32.030 --> 05:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
Anyways wherever they are and if they're
 
05:16:34.670 --> 05:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
EFA they have to pay for it so why does
 
05:16:37.430 --> 05:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
it matter other than you're getting paid
 
05:16:39.708 --> 05:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
well it's it's probably accountability
 
05:16:43.310 --> 05:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
as well I can only speak that uh federal
 
05:16:43.320 --> 05:16:44.390 align:start position:0%
as well I can only speak that uh federal
law

05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:16:48.350 --> 05:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
you know has a set set process and you
 
05:16:50.270 --> 05:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
know legal requirements on how that
 
05:16:51.890 --> 05:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
process happens
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe rep um
 
05:16:57.310 --> 05:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
Jen palmacato who's here on behalf of
 
05:16:59.930 --> 05:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
nhsaa is a special ed specialist she may
 
05:17:01.810 --> 05:17:01.820 align:start position:0%
be able to answer that better than I can
 
05:17:06.948 --> 05:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
but special ed law is very specific
 
05:17:09.530 --> 05:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna really try to get us back
 
05:17:12.530 --> 05:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
on track because this particular bill is
 
05:17:15.650 --> 05:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
not a bill that's open for questioning
 
05:17:18.850 --> 05:17:18.860 align:start position:0%
on all the EFA areas we're dealing with
 
05:17:21.470 --> 05:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
kindergarten first grade here and let's
 
05:17:23.628 --> 05:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
keep it down to that because we could go
 
05:17:26.030 --> 05:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
all day talking about efas but that's
 
05:17:29.570 --> 05:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
not what we're here for on 4 30.
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
further questions for represent
 
05:17:37.430 --> 05:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:44.930 --> 05:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:44.940 --> 05:17:46.490 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

05:17:46.490 --> 05:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
05:17:49.128 --> 05:17:49.138 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
05:17:51.530 --> 05:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
um my name is Edwin Osborne I'm a 15
 
05:17:54.230 --> 05:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
year old homeschooler and a student at
 
05:17:56.750 --> 05:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
Latitude learning resources which is a
 
05:17:59.390 --> 05:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
homeschool Learning Center in Derry I
 
05:18:02.270 --> 05:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:05.330 --> 05:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
um several of the kids that attend this
 
05:18:07.490 --> 05:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
Learning Center that I go to with that I
 
05:18:09.410 --> 05:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
either I either work with them because
 
05:18:11.208 --> 05:18:11.218 align:start position:0%
they're younger than me or I'm friends
 
05:18:13.190 --> 05:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
with them because they're my age several
 
05:18:15.230 --> 05:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
of them use the education Freedom
 
05:18:17.690 --> 05:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
accounts because they just couldn't
 
05:18:21.170 --> 05:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
they couldn't survive in public school
 
05:18:23.690 --> 05:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
and they had like they had to get out of
 
05:18:26.570 --> 05:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
there and they came to latitude and they
 
05:18:28.610 --> 05:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
used that education Freedom account
 
05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
money to do so
 
05:18:34.510 --> 05:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
this bill if passed would prevent
 
05:18:39.530 --> 05:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
non-current EFA students from attending
 
05:18:41.750 --> 05:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
my Learning Center as well as other
 
05:18:45.590 --> 05:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
similar places or a private school
 
05:18:48.050 --> 05:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
anything else really that helps them get
 
05:18:49.670 --> 05:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
out of public school because Public
 
05:18:49.680 --> 05:18:50.810 align:start position:0%
out of public school because Public
School

05:18:50.810 --> 05:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
School
 
05:18:54.110 --> 05:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
damages children it's not a safe
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
learning environment I've talked to my
 
05:18:58.430 --> 05:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
several of my friends and acquaintances
 
05:19:01.070 --> 05:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
who have been in public school
 
05:19:04.550 --> 05:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
and they've dealt with they've seen some
 
05:19:06.890 --> 05:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
stuff they've heard some stuff it's just
 
05:19:11.090 --> 05:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
overall not safe not
 
05:19:13.910 --> 05:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
they don't learn as much as they should
 
05:19:17.448 --> 05:19:17.458 align:start position:0%
and forcing someone to have that year of
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
public education under their belt before
 
05:19:22.070 --> 05:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
they can apply for an for an education
 
05:19:25.128 --> 05:19:25.138 align:start position:0%
Freedom account it's just not fair
 
05:19:28.070 --> 05:19:28.080 align:start position:0%

last year and I think that's where he
 
05:32:36.350 --> 05:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
feels is up to
 
05:32:39.310 --> 05:32:39.320 align:start position:0%

Hebron before I retired I worked at the
 
05:33:12.470 --> 05:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for 30 years and
 
05:33:14.570 --> 05:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
I worked with school funding formulas
 
05:33:14.580 --> 05:33:16.128 align:start position:0%
I worked with school funding formulas
and

05:33:16.128 --> 05:33:16.138 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:19.730 --> 05:33:19.740 align:start position:0%

I have I do have a little background
 
05:33:33.650 --> 05:33:33.660 align:start position:0%
with um this sort of thing
 
05:33:36.350 --> 05:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
so we have an education funding crisis
 
05:33:39.830 --> 05:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire property taxpayers have
 
05:33:46.030 --> 05:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
no choice but to Bear 71 of the cost of
 
05:33:48.830 --> 05:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
educating students in our local schools
 
05:33:52.128 --> 05:33:52.138 align:start position:0%
because the state with a con which has a
 
05:33:54.230 --> 05:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional responsibility to provide
 
05:33:56.390 --> 05:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
an adequate education and pay for it
 
05:33:58.910 --> 05:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
covers only about 21 percent of that
 
05:33:58.920 --> 05:33:59.690 align:start position:0%
covers only about 21 percent of that
cost

05:33:59.690 --> 05:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:34:03.230 --> 05:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
there is no other state that downshifts
 
05:34:06.050 --> 05:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
so much of the cost of Education onto
 
05:34:08.510 --> 05:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners and small business owners in
 
05:34:10.850 --> 05:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
the form of property taxes
 
05:34:14.448 --> 05:34:14.458 align:start position:0%
and property taxes High property taxes
 
05:34:18.170 --> 05:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
impact everybody in the community it
 
05:34:21.470 --> 05:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
increases rental costs and it causes
 
05:34:23.628 --> 05:34:23.638 align:start position:0%
some retirees to have to move out of
 
05:34:25.368 --> 05:34:25.378 align:start position:0%
their homes because the taxes are so
 
05:34:25.378 --> 05:34:26.948 align:start position:0%
their homes because the taxes are so
high

05:34:26.948 --> 05:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
high
 
05:34:30.948 --> 05:34:30.958 align:start position:0%
this year's adequacy Aid includes a
 
05:34:34.190 --> 05:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollar reduction to the
 
05:34:37.430 --> 05:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax which has lowered
 
05:34:39.948 --> 05:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
property tax bills collectively across
 
05:34:42.830 --> 05:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
the state by about 100 million dollars
 
05:34:45.770 --> 05:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
but this is a one-time deal and it will
 
05:34:48.288 --> 05:34:48.298 align:start position:0%
expire and property taxes will go back
 
05:34:50.150 --> 05:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
up in December
 
05:34:56.948 --> 05:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
so what hb20 529 does is it uses
 
05:34:59.770 --> 05:34:59.780 align:start position:0%
approximately the same amount of money
 
05:35:03.708 --> 05:35:03.718 align:start position:0%
and it's actually a little less and it
 
05:35:05.750 --> 05:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
returns that money
 
05:35:09.708 --> 05:35:09.718 align:start position:0%
um in a different format the current so
 
05:35:11.750 --> 05:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's the same level of it cost to stay
 
05:35:14.270 --> 05:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
the same but the money is distributed
 
05:35:17.570 --> 05:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
differently there are two components to
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
this funding package one of them is
 
05:35:23.990 --> 05:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
called fiscal capacity disparity Aid and
 
05:35:26.628 --> 05:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
and compared to the current
 
05:35:31.010 --> 05:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
um tax relief it shifts more Aid to
 
05:35:33.170 --> 05:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
communities that have lower property
 
05:35:33.180 --> 05:35:34.570 align:start position:0%
communities that have lower property
values

05:35:34.570 --> 05:35:34.580 align:start position:0%
values
 
05:35:39.170 --> 05:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
and the free and reduced meal Aid is
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
allocated based on the percentage of
 
05:35:43.550 --> 05:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
students that are eligible for free and
 
05:35:46.850 --> 05:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
reduced price meals and that is pretty
 
05:35:50.390 --> 05:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
much a proxy measure for income wealth
 
05:35:52.850 --> 05:35:52.860 align:start position:0%
since the LBA has not yet prepared a
 
05:35:56.990 --> 05:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I used information from the
 
05:35:59.270 --> 05:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
Doe's website the spreadsheet that they
 
05:36:03.470 --> 05:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
have on there for the fy04
 
05:36:06.590 --> 05:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid allocation based on the
 
05:36:10.190 --> 05:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
current law and I made modifications to
 
05:36:15.230 --> 05:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:17.690 --> 05:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
um there is a couple of things that I
 
05:36:21.050 --> 05:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
need to tell you in on the bill let me
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:33.288 --> 05:36:33.298 align:start position:0%
on the first page on line 20
 
05:36:35.930 --> 05:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
there's drafting problem which is my
 
05:36:38.510 --> 05:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
fault at the end of that line it should
 
05:36:41.510 --> 05:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
say times the admr
 
05:36:44.510 --> 05:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
because otherwise the municipality would
 
05:36:48.350 --> 05:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
get the aid that one student is entitled
 
05:36:51.650 --> 05:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:53.930 --> 05:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
I think um
 
05:36:58.850 --> 05:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:01.670 --> 05:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
um thing that I can that I know of that
 
05:37:03.890 --> 05:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
is an issue with the way that this is
 
05:37:05.390 --> 05:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
drafted so I'd be happy to take
 
05:37:08.208 --> 05:37:08.218 align:start position:0%
anybody's questions about the
 
05:37:10.128 --> 05:37:10.138 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet or the formula or anything
 
05:37:12.830 --> 05:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
else related to the bill representative
 
05:37:15.170 --> 05:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
fellows are there any questions
 
05:37:17.510 --> 05:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tanner
 
05:37:19.430 --> 05:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for bringing
 
05:37:20.448 --> 05:37:20.458 align:start position:0%
this forward
 
05:37:21.890 --> 05:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
um could you just go back over that
 
05:37:23.750 --> 05:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
correction and read the sentence to us
 
05:37:25.670 --> 05:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
as it should be corrected so on the
 
05:37:28.010 --> 05:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
first page on line 20
 
05:37:31.910 --> 05:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
the whole sentence starts on line 18 and
 
05:37:35.390 --> 05:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
it says a municipate municipality with
 
05:37:38.448 --> 05:37:38.458 align:start position:0%
an equalized valuation per admr greater
 
05:37:42.530 --> 05:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
than 600 000 but less than one million
 
05:37:47.288 --> 05:37:47.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:50.628 --> 05:37:50.638 align:start position:0%
0.002 cents for each dollar of
 
05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
difference between the equalized
 
05:37:56.448 --> 05:37:56.458 align:start position:0%
valuation per admr and one million six
 
05:37:59.868 --> 05:37:59.878 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars and what you
 
05:38:02.150 --> 05:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
need to write in right after that is
 
05:38:06.948 --> 05:38:06.958 align:start position:0%
times the admr so if you look up at line
 
05:38:10.730 --> 05:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 it has pretty much the same
 
05:38:14.090 --> 05:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
construction to it
 
05:38:16.430 --> 05:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
both of them both of them have a per
 
05:38:19.868 --> 05:38:19.878 align:start position:0%
pupil amount and then you
 
05:38:22.670 --> 05:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
multiply that times the number of
 
05:38:26.330 --> 05:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:29.750 --> 05:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
further questions represent Belcher
 
05:38:32.270 --> 05:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:38:33.948 --> 05:38:33.958 align:start position:0%
um so looking again at the the the
 
05:38:35.930 --> 05:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of New Hampshire and the
 
05:38:38.030 --> 05:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
concept of an adequate education and
 
05:38:40.448 --> 05:38:40.458 align:start position:0%
funding and adequate education
 
05:38:43.490 --> 05:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
is there we already have a number of
 
05:38:45.530 --> 05:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
programs that that would shift and
 
05:38:48.650 --> 05:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
offset more State money to you could say
 
05:38:50.990 --> 05:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
poorer communities communities of more
 
05:38:51.000 --> 05:38:51.948 align:start position:0%
poorer communities communities of more
need

05:38:51.948 --> 05:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
need
 
05:38:54.310 --> 05:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
than communities that may be wealthier
 
05:38:58.368 --> 05:38:58.378 align:start position:0%
is there ever a point that we could
 
05:39:00.890 --> 05:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
shift so much relative funding from the
 
05:39:02.628 --> 05:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
state to these poorer communities versus
 
05:39:04.670 --> 05:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
wealthier communities that we might
 
05:39:06.350 --> 05:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
actually be considered not adequately
 
05:39:08.448 --> 05:39:08.458 align:start position:0%
funding an education in the wealthier
 
05:39:08.458 --> 05:39:10.868 align:start position:0%
funding an education in the wealthier
communities

05:39:10.868 --> 05:39:10.878 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:39:15.350 --> 05:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
I see I understand so I was following
 
05:39:18.650 --> 05:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
you up in up until the end there are you
 
05:39:20.948 --> 05:39:20.958 align:start position:0%
know there are many ways that the state
 
05:39:24.288 --> 05:39:24.298 align:start position:0%
sends money to communities uh not just
 
05:39:27.110 --> 05:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
for education for you know room and
 
05:39:28.910 --> 05:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
meals tax distribution that kind of
 
05:39:32.770 --> 05:39:32.780 align:start position:0%
stuff and the Constitutional
 
05:39:36.288 --> 05:39:36.298 align:start position:0%
requirement is that that was determined
 
05:39:38.090 --> 05:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
by The Claremont ruling which was about
 
05:39:39.890 --> 05:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
20 years ago
 
05:39:41.628 --> 05:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
said that it's the state's
 
05:39:45.890 --> 05:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
responsibility to determine what is an
 
05:39:48.410 --> 05:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
05:39:51.890 --> 05:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
figure out how much that costs
 
05:39:53.810 --> 05:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
05:39:56.030 --> 05:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
and then it there's also a provision
 
05:39:59.570 --> 05:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
that it should of our accountability you
 
05:40:01.628 --> 05:40:01.638 align:start position:0%
know to make sure that that is actually
 
05:40:04.788 --> 05:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
that the adequate education actually
 
05:40:07.910 --> 05:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's opportunity for an adequate
 
05:40:11.390 --> 05:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
education is actually happening
 
05:40:13.250 --> 05:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
let me follow up just to clarify a
 
05:40:14.930 --> 05:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
little little better I guess what I'm
 
05:40:17.270 --> 05:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
getting at is given the I guess you
 
05:40:19.310 --> 05:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
would call it a a progressive system
 
05:40:22.368 --> 05:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
where we're more funding is shifted from
 
05:40:24.730 --> 05:40:24.740 align:start position:0%
the state to the poorer communities
 
05:40:27.850 --> 05:40:27.860 align:start position:0%
but we also have a responsibility to
 
05:40:30.350 --> 05:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
relatively fund the wealthier
 
05:40:31.788 --> 05:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
communities as well under that Supreme
 
05:40:34.190 --> 05:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
Court decision correct oh okay so we're
 
05:40:36.170 --> 05:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
just talking about education funding
 
05:40:38.270 --> 05:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
correct oh
 
05:40:41.628 --> 05:40:41.638 align:start position:0%
um yeah the constant that Claremont
 
05:40:44.470 --> 05:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
um suit ruling
 
05:40:48.050 --> 05:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
said that the state was responsible for
 
05:40:51.230 --> 05:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
paying for an adequate education
 
05:40:51.240 --> 05:40:52.850 align:start position:0%
paying for an adequate education
and

05:40:52.850 --> 05:40:52.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:40:55.970 --> 05:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not a lawyer but my
 
05:40:58.430 --> 05:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that would be
 
05:41:01.070 --> 05:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
for every community
 
05:41:03.350 --> 05:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
but it also
 
05:41:09.230 --> 05:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
um does does not mean that the state has
 
05:41:11.990 --> 05:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
to pay for every dollar either because
 
05:41:14.530 --> 05:41:14.540 align:start position:0%
there could be things that go beyond
 
05:41:17.208 --> 05:41:17.218 align:start position:0%
what what meets the definition of
 
05:41:19.070 --> 05:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
adequate thank you
 
05:41:21.708 --> 05:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
representative and just a quick look at
 
05:41:24.350 --> 05:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
this bill right now this bill appears to
 
05:41:28.970 --> 05:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
me to have a similar type process
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
um built upon what came out when
 
05:41:34.750 --> 05:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Ford helped us back in 2018
 
05:41:36.770 --> 05:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
with this
 
05:41:40.010 --> 05:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
gradually down formula and now follow
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
through with current law is that correct
 
05:41:44.510 --> 05:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the numbers look a
 
05:41:45.708 --> 05:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
little bit different
 
05:41:49.010 --> 05:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
but the process and the principle behind
 
05:41:49.020 --> 05:41:49.850 align:start position:0%
but the process and the principle behind
this

05:41:49.850 --> 05:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:41:52.490 --> 05:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
is not a change is that correct I I
 
05:41:55.628 --> 05:41:55.638 align:start position:0%
would you know I can't okay
 
05:41:57.948 --> 05:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
so he'd talk about it when he gets up
 
05:42:00.708 --> 05:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
yeah this because I didn't sponsor the
 
05:42:03.170 --> 05:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
other Bill and and I'm and when was the
 
05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
other Bill well this this is now it's
 
05:42:10.190 --> 05:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
about five years later after we're not
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
we worked with Jeff for that was the
 
05:42:14.448 --> 05:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
Karen umberger study
 
05:42:16.490 --> 05:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
we came up with a formula like this
 
05:42:19.010 --> 05:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
where you know it the when you get down
 
05:42:21.948 --> 05:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
like 600 dollars per pupil equalized
 
05:42:24.590 --> 05:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
property valuation you would get more
 
05:42:26.690 --> 05:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
support and it would gradually filter
 
05:42:28.610 --> 05:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
way to nothing and I I don't know I
 
05:42:30.530 --> 05:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
can't remember was one point
 
05:42:33.470 --> 05:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
two four million words it's it's stopped
 
05:42:36.708 --> 05:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
it was something in that vicinity 2018
 
05:42:40.128 --> 05:42:40.138 align:start position:0%
yeah it was 2018. so so representative
 
05:42:42.948 --> 05:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
lad you know over the years over over
 
05:42:45.590 --> 05:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
the the um I started work at the
 
05:42:48.770 --> 05:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in 1985 and my
 
05:42:51.830 --> 05:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
very first assignment was to use an IBM
 
05:42:54.650 --> 05:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
PC to write an a distribution formula
 
05:42:56.750 --> 05:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
for governor sununu and that would be
 
05:43:00.368 --> 05:43:00.378 align:start position:0%
the first governor sununu and since then
 
05:43:03.050 --> 05:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
you know every year there's been some
 
05:43:05.770 --> 05:43:05.780 align:start position:0%
sort of proposal to change it and and
 
05:43:08.868 --> 05:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
there are so many options and it never
 
05:43:11.448 --> 05:43:11.458 align:start position:0%
ceases to amaze me we just keep going so
 
05:43:12.650 --> 05:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
05:43:16.910 --> 05:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:18.770 --> 05:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:43:19.850 --> 05:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
being here
 
05:43:23.448 --> 05:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
so we've had I'm interested in your
 
05:43:26.090 --> 05:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
history at the department dealing with
 
05:43:27.288 --> 05:43:27.298 align:start position:0%
school aid
 
05:43:29.830 --> 05:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
so we've had Claremont one Claremont 2
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
Londonderry Dover
 
05:43:35.810 --> 05:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
in all those in all those Court
 
05:43:38.270 --> 05:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
decisions they basically have said that
 
05:43:39.948 --> 05:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
the current funding system is not fair
 
05:43:41.930 --> 05:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
does not meet the Constitutional
 
05:43:41.940 --> 05:43:43.788 align:start position:0%
does not meet the Constitutional
requirement

05:43:43.788 --> 05:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
would you concur with a statement that
 
05:43:47.810 --> 05:43:47.820 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:43:50.628 --> 05:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
the legislature has yet
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
to comply
 
05:43:55.788 --> 05:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:59.810 --> 05:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
I would definitely agree that since
 
05:44:03.250 --> 05:44:03.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:07.310 --> 05:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
the state has although they responded to
 
05:44:11.868 --> 05:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
the Claremont suit in 1999 has yet to
 
05:44:14.750 --> 05:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
even come close to
 
05:44:17.868 --> 05:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
doing what the Court ruling said we
 
05:44:21.650 --> 05:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
needed to do thank you further questions
 
05:44:26.030 --> 05:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:28.910 --> 05:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so follow-up to
 
05:44:31.250 --> 05:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative miler's question
 
05:44:34.190 --> 05:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
how much does this proposed Bill do to
 
05:44:36.590 --> 05:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
address the reality of not having met
 
05:44:40.430 --> 05:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:42.530 --> 05:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
we are so far
 
05:44:44.570 --> 05:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
meeting what the courts told us we
 
05:44:47.330 --> 05:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
needed to do that it's almost like that
 
05:44:49.548 --> 05:44:49.558 align:start position:0%
question isn't even relevant
 
05:44:54.230 --> 05:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
but I can say what this formula does is
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's a Band-Aid it's a Band-Aid on a
 
05:45:01.270 --> 05:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
system that has many
 
05:45:05.570 --> 05:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
deficiencies and is bleeding in many
 
05:45:08.810 --> 05:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
ways and this is just one Band-Aid on
 
05:45:12.590 --> 05:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:14.030 --> 05:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
dates all the way back to Senator
 
05:45:16.730 --> 05:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
Estabrook and further
 
05:45:20.090 --> 05:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
alrighty so any further questions
 
05:45:21.890 --> 05:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:45:23.390 --> 05:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me yep
 
05:45:33.770 --> 05:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:36.350 --> 05:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and members
 
05:45:38.628 --> 05:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
of the members of the committee for the
 
05:45:40.788 --> 05:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
record Dave luno uh representing the
 
05:45:43.788 --> 05:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
people of Merrimack County District 9
 
05:45:45.830 --> 05:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
um who live in the towns of Bowen
 
05:45:45.840 --> 05:45:47.208 align:start position:0%
um who live in the towns of Bowen
Hopkinton

05:45:47.208 --> 05:45:47.218 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton
 
05:45:50.090 --> 05:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have any prepared remarks
 
05:45:51.590 --> 05:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
for today
 
05:45:53.270 --> 05:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
um there was a lot of preparation that I
 
05:45:55.128 --> 05:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
think went into this Rick and mellow
 
05:45:58.970 --> 05:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
were both on this um and Dr cascadden on
 
05:46:01.850 --> 05:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
this um uh uh school funding commission
 
05:46:05.030 --> 05:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
which met during pretty much the whole
 
05:46:08.030 --> 05:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
year of 2020 except for a few months
 
05:46:09.470 --> 05:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
right at the beginning of the pandemic
 
05:46:12.350 --> 05:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out how to do do
 
05:46:16.010 --> 05:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
Zoom meetings securely and we conducted
 
05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
most of our work nearly 200 hours of
 
05:46:22.368 --> 05:46:22.378 align:start position:0%
public meeting and public comments and
 
05:46:25.150 --> 05:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
and subcommittee meetings
 
05:46:29.090 --> 05:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
remotely and it was tough
 
05:46:32.090 --> 05:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
um uh but uh but we were able to
 
05:46:35.330 --> 05:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
um to to publish a report in December of
 
05:46:38.270 --> 05:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
2020. some of the numbers are out of
 
05:46:40.910 --> 05:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
date but but most of this is policy
 
05:46:42.770 --> 05:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
related recommendations and there may
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
still be copies of this report in the in
 
05:46:47.510 --> 05:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
the office here
 
05:46:50.030 --> 05:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
um if not I'd probably scare up a few
 
05:46:52.430 --> 05:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
and there's also online it's available
 
05:46:55.128 --> 05:46:55.138 align:start position:0%
online uh through the UNH car seat
 
05:46:56.868 --> 05:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
school and I can provide anybody with
 
05:47:01.310 --> 05:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
the um with the link to that but um but
 
05:47:03.650 --> 05:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
um you know it was it was good to see
 
05:47:05.330 --> 05:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
representative Schoenberg reference
 
05:47:08.690 --> 05:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
reference this um uh this morning that
 
05:47:11.868 --> 05:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot uh to the um the
 
05:47:14.448 --> 05:47:14.458 align:start position:0%
information in the report it covers a
 
05:47:16.670 --> 05:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
wide variety of subjects everywhere from
 
05:47:16.680 --> 05:47:18.170 align:start position:0%
wide variety of subjects everywhere from
from

05:47:18.170 --> 05:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:47:20.990 --> 05:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
um you know students and schools and
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
transportation and Technical education
 
05:47:26.890 --> 05:47:26.900 align:start position:0%
and special education
 
05:47:32.930 --> 05:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
and taxes and revenue sources and uh and
 
05:47:35.570 --> 05:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh and the con belt suits uh sorry the
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
Claremont suits Claremont one two and
 
05:47:41.690 --> 05:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
Londonderry and uh and so uh there were
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
a couple of attorneys on um on the
 
05:47:47.448 --> 05:47:47.458 align:start position:0%
commission as well who weighed in
 
05:47:48.890 --> 05:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
particularly on the those Supreme Court
 
05:47:50.570 --> 05:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
opinions and I think some of the
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
questions that have come up today it
 
05:47:55.310 --> 05:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
would be interesting to read what what
 
05:47:58.368 --> 05:47:58.378 align:start position:0%
those attorneys both um both the
 
05:48:01.010 --> 05:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
Republican and Democrat had to uh had to
 
05:48:02.990 --> 05:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
say with respect to uh to the Supreme
 
05:48:04.670 --> 05:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
Court rulings but I'm not going to spend
 
05:48:07.190 --> 05:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of time on this I do want to
 
05:48:09.948 --> 05:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
uh have a have a couple remarks on on
 
05:48:12.470 --> 05:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
529 and a little bit of the case history
 
05:48:15.708 --> 05:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
that that uh that chairman Ladd uh was
 
05:48:16.970 --> 05:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:48:19.570 --> 05:48:19.580 align:start position:0%
um very quickly though House Bill 529
 
05:48:22.190 --> 05:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
make no mistake I mean actually I think
 
05:48:23.868 --> 05:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
representative Damon's question was
 
05:48:26.330 --> 05:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
right on it is not comprehensive school
 
05:48:29.170 --> 05:48:29.180 align:start position:0%
funding reform it isn't even adequacy
 
05:48:32.628 --> 05:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's built on top of adequacy so it
 
05:48:34.090 --> 05:48:34.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the adequacy definition
 
05:48:36.410 --> 05:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the costing out of
 
05:48:40.010 --> 05:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
adequacy it it specifically puts in
 
05:48:43.970 --> 05:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
place two uh two uh state grants that
 
05:48:46.190 --> 05:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
we've had in place before a fiscal
 
05:48:49.190 --> 05:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Grant and then an
 
05:48:52.070 --> 05:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
enhanced free and reduced price lunch
 
05:48:55.868 --> 05:48:55.878 align:start position:0%
Grant whether that becomes a a
 
05:48:58.430 --> 05:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification Grant or
 
05:49:01.850 --> 05:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
we can call it something else but um uh
 
05:49:05.150 --> 05:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
but basically that that recognizes the
 
05:49:08.150 --> 05:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
additional costs that uh that school
 
05:49:09.530 --> 05:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
districts with with higher
 
05:49:13.128 --> 05:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
concentrations of of low-income students
 
05:49:17.510 --> 05:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
um uh in it so but um but quickly on the
 
05:49:19.430 --> 05:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
on the commission when looking at
 
05:49:21.948 --> 05:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
comprehensive reform uh the the
 
05:49:23.390 --> 05:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
commission really came down in three
 
05:49:25.810 --> 05:49:25.820 align:start position:0%
areas defining adequacy
 
05:49:28.730 --> 05:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad talked about how you
 
05:49:30.650 --> 05:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
know that comes right out of right out
 
05:49:32.150 --> 05:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
of Claremont
 
05:49:34.730 --> 05:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
um and defining adequacy in terms of
 
05:49:37.010 --> 05:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
student performance
 
05:49:39.708 --> 05:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
um the second piece is costing out
 
05:49:41.868 --> 05:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
inadequate education what does it cost
 
05:49:43.730 --> 05:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
to do that what does it cost to get that
 
05:49:46.368 --> 05:49:46.378 align:start position:0%
that High student outcome that we're
 
05:49:48.410 --> 05:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
also proud of here in New Hampshire top
 
05:49:51.230 --> 05:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
five or six in the country so so I mean
 
05:49:53.208 --> 05:49:53.218 align:start position:0%
we can argue other things but top five
 
05:49:55.010 --> 05:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
or six in the country is certainly
 
05:49:58.010 --> 05:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
something that that we can be proud of
 
05:49:58.020 --> 05:49:58.610 align:start position:0%
something that that we can be proud of
um

05:49:58.610 --> 05:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh here in New Hampshire and then the
 
05:50:03.830 --> 05:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
third piece and uh and this is really
 
05:50:05.390 --> 05:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
the important part and this is the part
 
05:50:09.350 --> 05:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
that really falls out of the um uh you
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
know it's beyond defining adequacy and
 
05:50:13.970 --> 05:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
costing adversely the third piece making
 
05:50:16.730 --> 05:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
sure that every school district has
 
05:50:20.448 --> 05:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
access to the resources they need
 
05:50:22.788 --> 05:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
to fund their inadequate education for
 
05:50:25.910 --> 05:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
all their students and um and and and
 
05:50:28.070 --> 05:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's a really important point it's
 
05:50:29.448 --> 05:50:29.458 align:start position:0%
important to look at that separately
 
05:50:31.250 --> 05:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
because that's one of the one of the
 
05:50:33.530 --> 05:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
main conclusions of the commission work
 
05:50:37.070 --> 05:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
is that costing and funding are two
 
05:50:39.110 --> 05:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
different things
 
05:50:42.170 --> 05:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
um and um and we won't belabor that
 
05:50:43.850 --> 05:50:43.860 align:start position:0%
today because that's not what this bill
 
05:50:45.470 --> 05:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
is about but but that's what
 
05:50:47.628 --> 05:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
comprehensive school funding
 
05:50:50.930 --> 05:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
um is about so um we talked about it
 
05:50:54.048 --> 05:50:54.058 align:start position:0%
early actually a couple times today New
 
05:50:56.270 --> 05:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's adequacy is defined in 198
 
05:51:01.128 --> 05:51:01.138 align:start position:0%
colon 40 a and uh and it recognizes that
 
05:51:03.708 --> 05:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
um that uh that adequacy
 
05:51:07.310 --> 05:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
um can be uh can be defined uh or can be
 
05:51:09.410 --> 05:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
costed in terms of student outcomes
 
05:51:10.970 --> 05:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
because that's exactly what our
 
05:51:13.430 --> 05:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid factors are and we've
 
05:51:15.410 --> 05:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
got several we heard about one this
 
05:51:18.230 --> 05:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
morning with um with third grade reading
 
05:51:20.390 --> 05:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
so that's a factor English language
 
05:51:22.190 --> 05:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
which learning is a factor special
 
05:51:24.708 --> 05:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
education is a factor and free and
 
05:51:27.410 --> 05:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch concentrations as a
 
05:51:29.690 --> 05:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
proxy for low-income populations in the
 
05:51:32.810 --> 05:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
district that's a factor so we know that
 
05:51:35.208 --> 05:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
that there are that that there are there
 
05:51:37.430 --> 05:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
probably using the word wrong
 
05:51:39.310 --> 05:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
um uh extent
 
05:51:43.368 --> 05:51:43.378 align:start position:0%
extending extensive extenuating factors
 
05:51:47.150 --> 05:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
that that that lead to costs that a
 
05:51:49.788 --> 05:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
district would incur to educate all of
 
05:51:52.128 --> 05:51:52.138 align:start position:0%
its all of its students
 
05:51:55.390 --> 05:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
um but um but and and and and and and
 
05:51:59.030 --> 05:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 529 does try to get at one of
 
05:52:01.430 --> 05:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
those factors particularly the um the
 
05:52:03.530 --> 05:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
the low income Factor
 
05:52:06.288 --> 05:52:06.298 align:start position:0%
um so uh the um
 
05:52:08.570 --> 05:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's also I think important to
 
05:52:10.250 --> 05:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
share a little bit about what our
 
05:52:11.570 --> 05:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
neighbors to the South do because
 
05:52:13.910 --> 05:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
they're also in that sort of top five
 
05:52:15.230 --> 05:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:52:18.830 --> 05:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
um of student performance nationally but
 
05:52:23.628 --> 05:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts doesn't Implement a uh a
 
05:52:25.490 --> 05:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
definition of adequacy based on student
 
05:52:29.208 --> 05:52:29.218 align:start position:0%
outcomes or recognizing that uh that
 
05:52:31.670 --> 05:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
that schools and and
 
05:52:35.150 --> 05:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
um and and the students there are aren't
 
05:52:38.510 --> 05:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know are it doesn't
 
05:52:39.948 --> 05:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
recognize that they're different you
 
05:52:41.990 --> 05:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
know it's it's different Wellesley than
 
05:52:44.150 --> 05:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
it is in Lawrence and so so
 
05:52:47.390 --> 05:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has much more of a flat
 
05:52:49.730 --> 05:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
funding type of model and actually New
 
05:52:51.350 --> 05:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's funding model is largely
 
05:52:53.090 --> 05:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
flat funding except for that little bit
 
05:52:55.190 --> 05:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
of you know you know
 
05:52:59.330 --> 05:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
um uh differential Aid uh and um
 
05:53:02.448 --> 05:53:02.458 align:start position:0%
and what Massachusetts is finding out
 
05:53:04.810 --> 05:53:04.820 align:start position:0%
from that is that student achievement
 
05:53:08.990 --> 05:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
across these districts varies widely so
 
05:53:12.230 --> 05:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
um so so they haven't been able to solve
 
05:53:14.628 --> 05:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
the um the student achievement or the
 
05:53:17.090 --> 05:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
student Equity Gap they've solved the
 
05:53:19.788 --> 05:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayer Equity Gap we haven't solved
 
05:53:22.250 --> 05:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
either one of those things in our in our
 
05:53:25.670 --> 05:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
current model we've got taxpayer
 
05:53:29.150 --> 05:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
um you know well you know the report
 
05:53:31.070 --> 05:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
sums it up pretty clearly that New
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding formula fails
 
05:53:35.090 --> 05:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
both taxpayers and students across the
 
05:53:36.708 --> 05:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
state and I think we're going to hear a
 
05:53:37.910 --> 05:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
05:53:39.830 --> 05:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
um a little bit about that
 
05:53:39.840 --> 05:53:40.430 align:start position:0%
um a little bit about that
um

05:53:40.430 --> 05:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:44.390 --> 05:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
but um back to 529
 
05:53:47.990 --> 05:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
um it's not comprehensive reform as
 
05:53:50.330 --> 05:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative fellows said
 
05:53:52.788 --> 05:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
it's really you know it's really a light
 
05:53:52.798 --> 05:53:54.048 align:start position:0%
it's really you know it's really a light
touch

05:53:54.048 --> 05:53:54.058 align:start position:0%
touch
 
05:53:55.730 --> 05:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a hundred million dollars
 
05:53:58.430 --> 05:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
almost 100 million dollars uh but that's
 
05:54:01.190 --> 05:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars out of 3.2 billion
 
05:54:03.288 --> 05:54:03.298 align:start position:0%
dollars that we spend here in New
 
05:54:04.970 --> 05:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you want comprehensive
 
05:54:07.190 --> 05:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
reform in New Hampshire you take what
 
05:54:09.470 --> 05:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
the state spends
 
05:54:14.208 --> 05:54:14.218 align:start position:0%
um uh and um and you know
 
05:54:18.470 --> 05:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
use that as a as a number that you that
 
05:54:19.670 --> 05:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
you invest
 
05:54:21.770 --> 05:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
um in in costing out inadequate
 
05:54:23.930 --> 05:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
education and making sure that districts
 
05:54:25.490 --> 05:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
have the access to the resources they
 
05:54:28.368 --> 05:54:28.378 align:start position:0%
need so in this case it's using part of
 
05:54:29.330 --> 05:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
that hundred million dollars
 
05:54:32.090 --> 05:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
specifically about 70 million 80 million
 
05:54:34.010 --> 05:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
dollars sorry uh to make sure that
 
05:54:35.750 --> 05:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
districts have access to the resources
 
05:54:38.570 --> 05:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
they need you know I think um mayor
 
05:54:41.090 --> 05:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
Craig from Manchester would probably say
 
05:54:43.368 --> 05:54:43.378 align:start position:0%
that Manchester could use that whole 80
 
05:54:45.110 --> 05:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars itself and even with
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't uh and representative
 
05:54:48.650 --> 05:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
Cornell would certainly agree with that
 
05:54:50.990 --> 05:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
and even with that they wouldn't come up
 
05:54:52.610 --> 05:54:52.620 align:start position:0%
to the average per pupil spending
 
05:54:54.708 --> 05:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
anywhere close to the average per pupil
 
05:54:57.070 --> 05:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
spending that um that we've got here
 
05:54:59.270 --> 05:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
that we heard from representative
 
05:55:02.448 --> 05:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
Schoenberg this morning so um House Bill
 
05:55:05.690 --> 05:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
529 is something that that we think
 
05:55:08.628 --> 05:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
could be possible this year and you know
 
05:55:10.310 --> 05:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
obviously we've got a very challenging
 
05:55:12.650 --> 05:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
session we've got really tight tight
 
05:55:16.128 --> 05:55:16.138 align:start position:0%
numbers but I think I think you know uh
 
05:55:19.128 --> 05:55:19.138 align:start position:0%
people on both sides of the aisle are
 
05:55:21.470 --> 05:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
certainly representing constituents that
 
05:55:23.628 --> 05:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
that feel the pressure of property taxes
 
05:55:26.930 --> 05:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
and are looking for some some relief and
 
05:55:29.690 --> 05:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
um and 529 does that the biggest part of
 
05:55:34.730 --> 05:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
529 is is is uh is is tax relief that's
 
05:55:36.708 --> 05:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
the 80 million dollar part
 
05:55:38.270 --> 05:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
um on that
 
05:55:40.610 --> 05:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
um and it has a sliding scale we'll get
 
05:55:43.730 --> 05:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
into that shortly the um
 
05:55:46.970 --> 05:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
um it also recognizes that uh that there
 
05:55:49.788 --> 05:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
are extenuating factors particularly the
 
05:55:52.610 --> 05:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
free the the low income factor and it
 
05:55:55.430 --> 05:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
directs 17 million dollars towards uh
 
05:55:56.868 --> 05:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
towards districts with higher
 
05:56:00.830 --> 05:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
concentrations of um of uh of uh
 
05:56:03.470 --> 05:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
students from from you know low-income
 
05:56:06.230 --> 05:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
households and so this is actually a
 
05:56:08.868 --> 05:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
very similar to Senate Bill 420 which we
 
05:56:11.448 --> 05:56:11.458 align:start position:0%
passed last year which um by the way I
 
05:56:13.970 --> 05:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
think had a um had very close to a 17
 
05:56:15.288 --> 05:56:15.298 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
05:56:17.448 --> 05:56:17.458 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:56:20.208 --> 05:56:20.218 align:start position:0%
enhance reintroduced price price lunch
 
05:56:23.090 --> 05:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
component to it so so House Bill 529
 
05:56:25.570 --> 05:56:25.580 align:start position:0%
essentially doubles that extraordinary
 
05:56:30.368 --> 05:56:30.378 align:start position:0%
needs Grant and um and
 
05:56:34.010 --> 05:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
and it also you know it it doesn't it
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't do 529 doesn't do this but we're
 
05:56:38.448 --> 05:56:38.458 align:start position:0%
going to hear another bill in a few days
 
05:56:42.170 --> 05:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 540 uh which is um uh
 
05:56:44.628 --> 05:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored by by Representatives lad
 
05:56:48.288 --> 05:56:48.298 align:start position:0%
Miler uh cordelian Ward uh that that
 
05:56:50.750 --> 05:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
actually recognizes recognize additional
 
05:56:53.510 --> 05:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
costs so you know extenuating needs
 
05:56:56.390 --> 05:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
associated with special education so
 
05:57:00.110 --> 05:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
these are all part of a a package of
 
05:57:02.690 --> 05:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
bills that uh that are designed to move
 
05:57:05.628 --> 05:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
us all move New Hampshire in the right
 
05:57:08.570 --> 05:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
direction when it comes to Equitable
 
05:57:11.628 --> 05:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
school funding so now I just want to
 
05:57:16.310 --> 05:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
swing over to um House Bill 709 which uh
 
05:57:18.650 --> 05:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
which the chair had had referenced
 
05:57:22.250 --> 05:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
earlier uh this was something that we
 
05:57:25.628 --> 05:57:25.638 align:start position:0%
worked on collaboratively back in 2019
 
05:57:30.410 --> 05:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh the bill was filed and Mark was in
 
05:57:32.750 --> 05:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
the LBA across the street yeah yeah we
 
05:57:35.448 --> 05:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
worked with with with uh with Nikki on
 
05:57:38.628 --> 05:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
and Mark and Mickey on on that and they
 
05:57:42.230 --> 05:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
put together miles and miles of uh of
 
05:57:44.690 --> 05:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets for us as we're trying out
 
05:57:47.690 --> 05:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
different um different scenarios but uh
 
05:57:49.788 --> 05:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
but we came up with uh with a scenario
 
05:57:52.430 --> 05:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
very similar to this the splits are
 
05:57:55.310 --> 05:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
about about the same the um
 
05:57:58.430 --> 05:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
the um the starting point and end point
 
05:58:01.070 --> 05:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
have been updated so I think back then
 
05:58:05.208 --> 05:58:05.218 align:start position:0%
it was like 350 000 was low equalized
 
05:58:07.490 --> 05:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
value per pupil going to 1.1 million
 
05:58:09.470 --> 05:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
dollars was the high equalized property
 
05:58:12.530 --> 05:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
value per pupil that has shifted to six
 
05:58:15.250 --> 05:58:15.260 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars at the low and
 
05:58:18.530 --> 05:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
1.6 million at the high so that
 
05:58:21.590 --> 05:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
represents current equalized uh Mark you
 
05:58:23.868 --> 05:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
know change in market value over the
 
05:58:27.048 --> 05:58:27.058 align:start position:0%
last uh four years and the 1.6 is
 
05:58:30.350 --> 05:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
actually the average equalized valuation
 
05:58:32.868 --> 05:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
um uh in the state and so it provides
 
05:58:34.970 --> 05:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
that 80 million dollars to support
 
05:58:38.090 --> 05:58:38.100 align:start position:0%
districts on a sliding scale uh that
 
05:58:40.250 --> 05:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
have lower than average uh equalized
 
05:58:41.868 --> 05:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
property values because they can't they
 
05:58:44.390 --> 05:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
can't generate the local property tax
 
05:58:46.610 --> 05:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
revenue to fund their schools some are
 
05:58:49.310 --> 05:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
working super hard like like
 
05:58:51.350 --> 05:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
um like well I only just pick one like
 
05:58:52.970 --> 05:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton all right because I know it
 
05:58:55.670 --> 05:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
really well and and we spent and
 
05:58:57.770 --> 05:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
something close to thirty dollars per
 
05:59:00.288 --> 05:59:00.298 align:start position:0%
thousand on our schools
 
05:59:03.650 --> 05:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
um and on our tax rate which is a really
 
05:59:03.660 --> 05:59:04.788 align:start position:0%
um and on our tax rate which is a really
high

05:59:04.788 --> 05:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
high
 
05:59:06.048 --> 05:59:06.058 align:start position:0%
um School tax rate New Hampshire
 
05:59:08.448 --> 05:59:08.458 align:start position:0%
haverhill's right up there uh with it
 
05:59:10.970 --> 05:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
too I think pretty close to that
 
05:59:14.448 --> 05:59:14.458 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I'll look it up yeah and uh
 
05:59:16.330 --> 05:59:16.340 align:start position:0%
but uh but but
 
05:59:18.770 --> 05:59:18.780 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton student outcomes are also
 
05:59:20.990 --> 05:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
among the best in the state and we're
 
05:59:22.970 --> 05:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
working hard and we're getting results
 
05:59:25.788 --> 05:59:25.798 align:start position:0%
but we only have to go 20 minutes up the
 
05:59:27.230 --> 05:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
road to Newport
 
05:59:29.868 --> 05:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
they're working super hard I think their
 
05:59:32.990 --> 05:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
school tax rate is almost forty dollars
 
05:59:36.288 --> 05:59:36.298 align:start position:0%
35 or 40 dollars per thousand and even
 
05:59:39.830 --> 05:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
at that they can't generate a um a
 
05:59:42.288 --> 05:59:42.298 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh amount of local tax Rec
 
05:59:46.670 --> 05:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue to fund a a school budget and um
 
05:59:48.770 --> 05:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
and you know I I always throw Manchester
 
05:59:51.470 --> 05:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
under the bus on on here but actually
 
05:59:53.868 --> 05:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
Newport has the lowest performing
 
05:59:55.910 --> 05:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
students in the state
 
05:59:59.390 --> 05:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
highest taxes lowest performing that's
 
06:00:03.110 --> 06:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
where House Bill 529 comes in and really
 
06:00:05.570 --> 06:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
delivers some cash to provide some tax
 
06:00:08.690 --> 06:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
relief uh to Newport but also some
 
06:00:10.548 --> 06:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
Revenue to Newport that they can put
 
06:00:12.590 --> 06:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
towards their budget not every not every
 
06:00:15.410 --> 06:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
school district's going to need need you
 
06:00:17.208 --> 06:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
know you can use it for tax relief you
 
06:00:19.368 --> 06:00:19.378 align:start position:0%
can use it for Revenue but it helps to
 
06:00:22.010 --> 06:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
write the ship for these um for these
 
06:00:22.020 --> 06:00:23.208 align:start position:0%
write the ship for these um for these
districts

06:00:23.208 --> 06:00:23.218 align:start position:0%
districts
 
06:00:25.490 --> 06:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 709
 
06:00:29.390 --> 06:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
all right it uh it uh it passed this
 
06:00:29.400 --> 06:00:31.010 align:start position:0%
all right it uh it uh it passed this
committee

06:00:31.010 --> 06:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
do I have to vote on here
 
06:00:36.470 --> 06:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
past this committee
 
06:00:41.810 --> 06:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:45.830 --> 06:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
there was um two floor amendments
 
06:00:47.930 --> 06:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
a committee Amendment and then the Luna
 
06:00:49.670 --> 06:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
loud amendment that I think was probably
 
06:00:51.410 --> 06:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
some housekeeping in that in that bill
 
06:00:54.350 --> 06:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
that both passed with a Voice vote
 
06:00:58.090 --> 06:00:58.100 align:start position:0%
and then on February 27 2019
 
06:01:01.548 --> 06:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
the bill is amended past the floor of
 
06:01:05.390 --> 06:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
the house on a roll call vote of 262 to
 
06:01:05.400 --> 06:01:08.090 align:start position:0%
the house on a roll call vote of 262 to
82.

06:01:08.090 --> 06:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
82.
 
06:01:11.090 --> 06:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
so pretty strong by it was one of the
 
06:01:13.788 --> 06:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
strongest bipartisan votes uh I think we
 
06:01:16.010 --> 06:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
had in that in that session and I think
 
06:01:18.530 --> 06:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
that speaks to the
 
06:01:20.510 --> 06:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
06:01:24.948 --> 06:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
Hospital 709 and now House Bill 529
 
06:01:28.490 --> 06:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
um really do meet the needs of most of
 
06:01:31.010 --> 06:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
of our constituents
 
06:01:33.590 --> 06:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
um uh across the state
 
06:01:33.600 --> 06:01:34.490 align:start position:0%
um uh across the state
um

06:01:34.490 --> 06:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:36.890 --> 06:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
so it's um
 
06:01:38.930 --> 06:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
what was the problem with household 709
 
06:01:40.548 --> 06:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
why aren't we just living the dream and
 
06:01:44.330 --> 06:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
and uh going with that because
 
06:01:46.730 --> 06:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
um what what ended up happening and what
 
06:01:49.910 --> 06:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
what may happen with this bill too
 
06:01:53.270 --> 06:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
um is uh is if it passes here and passes
 
06:01:55.490 --> 06:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
the floor and goes to finance Finance
 
06:01:56.930 --> 06:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
can take a look at putting it in the
 
06:01:59.628 --> 06:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
state budget and uh and the wording in
 
06:02:02.150 --> 06:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
the state budget uh during that year was
 
06:02:04.010 --> 06:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
that it was only going to last for one
 
06:02:07.190 --> 06:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
year so it was only in the FY 21 budget
 
06:02:10.850 --> 06:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
so so the grants that came out of out of
 
06:02:14.690 --> 06:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
out of household 709 which came came to
 
06:02:17.390 --> 06:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the 62 to 65 million dollar
 
06:02:21.610 --> 06:02:21.620 align:start position:0%
range total lasted only one year for the
 
06:02:25.850 --> 06:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
2020-2021 school year fiscal year 21.
 
06:02:29.090 --> 06:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
um and uh and that was a problem
 
06:02:30.650 --> 06:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
um uh we heard about it from mayor Craig
 
06:02:33.110 --> 06:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
actually because um what what cities
 
06:02:35.090 --> 06:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
like Manchester need is sustainable
 
06:02:37.190 --> 06:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue Source from the state a
 
06:02:39.410 --> 06:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
predictable State funding stream again
 
06:02:41.448 --> 06:02:41.458 align:start position:0%
comprehensive school funding reform but
 
06:02:43.970 --> 06:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
even something like this if it can go in
 
06:02:47.810 --> 06:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
as a multi-year plan than than at least
 
06:02:50.930 --> 06:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
cities and towns can know what's coming
 
06:02:53.090 --> 06:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
at them and can form their budgets and
 
06:02:55.910 --> 06:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
have a predicted and and a sustainable
 
06:02:58.250 --> 06:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
solution uh and that's what house bill
 
06:03:02.448 --> 06:03:02.458 align:start position:0%
529 uh does but most importantly and
 
06:03:04.070 --> 06:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
this is the part I don't want anybody to
 
06:03:05.930 --> 06:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
forget I'm sorry I'm spending so much
 
06:03:07.368 --> 06:03:07.378 align:start position:0%
time on this
 
06:03:10.490 --> 06:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
um is that it uses the same amount of
 
06:03:15.310 --> 06:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
money that's in the current FY 23
 
06:03:18.230 --> 06:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
education trust fund for supporting
 
06:03:20.750 --> 06:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
Public Schools doesn't use any more
 
06:03:23.208 --> 06:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
use the same amount of money that we're
 
06:03:24.890 --> 06:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
currently using out of the education
 
06:03:27.530 --> 06:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
trust fund so
 
06:03:29.868 --> 06:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
um I guess in conclusion
 
06:03:31.910 --> 06:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Belcher has
 
06:03:34.430 --> 06:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned that a couple times we've got
 
06:03:35.930 --> 06:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
um we've we've we've got a lot of stuff
 
06:03:38.150 --> 06:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
in the rear review window Claremont
 
06:03:40.250 --> 06:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
Claremont one Claremont to Londonderry
 
06:03:42.770 --> 06:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
we've got conval in front of us right
 
06:03:48.650 --> 06:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
now we've got the Rand case pending and
 
06:03:53.030 --> 06:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
passing House Bill 529 I think would be
 
06:03:56.448 --> 06:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
a strong sign to the courts that the
 
06:03:59.750 --> 06:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
legislature can get something done uh in
 
06:04:01.850 --> 06:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
school funding it's not perfect it's not
 
06:04:04.190 --> 06:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
comprehensive it's a light touch but
 
06:04:06.048 --> 06:04:06.058 align:start position:0%
that we take it seriously and we take
 
06:04:10.510 --> 06:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
this job seriously and um and and I hope
 
06:04:14.330 --> 06:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
that the courts will uh will con will
 
06:04:18.410 --> 06:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
will allow the legislature to um to to
 
06:04:20.330 --> 06:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
do what it's supposed to do Define
 
06:04:23.690 --> 06:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
adequacy cost it out and then make sure
 
06:04:25.250 --> 06:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
that every district has the access to
 
06:04:27.830 --> 06:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
the resources they need because if they
 
06:04:30.770 --> 06:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
don't where I I don't know what's going
 
06:04:34.850 --> 06:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
to happen so I think 529 is a is a shine
 
06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
as a sign of good faith effort that that
 
06:04:41.330 --> 06:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
we can live up to our obligations to so
 
06:04:43.730 --> 06:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
with that I'll wrap up and happy to take
 
06:04:45.530 --> 06:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
any questions on any of this stuff other
 
06:04:48.230 --> 06:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
questions yes reptek has guided thank
 
06:04:50.208 --> 06:04:50.218 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you representative
 
06:04:53.090 --> 06:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
lulo uh luno just a question of
 
06:04:55.128 --> 06:04:55.138 align:start position:0%
technicality would say if this were
 
06:04:57.230 --> 06:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
passed it would only take effect July 1
 
06:04:59.570 --> 06:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
2024 is there any rationale why it
 
06:05:02.990 --> 06:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take effect July 1 2023 sure
 
06:05:05.090 --> 06:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the thank you for the
 
06:05:05.100 --> 06:05:06.048 align:start position:0%
thank you for the thank you for the
question

06:05:06.048 --> 06:05:06.058 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:05:10.010 --> 06:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
um uh yeah because the school budgets
 
06:05:11.750 --> 06:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
and budget committees are already
 
06:05:14.048 --> 06:05:14.058 align:start position:0%
working on their their their their their
 
06:05:19.610 --> 06:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh their FY 24 budgets and um and you
 
06:05:19.620 --> 06:05:21.650 align:start position:0%
uh their FY 24 budgets and um and you
know

06:05:21.650 --> 06:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:05:24.190 --> 06:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
and it's going to take a while
 
06:05:26.690 --> 06:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass and get everywhere
 
06:05:29.208 --> 06:05:29.218 align:start position:0%
it needs and everything uh it's not
 
06:05:31.430 --> 06:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to be on on anybody it's not going
 
06:05:33.048 --> 06:05:33.058 align:start position:0%
to be on the governor's desk until the
 
06:05:37.010 --> 06:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
end of June so um so so fy25 becomes a
 
06:05:37.020 --> 06:05:38.150 align:start position:0%
end of June so um so so fy25 becomes a
practical

06:05:38.150 --> 06:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
practical
 
06:05:40.190 --> 06:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
um a practical thing
 
06:05:42.410 --> 06:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:05:44.810 --> 06:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative leckis
 
06:05:46.850 --> 06:05:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
06:05:46.860 --> 06:05:47.690 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

06:05:47.690 --> 06:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:05:50.990 --> 06:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
I remember that subcommittee and and
 
06:05:53.990 --> 06:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I thought we came out with some
 
06:05:56.930 --> 06:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
some good ideas out of that and one of
 
06:05:59.270 --> 06:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
the things I'm wondering one of the
 
06:06:01.810 --> 06:06:01.820 align:start position:0%
things we did is this
 
06:06:04.850 --> 06:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
529 has those
 
06:06:08.090 --> 06:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
water you know Cliffs that you fall over
 
06:06:09.890 --> 06:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
between here and here you get this
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
between here and here you get this Etc
 
06:06:13.850 --> 06:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
and one of the things we did was we made
 
06:06:16.250 --> 06:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
a linear function instead of a step
 
06:06:19.128 --> 06:06:19.138 align:start position:0%
function and we got help from the
 
06:06:22.430 --> 06:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
numbers people who said yeah no problem
 
06:06:24.230 --> 06:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
so that was one of the things I thought
 
06:06:27.230 --> 06:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
was particularly good about 709 and I'm
 
06:06:29.510 --> 06:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
wondering why that wasn't done then in
 
06:06:32.690 --> 06:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
529 yeah so so thanks I'm not sure we
 
06:06:35.390 --> 06:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
actually did that in 709
 
06:06:35.400 --> 06:06:36.350 align:start position:0%
actually did that in 709
um

06:06:36.350 --> 06:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:38.628 --> 06:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
um I I know exactly what you're talking
 
06:06:41.030 --> 06:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
about and and we actually did it in
 
06:06:44.270 --> 06:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1680 last year we had a we
 
06:06:46.070 --> 06:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
had a smoothing function particularly
 
06:06:48.590 --> 06:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
for the free introduced price lunch
 
06:06:52.128 --> 06:06:52.138 align:start position:0%
um uh grants this one does have a smooth
 
06:06:54.410 --> 06:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
function on the fiscal capacity
 
06:06:56.150 --> 06:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid the larger of the two
 
06:06:58.610 --> 06:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
grants the 80 million dollars that's a
 
06:07:00.890 --> 06:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
that's a fraction of a penny per dollar
 
06:07:04.788 --> 06:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
for every um every student in the ADM so
 
06:07:08.810 --> 06:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
so that has a a absolutely smooth
 
06:07:11.890 --> 06:07:11.900 align:start position:0%
um um Landing path between
 
06:07:15.170 --> 06:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
districts with a valuation of six
 
06:07:17.150 --> 06:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars per pupil and
 
06:07:19.310 --> 06:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
1.6 million dollars per people it's
 
06:07:21.948 --> 06:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
completely linear uh on that but but
 
06:07:23.570 --> 06:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:07:24.890 --> 06:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
um representative Lucas for bringing
 
06:07:27.350 --> 06:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
that up because I think we're we're you
 
06:07:29.570 --> 06:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
know as as representative fellow said uh
 
06:07:31.010 --> 06:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
we've got some we've got some
 
06:07:33.110 --> 06:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
housekeeping a housekeeping Amendment
 
06:07:35.390 --> 06:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
anyway let's take a look at doing that
 
06:07:37.070 --> 06:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
for the free and reduced price lunch I
 
06:07:39.350 --> 06:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
love that idea thank you thank you yes
 
06:07:42.048 --> 06:07:42.058 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced as you remember
 
06:07:46.490 --> 06:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
back in 2008 nine thereabouts when we
 
06:07:49.250 --> 06:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
we got into the report of establishing
 
06:07:51.650 --> 06:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
adequacy then we had the waterfall
 
06:07:53.930 --> 06:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
effect you go from this bracket uh free
 
06:07:56.030 --> 06:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
and reduced to this bracket and each
 
06:07:58.430 --> 06:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
there was no slide it was just you
 
06:08:00.470 --> 06:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
dropped off so if you went from let's
 
06:08:03.530 --> 06:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
say I'll just grab a number from 20 to
 
06:08:06.410 --> 06:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
19 if you're at the Costco one you took
 
06:08:09.708 --> 06:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
a real drop in one year of what kind of
 
06:08:12.110 --> 06:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue we're going to get and and that
 
06:08:14.570 --> 06:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
was not really a sustainable picture at
 
06:08:17.150 --> 06:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
all for school districts to plan
 
06:08:19.070 --> 06:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
based upon the number of kids that came
 
06:08:20.750 --> 06:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
in free and reduced each year it might
 
06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
flip-flop on them and there they are
 
06:08:23.868 --> 06:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
they're losing thousands of dollars yeah
 
06:08:25.730 --> 06:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
yeah no I think that's a great it's a
 
06:08:27.948 --> 06:08:27.958 align:start position:0%
great suggestion for for this I think
 
06:08:29.510 --> 06:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
we'll move in that direction well that
 
06:08:31.070 --> 06:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
was the concept came out of the 2018
 
06:08:33.708 --> 06:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
report too as you just have this slide
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
06:08:37.610 --> 06:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative woodcock
 
06:08:39.650 --> 06:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
thanks chairman it was a little thank
 
06:08:41.628 --> 06:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
you for taking my two questions one far
 
06:08:43.490 --> 06:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
one question two Posse
 
06:08:47.570 --> 06:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
um how many communities will this impact
 
06:08:53.650 --> 06:08:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:57.170 --> 06:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna say at least over half
 
06:08:59.628 --> 06:08:59.638 align:start position:0%
um uh probably probably much more than
 
06:09:01.190 --> 06:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
that probably more like two-thirds or
 
06:09:04.430 --> 06:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
three quarters uh uh but uh but
 
06:09:08.690 --> 06:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
everybody has a uh yeah yeah so but that
 
06:09:12.288 --> 06:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
but yes may follow up yes thank you and
 
06:09:14.750 --> 06:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know babe is this going to be annual
 
06:09:16.610 --> 06:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
is this going to be embedded in for Left
 
06:09:18.830 --> 06:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
for a good so
 
06:09:20.628 --> 06:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
um the way the language is written in
 
06:09:23.090 --> 06:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
529 it would be there until it's
 
06:09:24.890 --> 06:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
repealed or changed
 
06:09:28.010 --> 06:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
um but um but as we know this isn't the
 
06:09:29.990 --> 06:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
last stop sure first and last stop for
 
06:09:32.510 --> 06:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
this bill and um but the intent is
 
06:09:34.910 --> 06:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
ongoing yes okay thank you thank you Mr
 
06:09:37.250 --> 06:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
chairman but this remember is not part
 
06:09:40.070 --> 06:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the adequacy right and that's that's
 
06:09:42.110 --> 06:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
the issue because everything there forth
 
06:09:45.288 --> 06:09:45.298 align:start position:0%
is a grant okay and grants get changed
 
06:09:47.510 --> 06:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
just just like the the extraordinary
 
06:09:51.368 --> 06:09:51.378 align:start position:0%
needs Grant is is there right now yeah
 
06:09:54.350 --> 06:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
but but but but the bill that you're
 
06:09:54.360 --> 06:09:55.690 align:start position:0%
but but but but the bill that you're
sponsoring

06:09:55.690 --> 06:09:55.700 align:start position:0%
sponsoring
 
06:09:59.690 --> 06:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
540 that actually is an adequacy that's
 
06:10:02.330 --> 06:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's different than this but
 
06:10:05.208 --> 06:10:05.218 align:start position:0%
it taken together its school funding yes
 
06:10:07.570 --> 06:10:07.580 align:start position:0%
yes thank you both
 
06:10:10.250 --> 06:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh further questions we have a few more
 
06:10:13.128 --> 06:10:13.138 align:start position:0%
cards on 529 here
 
06:10:15.890 --> 06:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
they come in order here there
 
06:10:18.770 --> 06:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
is 309
 
06:10:33.470 --> 06:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:35.628 --> 06:10:35.638 align:start position:0%
hello again uh for the record my name is
 
06:10:37.250 --> 06:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
Zach Sheehan I'm the Project Director of
 
06:10:38.810 --> 06:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school funding
 
06:10:41.690 --> 06:10:41.700 align:start position:0%
fairness project uh we are in support of
 
06:10:44.140 --> 06:10:44.150 align:start position:0%
House Bill 529
 
06:10:44.150 --> 06:10:44.990 align:start position:0%
House Bill 529
[Music]

06:10:44.990 --> 06:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:10:45.000 --> 06:10:45.910 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

06:10:45.910 --> 06:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:48.530 --> 06:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
largely uh the reason being that does
 
06:10:50.868 --> 06:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
touch upon two of the main inequities in
 
06:10:52.850 --> 06:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
our school funding system those of the
 
06:10:55.010 --> 06:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
funds being distributed to schools and
 
06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
who pays for them
 
06:10:57.120 --> 06:10:57.948 align:start position:0%
who pays for them
um

06:10:57.948 --> 06:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:00.110 --> 06:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
in support 529 because it does consider
 
06:11:02.208 --> 06:11:02.218 align:start position:0%
the varying abilities of communities to
 
06:11:04.190 --> 06:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
raise sufficient funds for the public
 
06:11:05.770 --> 06:11:05.780 align:start position:0%
schools in this system
 
06:11:08.090 --> 06:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
Additionally the proportion of students
 
06:11:09.830 --> 06:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
in any given District to qualify for
 
06:11:11.868 --> 06:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price meals is an
 
06:11:13.190 --> 06:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
important equity-minded approach to
 
06:11:14.810 --> 06:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
increasing aid for schools that need it
 
06:11:16.970 --> 06:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
most and by combining these two
 
06:11:19.010 --> 06:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
additional Aid calculations House Bill
 
06:11:21.410 --> 06:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
529 acknowledges that communities can
 
06:11:23.690 --> 06:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
have on average higher property values
 
06:11:25.490 --> 06:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
and still have students different
 
06:11:27.770 --> 06:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
proportions of students that might have
 
06:11:30.948 --> 06:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
different needs as measured by amount of
 
06:11:34.788 --> 06:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
free reduced price lunch students
 
06:11:36.230 --> 06:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
um but such communities do have are
 
06:11:37.910 --> 06:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
forced to rely so heavily on local
 
06:11:40.910 --> 06:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
property taxes to fund our schools the
 
06:11:42.650 --> 06:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
equalized value for people is a good
 
06:11:44.750 --> 06:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
measure the community's relative fiscal
 
06:11:47.208 --> 06:11:47.218 align:start position:0%
capacity to support their schools and
 
06:11:49.788 --> 06:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
add Aid waited to consider that capacity
 
06:11:52.190 --> 06:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
is critical to help schools that need it
 
06:11:52.200 --> 06:11:53.150 align:start position:0%
is critical to help schools that need it
most

06:11:53.150 --> 06:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
most
 
06:11:55.070 --> 06:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
um and I do have some testimony passing
 
06:11:56.570 --> 06:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
around but just pulled out a few
 
06:11:56.580 --> 06:11:57.708 align:start position:0%
around but just pulled out a few
examples

06:11:57.708 --> 06:11:57.718 align:start position:0%
examples
 
06:12:00.288 --> 06:12:00.298 align:start position:0%
um for folks specifically so if you look
 
06:12:03.288 --> 06:12:03.298 align:start position:0%
at two two towns um
 
06:12:05.208 --> 06:12:05.218 align:start position:0%
Milford and Portsmouth for example they
 
06:12:08.208 --> 06:12:08.218 align:start position:0%
have similar student populations Milford
 
06:12:09.770 --> 06:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
has an equalized value for people of
 
06:12:11.930 --> 06:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
just over a million dollars in any
 
06:12:13.610 --> 06:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
classical tax rate of about fourteen
 
06:12:16.368 --> 06:12:16.378 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars fourteen dollars per
 
06:12:17.990 --> 06:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
thousand which raises about fourteen
 
06:12:19.730 --> 06:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per student but
 
06:12:21.650 --> 06:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth on the other hand has the
 
06:12:24.110 --> 06:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
acquires value for people of um four
 
06:12:26.390 --> 06:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
times that about four million dollars an
 
06:12:28.368 --> 06:12:28.378 align:start position:0%
equalized School tax rate about five
 
06:12:30.470 --> 06:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand and if they raise
 
06:12:31.910 --> 06:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
twenty one thousand dollars per student
 
06:12:34.010 --> 06:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
so while the people in Milford pay
 
06:12:35.750 --> 06:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
almost three times the school property
 
06:12:38.810 --> 06:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
tax rate than those in Portsmouth
 
06:12:40.670 --> 06:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
they raised six thousand dollars less
 
06:12:42.650 --> 06:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
per student due to the dramatic
 
06:12:44.690 --> 06:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
differences in their average property
 
06:12:47.150 --> 06:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
values and that's just one example
 
06:12:48.470 --> 06:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
um you can see that all throughout the
 
06:12:50.750 --> 06:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
state and so I think that taking
 
06:12:52.548 --> 06:12:52.558 align:start position:0%
equalized value for pupil is House Bill
 
06:12:56.810 --> 06:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
529 does into account as the community's
 
06:12:58.548 --> 06:12:58.558 align:start position:0%
different communities relative fiscal
 
06:13:02.150 --> 06:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
ability to raise funds uh since about 70
 
06:13:03.890 --> 06:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
percent of all School District revenue
 
06:13:07.010 --> 06:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
does come from local property taxes this
 
06:13:09.530 --> 06:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
is a good step in the right direction
 
06:13:11.448 --> 06:13:11.458 align:start position:0%
um to making our school funding system
 
06:13:13.610 --> 06:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
more Equitable I'll be happy to help
 
06:13:15.590 --> 06:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
respond to the disability committee if
 
06:13:17.628 --> 06:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
you have any suggestions or proposed
 
06:13:19.070 --> 06:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
changes or anything and I'd be happy to
 
06:13:20.990 --> 06:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you for the
 
06:13:21.000 --> 06:13:23.150 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you for the
questions

06:13:23.150 --> 06:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:13:26.330 --> 06:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
now seeing thank you very much

06:13:36.480 --> 06:13:38.390 align:start position:0%
B I'm thinking I know I'm just trying to
think

06:13:38.390 --> 06:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:13:39.948 --> 06:13:39.958 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
06:13:43.788 --> 06:13:43.798 align:start position:0%

thank you that's quite all right
 
06:13:57.170 --> 06:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd it's always a pleasure to
 
06:13:59.330 --> 06:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
see you it seems like I see you every
 
06:14:01.628 --> 06:14:01.638 align:start position:0%
two years yes
 
06:14:04.310 --> 06:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
I got a prepared statement that I have
 
06:14:06.110 --> 06:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
one going around for all the committee
 
06:14:06.120 --> 06:14:07.010 align:start position:0%
one going around for all the committee
members

06:14:07.010 --> 06:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
members
 
06:14:09.708 --> 06:14:09.718 align:start position:0%
uh dear Chapman lad and members of the
 
06:14:12.470 --> 06:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
House Education committee uh my name is
 
06:14:15.230 --> 06:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
Paul Grenier and I am currently serving
 
06:14:17.990 --> 06:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
in my 14th consecutive year as mayor of
 
06:14:19.430 --> 06:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
the city of Berlin
 
06:14:21.288 --> 06:14:21.298 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for your work in
 
06:14:23.448 --> 06:14:23.458 align:start position:0%
serving our great state in times that
 
06:14:26.150 --> 06:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
are both very challenging but also quite
 
06:14:28.970 --> 06:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
rewarding I'm in front of you today to
 
06:14:31.548 --> 06:14:31.558 align:start position:0%
ask all of you to support
 
06:14:36.048 --> 06:14:36.058 align:start position:0%
House Bill 529 as I read the text of the
 
06:14:38.868 --> 06:14:38.878 align:start position:0%
bill it is clear that the intent of the
 
06:14:40.850 --> 06:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
bill is to Target additional State
 
06:14:44.270 --> 06:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
education Aid that to communities that
 
06:14:45.948 --> 06:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
have a disproportionate number of
 
06:14:47.868 --> 06:14:47.878 align:start position:0%
students in public schools that come
 
06:14:50.628 --> 06:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
from economically struggling families
 
06:14:54.350 --> 06:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
the rapidly skyrocketing cost of housing
 
06:14:56.628 --> 06:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
in our state even in Berlin
 
06:14:59.510 --> 06:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
has created a dynamic where even working
 
06:15:02.750 --> 06:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
families at once could get by now find
 
06:15:04.670 --> 06:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
themselves struggling week to week just
 
06:15:06.410 --> 06:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
to feed their families
 
06:15:09.830 --> 06:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
in Berlin as of the October 2022
 
06:15:12.830 --> 06:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Education report a
 
06:15:15.948 --> 06:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
fraction of over 46 percent of our total
 
06:15:17.990 --> 06:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
student population
 
06:15:21.470 --> 06:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
qualify for free and reduced lunch
 
06:15:23.930 --> 06:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
those are the faces of kids that are the
 
06:15:27.530 --> 06:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
future of our region State and Workforce
 
06:15:30.288 --> 06:15:30.298 align:start position:0%
just as important however is this burden
 
06:15:33.170 --> 06:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
creates a huge backlash for our already
 
06:15:35.350 --> 06:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
stretched taxpayers in Berlin
 
06:15:38.448 --> 06:15:38.458 align:start position:0%
high-paying jobs are not the norm and
 
06:15:40.490 --> 06:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
many residents who own their homes are
 
06:15:40.500 --> 06:15:41.628 align:start position:0%
many residents who own their homes are
retired

06:15:41.628 --> 06:15:41.638 align:start position:0%
retired
 
06:15:43.788 --> 06:15:43.798 align:start position:0%
Berlin's local school funding debates
 
06:15:47.090 --> 06:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
don't Center on new athletic fields or
 
06:15:49.430 --> 06:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
new intramural intramural activities
 
06:15:51.650 --> 06:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
which we all know are Out Of Reach
 
06:15:54.230 --> 06:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
it comes down fairly quickly to how much
 
06:15:55.548 --> 06:15:55.558 align:start position:0%
we can afford
 
06:15:58.310 --> 06:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
with limited local resources many kids
 
06:16:01.010 --> 06:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
who struggle badly wind up being left
 
06:16:01.020 --> 06:16:01.788 align:start position:0%
who struggle badly wind up being left
out

06:16:01.788 --> 06:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:16:04.910 --> 06:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
in addition gifted kids who need to be
 
06:16:06.830 --> 06:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
challenged often don't get the proper
 
06:16:10.368 --> 06:16:10.378 align:start position:0%
attention they truly deserve
 
06:16:13.910 --> 06:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 529 though not perfect at
 
06:16:15.650 --> 06:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
least attempts to address the inequities
 
06:16:18.410 --> 06:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
that have long been identified by our
 
06:16:19.610 --> 06:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
court system
 
06:16:21.890 --> 06:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
I would suggest however that the bill be
 
06:16:24.288 --> 06:16:24.298 align:start position:0%
amended to raise equalized valuation per
 
06:16:28.128 --> 06:16:28.138 align:start position:0%
admr to read 850 000 or less
 
06:16:30.470 --> 06:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
you may find that there are no school
 
06:16:32.570 --> 06:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
districts who follow that category with
 
06:16:34.610 --> 06:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
the current proposed language
 
06:16:37.128 --> 06:16:37.138 align:start position:0%
in closing along for the day I no longer
 
06:16:38.930 --> 06:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
have to testify in education related
 
06:16:38.940 --> 06:16:40.128 align:start position:0%
have to testify in education related
bills

06:16:40.128 --> 06:16:40.138 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:16:42.590 --> 06:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
Berlin is climbing out of the depot we
 
06:16:46.310 --> 06:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
found ourselves in to be in 16 years ago
 
06:16:48.650 --> 06:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
I also plead with all of you to find a
 
06:16:50.708 --> 06:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
permanent solution to funding education
 
06:16:53.390 --> 06:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
that removes The Cloud of uncertainty
 
06:16:55.730 --> 06:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
school districts and municipalities face
 
06:16:57.650 --> 06:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
every two years
 
06:16:59.628 --> 06:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
most importantly
 
06:17:02.090 --> 06:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
find a solution before the New Hampshire
 
06:17:05.690 --> 06:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
courts impose one on all of us
 
06:17:08.510 --> 06:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
that is not the New Hampshire way
 
06:17:10.548 --> 06:17:10.558 align:start position:0%
glad to take questions thank you very
 
06:17:13.368 --> 06:17:13.378 align:start position:0%

06:17:24.770 --> 06:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
you mentioned 850 000 is that we're
 
06:17:27.530 --> 06:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
going to start with this why I think the
 
06:17:31.610 --> 06:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
bill says 600 000 and work and the the
 
06:17:35.628 --> 06:17:35.638 align:start position:0%
the the top one point the poorest number
 
06:17:39.770 --> 06:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
is 600 000 in reviewing uh Brolin's
 
06:17:41.990 --> 06:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
figures right now with our new
 
06:17:42.000 --> 06:17:43.548 align:start position:0%
figures right now with our new
reevaluation

06:17:43.548 --> 06:17:43.558 align:start position:0%
reevaluation
 
06:17:47.150 --> 06:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
our our net value per student is around
 
06:17:47.160 --> 06:17:48.948 align:start position:0%
our our net value per student is around
770

06:17:48.948 --> 06:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
770
 
06:17:50.390 --> 06:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
000 dollars
 
06:17:53.390 --> 06:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
but that's counting uh electrical
 
06:17:55.310 --> 06:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
generating assets within the city of
 
06:17:57.890 --> 06:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
Maryland's attacks and as we all know
 
06:18:00.530 --> 06:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
generating assets don't pay local school
 
06:18:05.030 --> 06:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
tax they pay the state uh School tax so
 
06:18:07.310 --> 06:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
if you take 25 percent of Maryland's
 
06:18:09.948 --> 06:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
taxable valuation now we're down to
 
06:18:14.330 --> 06:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
about 510 520 000 per student
 
06:18:17.350 --> 06:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
herein lies one of the larger inequities
 
06:18:21.350 --> 06:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
of the law and totality
 
06:18:25.548 --> 06:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further further questions

education legislation committee today
 
06:18:52.490 --> 06:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking on behalf of the Manchester
 
06:18:55.070 --> 06:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
School Board which has authorized me to
 
06:18:56.690 --> 06:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
advocate for additional support to
 
06:18:58.850 --> 06:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
individual schools and districts with
 
06:19:00.350 --> 06:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
higher proportions of students in
 
06:19:02.570 --> 06:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
poverty English language Learners and
 
06:19:04.128 --> 06:19:04.138 align:start position:0%

services
 
06:19:07.730 --> 06:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
we are therefore unanimous in our
 
06:19:10.010 --> 06:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
support of the targeted funding proposed
 
06:19:15.110 --> 06:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
in HB 529 as of December 31st 2022 our
 
06:19:17.030 --> 06:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
applications for free or reduced price
 
06:19:20.270 --> 06:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
meals make 51.18 of our students
 
06:19:20.280 --> 06:19:22.490 align:start position:0%
meals make 51.18 of our students
eligible

06:19:22.490 --> 06:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
06:19:24.048 --> 06:19:24.058 align:start position:0%
in addition to being chronically
 
06:19:26.570 --> 06:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
underfunded our district our district
 
06:19:28.610 --> 06:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
projects food costs to increase
 
06:19:31.250 --> 06:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
significantly due to shortages in food
 
06:19:33.708 --> 06:19:33.718 align:start position:0%
and supplies bid prices that reflect
 
06:19:36.350 --> 06:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
inflation and Workforce shortages in
 
06:19:38.150 --> 06:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
schools and in the transportation of
 
06:19:40.970 --> 06:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
supplies I would also point out that in
 
06:19:42.288 --> 06:19:42.298 align:start position:0%
addition to being the largest school
 
06:19:44.510 --> 06:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
district in the state with 12 300
 
06:19:46.910 --> 06:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
students Manchester is also the most
 
06:19:48.890 --> 06:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
diverse District in the state with
 
06:19:50.390 --> 06:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
nearly half of our students being
 
06:19:50.400 --> 06:19:51.650 align:start position:0%
nearly half of our students being
non-white

06:19:51.650 --> 06:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
non-white
 
06:19:53.510 --> 06:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
many of our minority students come from
 
06:19:55.788 --> 06:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
the city's Refugee population and
 
06:19:58.490 --> 06:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
reflect a wide variety of cultures this
 
06:20:00.470 --> 06:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
demographic fact informs not only the
 
06:20:02.030 --> 06:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
importance of supporting these students
 
06:20:04.430 --> 06:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
with nutritious food but also with food
 
06:20:06.470 --> 06:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
choices that are sensitive to their
 
06:20:09.110 --> 06:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
religions and cultures offering these
 
06:20:11.448 --> 06:20:11.458 align:start position:0%
choices is often more expensive but we
 
06:20:13.190 --> 06:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
are committed to doing so because it is
 
06:20:15.010 --> 06:20:15.020 align:start position:0%
the right and respectful policy
 
06:20:17.330 --> 06:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
diversity is one of our great strengths
 
06:20:19.310 --> 06:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
and we want to support all of our
 
06:20:21.830 --> 06:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
students for these reasons the
 
06:20:23.750 --> 06:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
approximately 13 million dollars of
 
06:20:25.368 --> 06:20:25.378 align:start position:0%
additional State funding that this bill
 
06:20:28.010 --> 06:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
would provide is urgently needed and we
 
06:20:29.930 --> 06:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
ask for your support thank you for your
 
06:20:31.730 --> 06:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you very much are
 
06:20:33.110 --> 06:20:33.120 align:start position:0%

06:20:40.730 --> 06:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:43.368 --> 06:20:43.378 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair this is a lot better
 
06:29:04.530 --> 06:29:04.540 align:start position:0%
than talking about taxes
 
06:29:04.540 --> 06:29:07.810 align:start position:0%
than talking about taxes
[Laughter]

06:29:07.810 --> 06:29:07.820 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:29:11.868 --> 06:29:11.878 align:start position:0%

that uh regarding teaching civil rights
 
06:29:32.868 --> 06:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
education in schools there's a couple of
 
06:29:35.270 --> 06:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
programs McGraw-Hill which is one of the
 
06:29:38.030 --> 06:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
Publishers of this book which has been
 
06:29:40.490 --> 06:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
talking about the legacy of Martin
 
06:29:43.670 --> 06:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
Luther King Jr and what
 
06:29:45.650 --> 06:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
those of us of a certain age remember
 
06:29:49.310 --> 06:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
taking place quite vividly some in their
 
06:29:51.288 --> 06:29:51.298 align:start position:0%
own neighborhoods I grew up at that time
 
06:29:54.530 --> 06:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
in Elkhart Indiana and some of you may
 
06:29:56.810 --> 06:29:56.820 align:start position:0%
remember that a former president went to
 
06:30:00.110 --> 06:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
Elkhart because of its
 
06:30:03.170 --> 06:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
um problems it was having with uh race
 
06:30:07.190 --> 06:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:09.590 --> 06:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
I decided to sponsor this after seeing
 
06:30:13.070 --> 06:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
this at a couple of national conferences
 
06:30:15.708 --> 06:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
I have emailed to the committee several
 
06:30:19.430 --> 06:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
pieces of literature and something under
 
06:30:21.470 --> 06:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
the title of testimony and I'm hoping
 
06:30:23.690 --> 06:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
that representative lattice chair you
 
06:30:25.970 --> 06:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
went through those emails into the the
 
06:30:27.350 --> 06:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
public record
 
06:30:30.470 --> 06:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
I would greatly appreciate that
 
06:30:32.750 --> 06:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
those of us who have been around for
 
06:30:34.730 --> 06:30:34.740 align:start position:0%
more than one or two years remember what
 
06:30:37.548 --> 06:30:37.558 align:start position:0%
uh Martin Luther King said on the mall
 
06:30:41.628 --> 06:30:41.638 align:start position:0%
in front of uh the Lincoln Memorial
 
06:30:43.970 --> 06:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
about judging people according to their
 
06:30:43.980 --> 06:30:46.010 align:start position:0%
about judging people according to their
character

06:30:46.010 --> 06:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
character
 
06:30:47.930 --> 06:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to to try and come
 
06:30:50.628 --> 06:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
anywhere near his eloquence in speaking
 
06:30:52.430 --> 06:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
but he did mention New Hampshire
 
06:30:55.548 --> 06:30:55.558 align:start position:0%
specifically in that famous speech
 
06:30:57.708 --> 06:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
he's talking about from the hills the
 
06:30:59.570 --> 06:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
White Mountains of New Hampshire to the
 
06:31:01.570 --> 06:31:01.580 align:start position:0%
red clay of Georgia
 
06:31:04.010 --> 06:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
one thing we haven't done here in New
 
06:31:06.830 --> 06:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is actually addressed what he
 
06:31:10.610 --> 06:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
asked to teach people how to cooperate
 
06:31:12.590 --> 06:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
as one another yes he was a Christian
 
06:31:16.010 --> 06:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
pastor and that I believe is from where
 
06:31:19.750 --> 06:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
his philosophy our race relations came
 
06:31:22.610 --> 06:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
those of us who are Christians recall
 
06:31:24.470 --> 06:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
that we treat one another as we would
 
06:31:26.150 --> 06:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
like to be treated
 
06:31:28.670 --> 06:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
and that is what this legislation talks
 
06:31:31.490 --> 06:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
about in his famous speech
 
06:31:35.930 --> 06:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
Dr King also spoke about the fact that
 
06:31:38.868 --> 06:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
yeah things happened bad things happened
 
06:31:41.930 --> 06:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
but we can't dwell on the past we have
 
06:31:44.270 --> 06:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
to act for the future
 
06:31:47.030 --> 06:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
and we have to behave as though we're
 
06:31:48.890 --> 06:31:48.900 align:start position:0%
heading towards
 
06:31:50.750 --> 06:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
what he called the time when we can
 
06:31:54.590 --> 06:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
judge one another and for those reasons
 
06:31:57.530 --> 06:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
I've introduced this bill
 
06:31:59.810 --> 06:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
I will say that for the record I don't
 
06:32:01.788 --> 06:32:01.798 align:start position:0%
have any interest except maybe hidden in
 
06:32:03.770 --> 06:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
some mutual fund about which I have no
 
06:32:07.250 --> 06:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
idea uh you know with McGraw-Hill or any
 
06:32:09.288 --> 06:32:09.298 align:start position:0%
of their Publications I have become
 
06:32:11.030 --> 06:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
friendly with the primary sponsor
 
06:32:14.390 --> 06:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
Matthew Daniels of this uh who's pushing
 
06:32:17.208 --> 06:32:17.218 align:start position:0%
this Nationwide this bill has been
 
06:32:19.788 --> 06:32:19.798 align:start position:0%
adopted in several States including
 
06:32:19.798 --> 06:32:21.288 align:start position:0%
adopted in several States including
Colorado

06:32:21.288 --> 06:32:21.298 align:start position:0%
Colorado
 
06:32:24.708 --> 06:32:24.718 align:start position:0%
and that's not exactly a red state
 
06:32:28.970 --> 06:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
California again not exactly a red state
 
06:32:28.980 --> 06:32:30.830 align:start position:0%
California again not exactly a red state
Texas

06:32:30.830 --> 06:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
Texas
 
06:32:32.690 --> 06:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you that one
 
06:32:32.700 --> 06:32:35.650 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you that one
but

06:32:35.650 --> 06:32:35.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:38.690 --> 06:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
ah and several of the southern states
 
06:32:41.930 --> 06:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
have also adapted it including the Red
 
06:32:44.150 --> 06:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hills of Georgia and the neighboring
 
06:32:46.788 --> 06:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
state of Alabama both of whom had a
 
06:32:49.490 --> 06:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
rather interesting Civil Rights era
 
06:32:49.500 --> 06:32:50.990 align:start position:0%
rather interesting Civil Rights era
history

06:32:50.990 --> 06:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
history
 
06:32:54.708 --> 06:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
ah and with that the Bill's pres has
 
06:32:56.030 --> 06:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
been presented
 
06:32:57.948 --> 06:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
it talks about
 
06:33:00.288 --> 06:33:00.298 align:start position:0%
how to treat one another and how to
 
06:33:02.628 --> 06:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
factually express
 
06:33:05.270 --> 06:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
what has happened in history
 
06:33:08.990 --> 06:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
as an event that took place and not a
 
06:33:11.750 --> 06:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
sign blame on it but talk about how to
 
06:33:14.990 --> 06:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
prevent it from happening ever
 
06:33:15.000 --> 06:33:16.850 align:start position:0%
prevent it from happening ever
again

06:33:16.850 --> 06:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:33:18.288 --> 06:33:18.298 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to answer any
 
06:33:18.298 --> 06:33:20.510 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to answer any
questions

06:33:20.510 --> 06:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:33:22.548 --> 06:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
06:33:25.670 --> 06:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes represent Hall
 
06:33:28.070 --> 06:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:33:30.170 --> 06:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I know it says
 
06:33:31.788 --> 06:33:31.798 align:start position:0%
that the department
 
06:33:34.070 --> 06:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
um feels like they need to hire a
 
06:33:36.708 --> 06:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
part-time employee to oversee
 
06:33:39.708 --> 06:33:39.718 align:start position:0%
um this requirement and I noticed that
 
06:33:41.510 --> 06:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know it says in the language state
 
06:33:43.190 --> 06:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
board shall make available to all School
 
06:33:44.868 --> 06:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
boards instructional materials is that
 
06:33:47.030 --> 06:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
what is this person doing this part-time
 
06:33:51.230 --> 06:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
employee they just what are they doing
 
06:33:53.330 --> 06:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few employees in
 
06:33:55.310 --> 06:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
several agencies in this state that I
 
06:33:57.048 --> 06:33:57.058 align:start position:0%
would like to give the same answer to I
 
06:33:58.570 --> 06:33:58.580 align:start position:0%
have no idea
 
06:34:01.250 --> 06:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
however in this particular instance I
 
06:34:03.350 --> 06:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
would presume to think that they would
 
06:34:04.850 --> 06:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
oversee the presentation their
 
06:34:06.230 --> 06:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
acquisition of the material the
 
06:34:08.810 --> 06:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
presentation the material and assist in
 
06:34:10.368 --> 06:34:10.378 align:start position:0%
the training of individuals in
 
06:34:13.010 --> 06:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
presenting the material to the classes
 
06:34:14.810 --> 06:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
06:34:17.090 --> 06:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative Allison uh thank you Mr
 
06:34:18.910 --> 06:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:34:25.730 --> 06:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
uh on lines uh 11-13 in the bill uh it
 
06:34:28.510 --> 06:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
talks about a number of
 
06:34:31.490 --> 06:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
events that must be coach shall not be
 
06:34:35.030 --> 06:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
limited to must be covered uh the
 
06:34:37.010 --> 06:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and that goes on from there
 
06:34:39.770 --> 06:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
are you aware that the commission on
 
06:34:42.590 --> 06:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and general side studies has
 
06:34:44.690 --> 06:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
been in effect now for the last year and
 
06:34:47.150 --> 06:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
a half and instruction in New Hampshire
 
06:34:50.208 --> 06:34:50.218 align:start position:0%
schools is required and was required as
 
06:34:53.390 --> 06:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
of September 1st and in fact curriculum
 
06:34:55.070 --> 06:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
has been developed and is being
 
06:34:57.890 --> 06:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
implemented in middle school and high
 
06:35:00.770 --> 06:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
schools on almost all of those issues
 
06:35:02.750 --> 06:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
that are right there already
 
06:35:05.030 --> 06:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes and that's why it's there
 
06:35:08.448 --> 06:35:08.458 align:start position:0%
it's already it's already part of uh
 
06:35:10.970 --> 06:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
state law so therefore we're reaffirming
 
06:35:13.730 --> 06:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
it in state law
 
06:35:15.288 --> 06:35:15.298 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:35:17.628 --> 06:35:17.638 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:35:19.610 --> 06:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
06:35:21.410 --> 06:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
06:35:21.420 --> 06:35:22.850 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

06:35:22.850 --> 06:35:22.860 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:35:26.030 --> 06:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
um you you referenced McGraw-Hill
 
06:35:28.670 --> 06:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
um as one one group that had curriculum
 
06:35:31.670 --> 06:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
did is there a specific curriculum uh
 
06:35:33.830 --> 06:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
06:35:36.708 --> 06:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
that's with this particular
 
06:35:39.708 --> 06:35:39.718 align:start position:0%
um Civil Rights Movement from 54 to 68 I
 
06:35:41.750 --> 06:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
mean that that uh
 
06:35:44.270 --> 06:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
just deals with that particular part of
 
06:35:46.788 --> 06:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
the American history
 
06:35:49.730 --> 06:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
assaults yes there is a McGraw-Hill has
 
06:35:52.010 --> 06:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
that in Hispanic adopted by several
 
06:35:54.410 --> 06:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
state agencies already and it is my
 
06:35:55.910 --> 06:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
understanding although I've had no
 
06:35:58.010 --> 06:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
direct input into it but the Department
 
06:35:59.990 --> 06:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
of Education is in the process of
 
06:36:02.570 --> 06:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
reviewing that uh literature and
 
06:36:04.970 --> 06:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
presenting it to the Board of Education
 
06:36:04.980 --> 06:36:06.230 align:start position:0%
presenting it to the Board of Education
foreign

06:36:06.230 --> 06:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:36:07.788 --> 06:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
06:36:11.448 --> 06:36:11.458 align:start position:0%
um do you have a name of that curriculum
 
06:36:13.430 --> 06:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
Martin Luther King civil rights
 
06:36:16.850 --> 06:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
education okay thank you
 
06:36:18.770 --> 06:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:36:21.830 --> 06:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes represent Alexis
 
06:36:24.010 --> 06:36:24.020 align:start position:0%
just making sure I understand
 
06:36:27.590 --> 06:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
while that is a program that you know is
 
06:36:30.590 --> 06:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
out there you're not actually
 
06:36:32.570 --> 06:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
um pushing for any particular program
 
06:36:35.330 --> 06:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
right you're leaving it up to local
 
06:36:37.548 --> 06:36:37.558 align:start position:0%
choice to decide how they're going to
 
06:36:39.590 --> 06:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
implement this is that correct
 
06:36:42.110 --> 06:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's correct uh representative Lakers
 
06:36:43.970 --> 06:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
and is that you're aware in our local
 
06:36:46.850 --> 06:36:46.860 align:start position:0%
high school uh this is uh to some degree
 
06:36:50.448 --> 06:36:50.458 align:start position:0%
already taught uh based upon uh broadly
 
06:36:53.288 --> 06:36:53.298 align:start position:0%
the same activities this is just merely
 
06:36:57.610 --> 06:36:57.620 align:start position:0%
uh placing it the law and aspect of a
 
06:37:00.890 --> 06:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
methodology uh which should be
 
06:37:02.990 --> 06:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
implemented in each one of the schools
 
06:37:06.948 --> 06:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
so that people are aware of what took
 
06:37:09.190 --> 06:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
place and
 
06:37:14.090 --> 06:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
why Dr King made his his speech
 
06:37:14.100 --> 06:37:15.590 align:start position:0%
why Dr King made his his speech
um

06:37:15.590 --> 06:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:17.270 --> 06:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
frankly I would mandate that every
 
06:37:19.190 --> 06:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
student be required to listen to it but
 
06:37:21.288 --> 06:37:21.298 align:start position:0%
that's not going to happen but anyway
 
06:37:23.030 --> 06:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:37:25.850 --> 06:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Belcher
 
06:37:27.890 --> 06:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:37:30.530 --> 06:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
I certainly would agree that the items
 
06:37:32.090 --> 06:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
listed on here are are excellent
 
06:37:33.890 --> 06:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
teaching topics and they're things that
 
06:37:35.990 --> 06:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
all students should should know and
 
06:37:38.390 --> 06:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
learn from history but the manner in
 
06:37:40.490 --> 06:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
which they're taught also I think is is
 
06:37:40.500 --> 06:37:42.230 align:start position:0%
which they're taught also I think is is
important

06:37:42.230 --> 06:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
important
 
06:37:44.628 --> 06:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
um so I'm hoping you can assuage any
 
06:37:47.270 --> 06:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
concerns I may have that some of the
 
06:37:49.548 --> 06:37:49.558 align:start position:0%
more modern groups we see popping up who
 
06:37:51.590 --> 06:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
are for instance
 
06:37:55.128 --> 06:37:55.138 align:start position:0%
um uh dismissing the legacy of dot Dr
 
06:37:59.208 --> 06:37:59.218 align:start position:0%
Martin Luther King in favor of promoting
 
06:38:00.948 --> 06:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
um for instance the Black Panther Party
 
06:38:02.750 --> 06:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
as the true inheritors of the Civil
 
06:38:04.250 --> 06:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
Rights Act
 
06:38:05.990 --> 06:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
um how can we how can I be certain that
 
06:38:07.310 --> 06:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
this isn't something that's going to be
 
06:38:10.010 --> 06:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh potentially hijacked as a vehicle for
 
06:38:13.128 --> 06:38:13.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:13.138 --> 06:38:14.948 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:38:14.948 --> 06:38:14.958 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:38:18.230 --> 06:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
talks about the principles in which Dr
 
06:38:20.690 --> 06:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
King was presenting
 
06:38:24.530 --> 06:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
the uh if you read speech
 
06:38:28.070 --> 06:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I would if the chair once I have the
 
06:38:30.170 --> 06:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
speech dot up here I can go ahead and
 
06:38:33.048 --> 06:38:33.058 align:start position:0%
give it but if not it's okay too but he
 
06:38:35.750 --> 06:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
talks about how we can cooperate and
 
06:38:38.330 --> 06:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
where the he uses the term in his speech
 
06:38:44.030 --> 06:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
the Negro has to uh forsake violence in
 
06:38:46.910 --> 06:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
order to work with and
 
06:38:49.850 --> 06:38:49.860 align:start position:0%
the also says where the white person has
 
06:38:52.310 --> 06:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
to understand that they're part and
 
06:38:55.190 --> 06:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
parcel of the same Legacy as is the
 
06:38:55.200 --> 06:38:56.510 align:start position:0%
parcel of the same Legacy as is the
Negro

06:38:56.510 --> 06:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
Negro
 
06:38:59.030 --> 06:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and that's just a factual statement
 
06:39:00.770 --> 06:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
in history
 
06:39:06.530 --> 06:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:08.930 --> 06:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
how can you prevent something from being
 
06:39:08.940 --> 06:39:10.250 align:start position:0%
how can you prevent something from being
hijacked

06:39:10.250 --> 06:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
hijacked
 
06:39:12.288 --> 06:39:12.298 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily that you can
 
06:39:14.448 --> 06:39:14.458 align:start position:0%
prevent anything from being hijacked you
 
06:39:17.570 --> 06:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
can take a bill talking about the Pledge
 
06:39:19.610 --> 06:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
of Allegiance and someone's going to say
 
06:39:21.708 --> 06:39:21.718 align:start position:0%
well no no no that was created by a
 
06:39:21.718 --> 06:39:23.030 align:start position:0%
well no no no that was created by a
socialist

socialist
 
06:39:25.788 --> 06:39:25.798 align:start position:0%
oh it was but that's not what it is now
 
06:39:29.090 --> 06:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
uh stopping something from happening is
 
06:39:29.100 --> 06:39:30.110 align:start position:0%
uh stopping something from happening is
do

06:39:30.110 --> 06:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:39:34.730 --> 06:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
to the due diligence of uh
 
06:39:37.430 --> 06:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature the Board of Education
 
06:39:39.410 --> 06:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
and the individual that they would hire
 
06:39:43.310 --> 06:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
to oversee the programming and the local
 
06:39:45.590 --> 06:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
school boards and local communities
 
06:39:48.708 --> 06:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
I need to have a participation of
 
06:39:51.110 --> 06:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
parents you need to have participation
 
06:39:53.150 --> 06:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
for the school board in this type of
 
06:39:56.208 --> 06:39:56.218 align:start position:0%
activity that's where at the local level
 
06:39:59.690 --> 06:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
where you can maintain this and that's
 
06:40:01.548 --> 06:40:01.558 align:start position:0%
where due diligence comes into play
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
06:40:05.570 --> 06:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock thank you
 
06:40:07.548 --> 06:40:07.558 align:start position:0%
chairman good afternoon thank you for
 
06:40:09.830 --> 06:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm looking at the
 
06:40:11.690 --> 06:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
bill I'm particularly online three and
 
06:40:14.030 --> 06:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
four basically the that's the essence of
 
06:40:14.990 --> 06:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:40:17.410 --> 06:40:17.420 align:start position:0%
if I if I read your bill correctly
 
06:40:21.288 --> 06:40:21.298 align:start position:0%
you're correct sir okay so is it um your
 
06:40:24.048 --> 06:40:24.058 align:start position:0%
opinion then that uh under the current
 
06:40:25.730 --> 06:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
U.S history classes that are being
 
06:40:27.170 --> 06:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
taught in public high schools today in
 
06:40:29.750 --> 06:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's not included it's
 
06:40:31.730 --> 06:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
not included to the detail in which it
 
06:40:34.610 --> 06:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
probably should be included I'm aware
 
06:40:39.410 --> 06:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I do some uh uh I know lecturing
 
06:40:41.930 --> 06:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
would not be the right word but uh uh
 
06:40:44.410 --> 06:40:44.420 align:start position:0%
sit down and discuss in certain uh
 
06:40:47.330 --> 06:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
classes at Auburn High School on
 
06:40:51.288 --> 06:40:51.298 align:start position:0%
occasion and uh this is not a primary
 
06:40:55.670 --> 06:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
topic because uh it it just isn't a
 
06:40:59.208 --> 06:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
primary topic uh whereas I believe that
 
06:41:00.650 --> 06:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
particular error
 
06:41:00.660 --> 06:41:01.970 align:start position:0%
particular error
era

06:41:01.970 --> 06:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
era
 
06:41:05.690 --> 06:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
had uh well it had a strong impact on me
 
06:41:07.970 --> 06:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
I would got caught up in a couple of
 
06:41:09.830 --> 06:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
different events and in different
 
06:41:12.110 --> 06:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
communities in which uh I found myself
 
06:41:15.048 --> 06:41:15.058 align:start position:0%
at different times uh in Chicago and in
 
06:41:18.048 --> 06:41:18.058 align:start position:0%
uh and in Elkhart
 
06:41:19.970 --> 06:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
plus I also
 
06:41:23.090 --> 06:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh had friends and and down that lived
 
06:41:24.830 --> 06:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
down a while family lived down in
 
06:41:27.590 --> 06:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
Detroit so very aware of what was going
 
06:41:30.110 --> 06:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
on very aware of the activities
 
06:41:32.750 --> 06:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
if I might Mr chair could relate an
 
06:41:34.430 --> 06:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
incident that took place in Harlem
 
06:41:34.440 --> 06:41:36.170 align:start position:0%
incident that took place in Harlem
Kentucky

06:41:36.170 --> 06:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
Kentucky
 
06:41:38.208 --> 06:41:38.218 align:start position:0%
um many of you know that my mother's
 
06:41:40.368 --> 06:41:40.378 align:start position:0%
family is from there Harlem bloody
 
06:41:42.650 --> 06:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
Harlan if you will for a variety of
 
06:41:45.830 --> 06:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
different reasons and moonshine was part
 
06:41:47.628 --> 06:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
of it
 
06:41:50.868 --> 06:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
but it's an Apple watch
 
06:41:50.878 --> 06:41:52.730 align:start position:0%
but it's an Apple watch
spin

06:41:52.730 --> 06:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
spin
 
06:41:56.628 --> 06:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
it was no problem for the youngsters to
 
06:41:59.810 --> 06:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
go out and swim in the Cumberland River
 
06:42:02.330 --> 06:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
not exactly a good idea considering it
 
06:42:05.628 --> 06:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
was a Class D River at the time but you
 
06:42:08.150 --> 06:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
know it's hot summer day you go out you
 
06:42:09.890 --> 06:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
swim with it it made no difference who
 
06:42:12.410 --> 06:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
we were and then the difference showed
 
06:42:12.420 --> 06:42:13.128 align:start position:0%
we were and then the difference showed
up

06:42:13.128 --> 06:42:13.138 align:start position:0%
up
 
06:42:15.230 --> 06:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
dad why are there two drinking Fountains
 
06:42:17.208 --> 06:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
at the Town Hall
 
06:42:19.548 --> 06:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
and it didn't make any sense to me
 
06:42:22.970 --> 06:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense to me now deck up
 
06:42:22.980 --> 06:42:24.410 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense to me now deck up
corrected

06:42:24.410 --> 06:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
corrected
 
06:42:29.090 --> 06:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
and the the strength of the species the
 
06:42:31.430 --> 06:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
the speeches that took back effect at
 
06:42:34.010 --> 06:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
the time the difference between Malcolm
 
06:42:34.020 --> 06:42:34.970 align:start position:0%
the time the difference between Malcolm
X

06:42:34.970 --> 06:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
X
 
06:42:37.670 --> 06:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
and Martin Luther King's approach where
 
06:42:40.190 --> 06:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
one was advocating violence and the
 
06:42:42.830 --> 06:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
other was advocating understanding in a
 
06:42:44.208 --> 06:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
Christian approach
 
06:42:47.090 --> 06:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
I chose the Christian approach
 
06:42:50.570 --> 06:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
just I love you thank you so basically
 
06:42:52.670 --> 06:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
the antenna hour then is just to add
 
06:42:55.548 --> 06:42:55.558 align:start position:0%
what is it's already in most public
 
06:42:57.708 --> 06:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
school curricula so you're you're a
 
06:42:59.570 --> 06:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
tenth of the bill just to make that more
 
06:43:01.430 --> 06:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
reinforced in the curriculum
 
06:43:03.470 --> 06:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you thank you Chevrolet
 
06:43:05.750 --> 06:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to follow along with represent
 
06:43:08.030 --> 06:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
woodcock's line of thinking
 
06:43:09.590 --> 06:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
um we know that in this state
 
06:43:12.350 --> 06:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
instruction curriculum are a local
 
06:43:15.048 --> 06:43:15.058 align:start position:0%
concern by Statute
 
06:43:18.948 --> 06:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
have you taken the time to do a Beyond
 
06:43:18.958 --> 06:43:20.208 align:start position:0%
have you taken the time to do a Beyond
alverne

06:43:20.208 --> 06:43:20.218 align:start position:0%
alverne
 
06:43:25.730 --> 06:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
to take out a Statewide search or review
 
06:43:28.368 --> 06:43:28.378 align:start position:0%
by way of various associations be it the
 
06:43:31.970 --> 06:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
social studies Association to determine
 
06:43:34.628 --> 06:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
if this is needed
 
06:43:38.090 --> 06:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
and or what is being taught within
 
06:43:40.850 --> 06:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
schools so we are going to if we're
 
06:43:43.548 --> 06:43:43.558 align:start position:0%
going to mandate something which this is
 
06:43:46.128 --> 06:43:46.138 align:start position:0%
then we're doing it because we see it's
 
06:43:50.628 --> 06:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
not just a a local concern but a concern
 
06:43:50.638 --> 06:43:53.750 align:start position:0%
not just a a local concern but a concern
Statewide

06:43:53.750 --> 06:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:55.548 --> 06:43:55.558 align:start position:0%
no sir I don't have the individual
 
06:43:57.470 --> 06:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
resources nor do any of us have the
 
06:43:59.330 --> 06:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
resources to undertake that on our own
 
06:44:01.510 --> 06:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
however I am aware that the uh
 
06:44:03.770 --> 06:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of education is is
 
06:44:05.930 --> 06:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
reviewing the different aspects that
 
06:44:08.030 --> 06:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
have taken place in this and has
 
06:44:10.250 --> 06:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
discussed this on a Statewide basis I
 
06:44:11.510 --> 06:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
leave that to the Department of
 
06:44:14.208 --> 06:44:14.218 align:start position:0%
Education to undertake that type of
 
06:44:18.610 --> 06:44:18.620 align:start position:0%
activity I will say that from uh their
 
06:44:22.670 --> 06:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
my contacts at Albert High School uh the
 
06:44:28.368 --> 06:44:28.378 align:start position:0%
impact on this is It's haphazard at best
 
06:44:33.288 --> 06:44:33.298 align:start position:0%
and this gives guidance to the school
 
06:44:36.890 --> 06:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
boards for their local input is to how
 
06:44:38.930 --> 06:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
it goes this says this needs to be
 
06:44:41.510 --> 06:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
included that's all it says
 
06:44:44.150 --> 06:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
this needs to be included it doesn't say
 
06:44:46.190 --> 06:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to be taught this way but it
 
06:44:49.788 --> 06:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
says these things need to be examined in
 
06:44:54.410 --> 06:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
some detail not glossed over not uh
 
06:44:59.570 --> 06:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
given uh follow up then if in fact
 
06:45:01.430 --> 06:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
you're identifying this in this school
 
06:45:03.650 --> 06:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
district has there been any effort made
 
06:45:05.750 --> 06:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
with the school board for them to
 
06:45:07.190 --> 06:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
mandate that this becomes part of
 
06:45:07.200 --> 06:45:09.110 align:start position:0%
mandate that this becomes part of
curriculum

06:45:09.110 --> 06:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
06:45:10.730 --> 06:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
um not right now they're trying to put
 
06:45:14.270 --> 06:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
in some security systems and uh their
 
06:45:16.368 --> 06:45:16.378 align:start position:0%
their impact is uh
 
06:45:19.610 --> 06:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
been regarding uh adding an auditorium
 
06:45:22.548 --> 06:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
adding a stage expanding the size of the
 
06:45:24.590 --> 06:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
high school and
 
06:45:28.090 --> 06:45:28.100 align:start position:0%
um putting in a new uh uh driveway
 
06:45:31.850 --> 06:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
entryway security system uh regarding
 
06:45:34.368 --> 06:45:34.378 align:start position:0%
the educational aspects those are a
 
06:45:35.810 --> 06:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
little bit further down on the board of
 
06:45:39.708 --> 06:45:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:41.150 --> 06:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the questions
 
06:45:43.510 --> 06:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
06:45:47.930 --> 06:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of concerned and wonder why uh
 
06:45:50.930 --> 06:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
since I lived through that time as well
 
06:45:53.208 --> 06:45:53.218 align:start position:0%
um that others that it was a Civil
 
06:45:55.910 --> 06:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
Rights era but it wasn't just
 
06:45:58.010 --> 06:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
um for the black people it was a gay
 
06:46:00.770 --> 06:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
rights uh era it was a women's rights
 
06:46:02.750 --> 06:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
era and
 
06:46:02.760 --> 06:46:03.590 align:start position:0%
era and
um

06:46:03.590 --> 06:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:05.510 --> 06:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of lessons to be learned
 
06:46:08.750 --> 06:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
there as well and I'm I am wondering why
 
06:46:12.410 --> 06:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
we're just picking you know Cherry not
 
06:46:14.390 --> 06:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
only that it's telling curriculum which
 
06:46:17.030 --> 06:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think should happen but it's
 
06:46:19.010 --> 06:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
it's taking a curriculum and it's cherry
 
06:46:21.650 --> 06:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
picking and just a certain part of the
 
06:46:23.990 --> 06:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights era
 
06:46:26.570 --> 06:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
well there's those are three uh
 
06:46:28.730 --> 06:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
different things and that they were uh
 
06:46:30.770 --> 06:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
contiguous but they weren't quite in the
 
06:46:33.830 --> 06:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
same era the so the uh uh women's right
 
06:46:35.750 --> 06:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that came forward is talking
 
06:46:38.650 --> 06:46:38.660 align:start position:0%
about an equality and gender which is
 
06:46:41.570 --> 06:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
substantially different than race
 
06:46:45.230 --> 06:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
relations and the gay rights uh are came
 
06:46:48.650 --> 06:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
in towards the uh uh I forget when the
 
06:46:50.810 --> 06:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
the name of the club that was rated by
 
06:46:53.270 --> 06:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
the New York police that uh that's one
 
06:46:55.670 --> 06:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
that that came forward and again that's
 
06:46:59.628 --> 06:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
uh a difference of uh not equipment they
 
06:47:03.730 --> 06:47:03.740 align:start position:0%
should not be equilocated with the uh
 
06:47:07.548 --> 06:47:07.558 align:start position:0%
civil rights or the race relations
 
06:47:07.558 --> 06:47:10.310 align:start position:0%
civil rights or the race relations
um error

06:47:10.310 --> 06:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
um error
 
06:47:12.770 --> 06:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
rights belong to people
 
06:47:16.368 --> 06:47:16.378 align:start position:0%
as individual rights they and this
 
06:47:17.990 --> 06:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
particular one talks about the
 
06:47:19.670 --> 06:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
Discrimination that took place because
 
06:47:23.448 --> 06:47:23.458 align:start position:0%
of a person's skin color or because of a
 
06:47:27.590 --> 06:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
bias and and uh in that area now
 
06:47:30.770 --> 06:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
when you address the prime this part as
 
06:47:32.990 --> 06:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
a primary one and I don't mean to
 
06:47:35.150 --> 06:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
denigrate women they're 50 of the
 
06:47:38.448 --> 06:47:38.458 align:start position:0%
population or or gays that you know
 
06:47:41.390 --> 06:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's in the family as well uh
 
06:47:46.250 --> 06:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
but those issues become ameliorated when
 
06:47:48.770 --> 06:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
you address the larger
 
06:47:52.910 --> 06:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
if you will issue of race relations
 
06:47:55.490 --> 06:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
because if you can learn to treat
 
06:47:58.128 --> 06:47:58.138 align:start position:0%
the guy sitting next to you
 
06:48:01.128 --> 06:48:01.138 align:start position:0%
equally you can learn
 
06:48:05.770 --> 06:48:05.780 align:start position:0%
individually to treat a woman or
 
06:48:09.350 --> 06:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
your gay guy at the bar that's sits
 
06:48:10.788 --> 06:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
there and makes
 
06:48:13.910 --> 06:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking of a person who he was
 
06:48:17.330 --> 06:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
making stupid jokes at the local bar but
 
06:48:17.340 --> 06:48:19.788 align:start position:0%
making stupid jokes at the local bar but
uh

06:48:19.788 --> 06:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:48:26.030 --> 06:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:28.670 --> 06:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
yes you may I I'm looking at the
 
06:48:30.410 --> 06:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
statement that's the study of this
 
06:48:32.810 --> 06:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
material is a reaffirmation of the
 
06:48:34.490 --> 06:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
commitment of free peoples of this state
 
06:48:37.128 --> 06:48:37.138 align:start position:0%
to reject bigotry to Champion equal
 
06:48:39.410 --> 06:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
protection under the law as a
 
06:48:40.910 --> 06:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
foundational principle of our Republic
 
06:48:43.330 --> 06:48:43.340 align:start position:0%
and to act in opposition to Injustice
 
06:48:47.930 --> 06:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
when wherever it may occur and
 
06:48:51.410 --> 06:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
certainly the civil rights movement that
 
06:48:54.230 --> 06:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
embodied the women's rights movement and
 
06:48:57.110 --> 06:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
the gay rights movement was a part of
 
06:49:01.270 --> 06:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
that and I
 
06:49:05.270 --> 06:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
fundamentally don't understand how race
 
06:49:07.310 --> 06:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
relations solves the problem of
 
06:49:11.208 --> 06:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
homophobia and misogyny so
 
06:49:13.128 --> 06:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
06:49:15.048 --> 06:49:15.058 align:start position:0%
I guess that's I still don't understand
 
06:49:18.110 --> 06:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
why it isn't part of that whole career
 
06:49:20.510 --> 06:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of represent
 
06:49:20.520 --> 06:49:21.530 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of represent
ulrey

06:49:21.530 --> 06:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
ulrey
 
06:49:23.810 --> 06:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
now see thank you very much thank you Mr
 
06:49:27.288 --> 06:49:27.298 align:start position:0%
chair uh next person speak is Turin
 
06:49:30.530 --> 06:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
oh you got me
 
06:49:30.540 --> 06:49:35.990 align:start position:0%
oh you got me
c-a-k-i-r-a-g-a

06:49:35.990 --> 06:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:36.000 --> 06:50:03.368 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:50:03.368 --> 06:50:03.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:08.770 --> 06:50:08.780 align:start position:0%
or or a professional person I'm just uh
 
06:50:13.910 --> 06:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
here to uh to oppose a part of the and
 
06:50:16.208 --> 06:50:16.218 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:50:20.890 --> 06:50:20.900 align:start position:0%
this is a a noble bill I I really
 
06:50:25.670 --> 06:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate the uh that we all
 
06:50:27.948 --> 06:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
have we all oppose the the
 
06:50:32.448 --> 06:50:32.458 align:start position:0%
Discrimination definitely but there's a
 
06:50:36.350 --> 06:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
section in the bill that is that talks
 
06:50:39.890 --> 06:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
about the Armenian Genocide
 
06:50:42.468 --> 06:50:42.478 align:start position:0%
and that's that is
 
06:50:46.990 --> 06:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
a more than a hundred year old debate
 
06:50:47.000 --> 06:50:49.208 align:start position:0%
a more than a hundred year old debate
that

06:50:49.208 --> 06:50:49.218 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:50:52.490 --> 06:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
I feel does not really
 
06:50:54.650 --> 06:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
and belong to
 
06:50:59.170 --> 06:50:59.180 align:start position:0%
uh to to introduce a youngest youngsters
 
06:51:03.730 --> 06:51:03.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:06.530 --> 06:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
events that took lucky during World War
 
06:51:11.208 --> 06:51:11.218 align:start position:0%
One so after more than 100 years old 100
 
06:51:14.448 --> 06:51:14.458 align:start position:0%
years we are still debating a weird
 
06:51:16.030 --> 06:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
06:51:19.570 --> 06:51:19.580 align:start position:0%
add something as speculative
 
06:51:25.930 --> 06:51:25.940 align:start position:0%
to this build and uh you know did this
 
06:51:30.110 --> 06:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
idea of a so-called genocide is is
 
06:51:34.448 --> 06:51:34.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:38.750 --> 06:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
really accepted by a United Nations or
 
06:51:43.610 --> 06:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
or a world court or anything like that
 
06:51:48.730 --> 06:51:48.740 align:start position:0%
even though some countries like ours
 
06:51:52.570 --> 06:51:52.580 align:start position:0%
have accepted that this
 
06:51:58.208 --> 06:51:58.218 align:start position:0%
event occurred multiced have
 
06:52:01.430 --> 06:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
according to to the knowledge that I
 
06:52:04.030 --> 06:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
know both sides have suffered
 
06:52:07.330 --> 06:52:07.340 align:start position:0%
tremendously so I don't
 
06:52:10.030 --> 06:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
if you're comfortable
 
06:52:13.368 --> 06:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
including this kind of conspicuous of
 
06:52:17.410 --> 06:52:17.420 align:start position:0%
information and and
 
06:52:20.230 --> 06:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
introducing introducing this kind of a
 
06:52:23.590 --> 06:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh speaker the information to our
 
06:52:25.868 --> 06:52:25.878 align:start position:0%
youngsters especially
 
06:52:32.288 --> 06:52:32.298 align:start position:0%
uh you know middle schoolers or uh
 
06:52:35.930 --> 06:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
or younger youngsters
 
06:52:39.530 --> 06:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
and because uh this is the perfect way
 
06:52:41.468 --> 06:52:41.478 align:start position:0%
to to
 
06:52:46.368 --> 06:52:46.378 align:start position:0%
introduce our our ideas whether they're
 
06:52:47.590 --> 06:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
wrong or
 
06:52:47.600 --> 06:52:49.810 align:start position:0%
wrong or
correct

06:52:49.810 --> 06:52:49.820 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:52:54.368 --> 06:52:54.378 align:start position:0%
is first way to uh
 
06:52:56.448 --> 06:52:56.458 align:start position:0%
have have
 
06:52:59.650 --> 06:52:59.660 align:start position:0%
all our youngsters and
 
06:53:04.010 --> 06:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
Bully each other and and I feel that
 
06:53:08.208 --> 06:53:08.218 align:start position:0%
that we should include in anything like
 
06:53:08.218 --> 06:53:09.590 align:start position:0%
that we should include in anything like
this

06:53:09.590 --> 06:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:53:11.990 --> 06:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
06:53:15.708 --> 06:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:19.070 --> 06:53:19.080 align:start position:0%

um

06:53:35.410 --> 06:53:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:37.548 --> 06:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Ladd good afternoon
 
06:53:39.110 --> 06:53:39.120 align:start position:0%

from the New Hampshire school boards
 
06:53:43.430 --> 06:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
Association uh we are opposed to House
 
06:53:45.468 --> 06:53:45.478 align:start position:0%
Bill 309
 
06:53:47.150 --> 06:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate representative's
 
06:53:49.010 --> 06:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
explanation as to how and why this bill
 
06:53:51.170 --> 06:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
came about there are certainly a
 
06:53:53.750 --> 06:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
laudable expectations of what should be
 
06:53:56.530 --> 06:53:56.540 align:start position:0%
taught in our schools
 
06:54:00.170 --> 06:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
however nhsba has a couple long-standing
 
06:54:00.180 --> 06:54:01.430 align:start position:0%
however nhsba has a couple long-standing
resolutions

06:54:01.430 --> 06:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
resolutions
 
06:54:03.650 --> 06:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
um as we've talked about with
 
06:54:05.090 --> 06:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
representative moffett's Bill about
 
06:54:08.030 --> 06:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
teaching communism in schools one of our
 
06:54:10.910 --> 06:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
resolutions states that local school
 
06:54:12.590 --> 06:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
boards have the responsibility for
 
06:54:13.730 --> 06:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
establishing the structure
 
06:54:15.708 --> 06:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
accountability advocacy and delivery of
 
06:54:17.948 --> 06:54:17.958 align:start position:0%
instruction within their local districts
 
06:54:17.958 --> 06:54:19.750 align:start position:0%
instruction within their local districts
also

06:54:19.750 --> 06:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:54:23.628 --> 06:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
nhsba supports the affirmation of the
 
06:54:26.330 --> 06:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
responsibility of for Education resides
 
06:54:28.430 --> 06:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
with the states and have delegated to
 
06:54:30.230 --> 06:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
Local School boards the power and
 
06:54:32.690 --> 06:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
authority to adopt policies establish
 
06:54:35.090 --> 06:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
priorities and provide account abilities
 
06:54:38.090 --> 06:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth another aspect is an
 
06:54:42.350 --> 06:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 189 colon 1-A which at hsba wrote
 
06:54:44.530 --> 06:54:44.540 align:start position:0%
with chairman Ladd a number of years ago
 
06:54:46.730 --> 06:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
elected School boards shall be
 
06:54:48.468 --> 06:54:48.478 align:start position:0%
responsible for establishing the
 
06:54:51.048 --> 06:54:51.058 align:start position:0%
structure accountability advocacy and
 
06:54:54.288 --> 06:54:54.298 align:start position:0%
delivery of instruction in each School
 
06:54:55.850 --> 06:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
operating governed by the school
 
06:54:58.010 --> 06:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
district so will nhsb certainly
 
06:54:59.510 --> 06:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
recognizes that the state has a
 
06:55:02.150 --> 06:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility to establish the
 
06:55:03.948 --> 06:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
substantive content of an adequate
 
06:55:07.850 --> 06:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
education as found in RSA 193e colon 2
 
06:55:10.548 --> 06:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
the delivery of that instruction at HSB
 
06:55:13.310 --> 06:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
nhsba believes is best left to the local
 
06:55:15.048 --> 06:55:15.058 align:start position:0%
school districts to develop their own
 
06:55:17.510 --> 06:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum their own coursework so on
 
06:55:20.750 --> 06:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
and so forth two other aspects that I'll
 
06:55:23.570 --> 06:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
I'll mention in nhsp's opposition to
 
06:55:24.788 --> 06:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:55:27.650 --> 06:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
the first is that we see a lot of bills
 
06:55:30.530 --> 06:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
being put in RSA 189 189 is an
 
06:55:33.708 --> 06:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
overarching statute relative to school
 
06:55:35.330 --> 06:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
boards and a lot of responsibilities
 
06:55:37.430 --> 06:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
that school boards have there's a number
 
06:55:39.650 --> 06:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
of Provisions colon one through colon I
 
06:55:41.628 --> 06:55:41.638 align:start position:0%
think we're up to I don't know 73 or
 
06:55:44.390 --> 06:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
something like that now and hsba would
 
06:55:46.128 --> 06:55:46.138 align:start position:0%
argue that if we're going to be putting
 
06:55:49.128 --> 06:55:49.138 align:start position:0%
curricular content within statute it
 
06:55:52.390 --> 06:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
needs to go in the adequacy statute RSA
 
06:55:55.670 --> 06:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
193-e and then the back end of that is
 
06:55:57.350 --> 06:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
the state has an obligation to pay for
 
06:55:58.730 --> 06:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
it the state has an obligation
 
06:56:01.310 --> 06:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to pay for the
 
06:56:03.770 --> 06:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
content of an adequate education so by
 
06:56:05.448 --> 06:56:05.458 align:start position:0%
continuing to put these Provisions in
 
06:56:09.250 --> 06:56:09.260 align:start position:0%
RSA 189 the state is obvious
 
06:56:12.230 --> 06:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
ignoring its responsibility to pay for
 
06:56:14.628 --> 06:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
it instead of putting it in RSA 193
 
06:56:17.270 --> 06:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
colon e or Dash e the adequate education
 
06:56:19.910 --> 06:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
statute we might still object if it were
 
06:56:22.368 --> 06:56:22.378 align:start position:0%
put in RSA 193e but it'd be a little bit
 
06:56:24.288 --> 06:56:24.298 align:start position:0%
more palatable from a school board
 
06:56:25.730 --> 06:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
provision because we know we'd be
 
06:56:27.410 --> 06:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
getting it'd be included in the adequacy
 
06:56:30.048 --> 06:56:30.058 align:start position:0%
formula the other aspect that this
 
06:56:32.030 --> 06:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum should be very very mindful
 
06:56:34.368 --> 06:56:34.378 align:start position:0%
of this session is that I think
 
06:56:37.250 --> 06:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that the Department of
 
06:56:38.810 --> 06:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
Education through the State Board of
 
06:56:42.048 --> 06:56:42.058 align:start position:0%
Education is in the um in the midst of
 
06:56:45.350 --> 06:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
doing a very comprehensive review to
 
06:56:48.350 --> 06:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education role Ed 306 the
 
06:56:49.788 --> 06:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
minimum standards
 
06:56:52.968 --> 06:56:52.978 align:start position:0%
um for public school approval that rule
 
06:56:55.670 --> 06:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
is about 80 pages long it's a six-point
 
06:56:58.128 --> 06:56:58.138 align:start position:0%
font without everything that a school
 
06:57:00.350 --> 06:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
district has to do curricular course
 
06:57:02.750 --> 06:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
offerings curricular standards policies
 
06:57:05.448 --> 06:57:05.458 align:start position:0%
by school boards graduation minimum
 
06:57:07.490 --> 06:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements so on and so
 
06:57:10.548 --> 06:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
forth so we know that over the next I'd
 
06:57:13.128 --> 06:57:13.138 align:start position:0%
say probably my best estimation would be
 
06:57:16.070 --> 06:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
six to eight months the State Board
 
06:57:18.890 --> 06:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
through their processes is undergoing a
 
06:57:20.628 --> 06:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
complete revision of department of
 
06:57:23.330 --> 06:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
educational 306 again the minimum
 
06:57:25.070 --> 06:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
standards what our districts have to do
 
06:57:27.048 --> 06:57:27.058 align:start position:0%
and offer and provide
 
06:57:30.670 --> 06:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
by adding these curricular components to
 
06:57:33.770 --> 06:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
statute outside of the minimum stand
 
06:57:35.690 --> 06:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
outside of the adequacy statute excuse
 
06:57:38.270 --> 06:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
me there's inevitably going to be some
 
06:57:40.250 --> 06:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
conflict moving forward between what the
 
06:57:42.948 --> 06:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
final outcome of the minimum standards
 
06:57:44.448 --> 06:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
revisions which I'm guessing is going to
 
06:57:46.490 --> 06:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
take another six eight months maybe a
 
06:57:48.770 --> 06:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
year versus whatever pending legislation
 
06:57:51.410 --> 06:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
we may get coming out of this Committee
 
06:57:54.170 --> 06:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire legislature so for
 
06:57:56.208 --> 06:57:56.218 align:start position:0%
those reasons nhfba opposes this bill
 
06:57:57.890 --> 06:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
not because of the content but because
 
06:58:00.170 --> 06:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
of sort of all of our long-standing
 
06:58:03.170 --> 06:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
resolutions about nhsba posing the the
 
06:58:05.690 --> 06:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
legislature dictating what curriculum
 
06:58:07.310 --> 06:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
should be taught within our local school
 
06:58:09.230 --> 06:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
districts so and with that I'm happy to
 
06:58:11.150 --> 06:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you very much
 
06:58:12.650 --> 06:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
are there any questions just
 
06:58:14.208 --> 06:58:14.218 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
06:58:15.890 --> 06:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:58:15.900 --> 06:58:16.448 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

06:58:16.448 --> 06:58:16.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:19.128 --> 06:58:19.138 align:start position:0%
I heard you say that
 
06:58:20.448 --> 06:58:20.458 align:start position:0%
um local school boards should be
 
06:58:22.190 --> 06:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
primarily tasked with developing
 
06:58:22.200 --> 06:58:23.930 align:start position:0%
primarily tasked with developing
curriculum

06:58:23.930 --> 06:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
06:58:26.570 --> 06:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me approximately to what
 
06:58:28.190 --> 06:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
degree local school boards are currently
 
06:58:29.628 --> 06:58:29.638 align:start position:0%
developing their own curriculum versus
 
06:58:31.368 --> 06:58:31.378 align:start position:0%
obtaining that curriculum from outside
 
06:58:33.590 --> 06:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
organizations and sources yeah thank you
 
06:58:34.448 --> 06:58:34.458 align:start position:0%
very much for the question
 
06:58:36.708 --> 06:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
representative we had a lot of
 
06:58:38.448 --> 06:58:38.458 align:start position:0%
conversations last year didn't we about
 
06:58:40.250 --> 06:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
school board oversight relative to
 
06:58:42.650 --> 06:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
curriculum when you say you know outside
 
06:58:44.628 --> 06:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
of organizations I'm not exactly sure
 
06:58:46.128 --> 06:58:46.138 align:start position:0%
what you mean I heard your comment to
 
06:58:49.010 --> 06:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
the to the the um the prime the prime
 
06:58:51.048 --> 06:58:51.058 align:start position:0%
sponsor earlier so I get this just of
 
06:58:53.270 --> 06:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
what you're getting at you know the the
 
06:58:54.650 --> 06:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
school boards are I mean they're
 
06:58:55.968 --> 06:58:55.978 align:start position:0%
ultimately responsible for the
 
06:58:57.948 --> 06:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
curriculum in the sense that they're the
 
06:58:59.390 --> 06:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
elected officials at the end of the day
 
06:59:00.948 --> 06:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
the buck stops with the with the elected
 
06:59:02.690 --> 06:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
officials relative to the school board
 
06:59:04.490 --> 06:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
the elected official the elected School
 
06:59:06.350 --> 06:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
Board school boards are not necessarily
 
06:59:10.190 --> 06:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
involved in adopting curriculum per se
 
06:59:11.510 --> 06:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
um most of the time
 
06:59:13.730 --> 06:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
um to the extent the school board does
 
06:59:16.548 --> 06:59:16.558 align:start position:0%
adopt its own curriculum or it's coming
 
06:59:18.650 --> 06:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
from a rise of recommendation from an
 
06:59:20.270 --> 06:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
administrator a curriculum coordinator
 
06:59:22.548 --> 06:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
or superintendent people with expertise
 
06:59:24.288 --> 06:59:24.298 align:start position:0%
and curriculum instruction and
 
06:59:24.298 --> 06:59:25.730 align:start position:0%
and curriculum instruction and
assessment

06:59:25.730 --> 06:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
06:59:27.650 --> 06:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
um so but I ultimately as the statute
 
06:59:30.708 --> 06:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
already says RSA 189 colon 1A the school
 
06:59:32.510 --> 06:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
board has that Authority and that has
 
06:59:34.310 --> 06:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
that responsibility for at least
 
06:59:36.048 --> 06:59:36.058 align:start position:0%
overseeing and the governance
 
06:59:39.350 --> 06:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility of curriculum standards
 
06:59:41.090 --> 06:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
delivery of instruction and so forth
 
06:59:42.948 --> 06:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
within their Community within their
 
06:59:44.330 --> 06:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
local community
 
06:59:48.230 --> 06:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
06:59:50.810 --> 06:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for answering my
 
06:59:50.820 --> 06:59:52.368 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for answering my
question

06:59:52.368 --> 06:59:52.378 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:59:56.270 --> 06:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm more confused now because it
 
06:59:58.788 --> 06:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
seemed when you first sat down and you
 
07:00:01.490 --> 07:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
were reading the bits it seemed like you
 
07:00:04.490 --> 07:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
were saying that these school board was
 
07:00:07.010 --> 07:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
responsible for how the things were done
 
07:00:08.690 --> 07:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:00:13.250 --> 07:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
how it was taught whatever and that the
 
07:00:15.350 --> 07:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and above
 
07:00:18.530 --> 07:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
that the legislature was responsible for
 
07:00:18.540 --> 07:00:20.110 align:start position:0%
that the legislature was responsible for
the

07:00:20.110 --> 07:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:00:23.628 --> 07:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
topics the the what was to be taught in
 
07:00:25.548 --> 07:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
the school board was to determine how it
 
07:00:29.208 --> 07:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
was to be taught but this bill is a what
 
07:00:31.730 --> 07:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
to be taught not a how to be taught so
 
07:00:34.310 --> 07:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what your objection is sure
 
07:00:35.330 --> 07:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
07:00:37.070 --> 07:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative I'll try and clarify to
 
07:00:39.830 --> 07:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
the extent that I may have been unclear
 
07:00:43.310 --> 07:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
um I'll read again RSA 189 colon 1-8 and
 
07:00:45.288 --> 07:00:45.298 align:start position:0%
I'll work from there elected school
 
07:00:46.968 --> 07:00:46.978 align:start position:0%
boards shall be responsible for
 
07:00:48.170 --> 07:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
establishing the structure
 
07:00:50.990 --> 07:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
accountability advocacy and delivery of
 
07:00:53.330 --> 07:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
instruction in each School operated and
 
07:00:55.128 --> 07:00:55.138 align:start position:0%
governed in its District
 
07:00:57.410 --> 07:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
to accomplish this end and to support
 
07:00:59.208 --> 07:00:59.218 align:start position:0%
flexibility in implementing diverse
 
07:01:01.310 --> 07:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
educational approaches school boards
 
07:01:03.230 --> 07:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
shall establish in each School operated
 
07:01:04.330 --> 07:01:04.340 align:start position:0%
and governed in its District
 
07:01:06.650 --> 07:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
instructional policies and established
 
07:01:08.628 --> 07:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
instructional goals based upon available
 
07:01:10.968 --> 07:01:10.978 align:start position:0%
information about the Knowledge and
 
07:01:12.650 --> 07:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
Skills pupils will need in the future
 
07:01:14.930 --> 07:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
that's the School Board responsibility
 
07:01:18.468 --> 07:01:18.478 align:start position:0%
I'm going to jump over to RSA 193-e the
 
07:01:20.810 --> 07:01:20.820 align:start position:0%
adequate education statute and I'm not
 
07:01:21.770 --> 07:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
going to read the whole thing this one
 
07:01:24.708 --> 07:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
gets very long but the the legislature
 
07:01:27.048 --> 07:01:27.058 align:start position:0%
in response to Claremont in response to
 
07:01:28.788 --> 07:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
its constitutional obligations and
 
07:01:31.010 --> 07:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandates under Claremont
 
07:01:35.410 --> 07:01:35.420 align:start position:0%

legislature has defined what a

constitutionally adequate education is
 
07:02:10.190 --> 07:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's these I guess 11 Provisions found

in that statute that I just cited
 
07:02:16.128 --> 07:02:16.138 align:start position:0%
I'm also going to jump up to
 
07:02:18.250 --> 07:02:18.260 align:start position:0%
um uh RSA

193-e colon 1 paragraph two respecting
 
07:02:24.230 --> 07:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's long tradition of
 
07:02:26.208 --> 07:02:26.218 align:start position:0%
community involvement it is the purpose
 
07:02:27.890 --> 07:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
of this chapter to ensure that
 
07:02:29.510 --> 07:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate means are established to
 
07:02:31.968 --> 07:02:31.978 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate education through an
 
07:02:33.650 --> 07:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
integrated system of shared
 
07:02:35.930 --> 07:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility between state and local
 
07:02:38.090 --> 07:02:38.100 align:start position:0%
government in this system the state
 
07:02:40.190 --> 07:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
establishes the minimum standards the 11
 
07:02:42.948 --> 07:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
criteria that I just read and the
 
07:02:44.990 --> 07:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
minimum standard ZD 306 that are being
 
07:02:46.368 --> 07:02:46.378 align:start position:0%
under revision from the state board
 
07:02:49.788 --> 07:02:49.798 align:start position:0%
right now for public school and academic
 
07:02:52.368 --> 07:02:52.378 align:start position:0%
standards for inclusion and okay I'm
 
07:02:54.170 --> 07:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
sorry in this system the state
 
07:02:56.448 --> 07:02:56.458 align:start position:0%
establishes minimum standards for public
 
07:02:58.250 --> 07:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
school approval and academic standards
 
07:03:00.170 --> 07:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
for inclusion and delivery of
 
07:03:02.448 --> 07:03:02.458 align:start position:0%
educational services to the local level
 
07:03:04.010 --> 07:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
school districts then have the
 
07:03:06.230 --> 07:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility and flexibility in
 
07:03:07.610 --> 07:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
implementing diverse educational
 
07:03:10.128 --> 07:03:10.138 align:start position:0%
approaches to instruction and curriculum
 
07:03:12.048 --> 07:03:12.058 align:start position:0%
tailored to meet the needs of students
 
07:03:15.288 --> 07:03:15.298 align:start position:0%
so From nhsba's perspective the state
 
07:03:17.628 --> 07:03:17.638 align:start position:0%
has an obligation a constitutional
 
07:03:20.690 --> 07:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
obligation per Claremont to establish
 
07:03:23.150 --> 07:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
and Define inadequate education we've
 
07:03:26.628 --> 07:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
done that in 193 e2a the minimum
 
07:03:28.368 --> 07:03:28.378 align:start position:0%
standards fill in the gaps how many
 
07:03:31.730 --> 07:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
credits for for for for graduation What
 
07:03:33.590 --> 07:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
policies a school board has to adopt
 
07:03:36.708 --> 07:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
relative to its its obligation under the
 
07:03:37.910 --> 07:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
07:03:40.788 --> 07:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
approval and to some degree some
 
07:03:42.650 --> 07:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
criteria relative to what your
 
07:03:44.690 --> 07:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
mathematics program has to have what
 
07:03:46.430 --> 07:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
your world language program has to have
 
07:03:50.448 --> 07:03:50.458 align:start position:0%
however within that traditionally in New
 
07:03:52.548 --> 07:03:52.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anyway the local school boards
 
07:03:55.128 --> 07:03:55.138 align:start position:0%
have been free to the local school
 
07:03:56.390 --> 07:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
districts I should say through
 
07:03:58.250 --> 07:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
collaboration between administrators and
 
07:04:00.048 --> 07:04:00.058 align:start position:0%
school boards to select their own
 
07:04:02.330 --> 07:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
curriculum to select their criteria to
 
07:04:04.368 --> 07:04:04.378 align:start position:0%
select their grading mechanism to select
 
07:04:06.468 --> 07:04:06.478 align:start position:0%
their competency standards so on and so
 
07:04:09.110 --> 07:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
forth so and and just to be clear as I
 
07:04:11.628 --> 07:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
said the the content of what's in here
 
07:04:14.090 --> 07:04:14.100 align:start position:0%
great you know we wish our our kids
 
07:04:16.190 --> 07:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
could learn all about all of this the
 
07:04:17.990 --> 07:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
other thing too we remember there's 180
 
07:04:20.090 --> 07:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
days of instructional time and the list
 
07:04:23.030 --> 07:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
of things being added to RSA 189 gets
 
07:04:25.430 --> 07:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
longer and longer every year and we've
 
07:04:26.990 --> 07:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
got to find time to teach that not that
 
07:04:29.810 --> 07:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
it isn't worthy but nhsba's position is
 
07:04:31.670 --> 07:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
that the state sort of sets the minimum
 
07:04:34.010 --> 07:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
standards and defines the criteria for
 
07:04:35.868 --> 07:04:35.878 align:start position:0%
an adequate education and then the local
 
07:04:38.330 --> 07:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
school boards have the flexibility to
 
07:04:40.310 --> 07:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
implement that via their own curricular
 
07:04:43.250 --> 07:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
options standards grading so on and so
 
07:04:43.260 --> 07:04:45.708 align:start position:0%
options standards grading so on and so
forth

07:04:45.708 --> 07:04:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:48.350 --> 07:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
further questions represent cordelli
 
07:04:50.270 --> 07:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
07:04:52.310 --> 07:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
Barrett for being here
 
07:04:54.230 --> 07:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
um based on
 
07:04:57.948 --> 07:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
um your statements just now in terms of
 
07:05:01.070 --> 07:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
um 189 versus 193e
 
07:05:03.708 --> 07:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
et cetera would
 
07:05:05.510 --> 07:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
um the school boards Association
 
07:05:08.830 --> 07:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
position be that the
 
07:05:11.570 --> 07:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
language added several years ago in
 
07:05:14.330 --> 07:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
relation to the Holocaust and genocide
 
07:05:17.170 --> 07:05:17.180 align:start position:0%
in 189
 
07:05:17.180 --> 07:05:18.788 align:start position:0%
in 189
was

07:05:18.788 --> 07:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
was
 
07:05:23.628 --> 07:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
incorrectly placed in 189 and would have
 
07:05:26.628 --> 07:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
would would oppose it now as uh it
 
07:05:29.030 --> 07:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
should be in 193e sir thank you very
 
07:05:31.010 --> 07:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
much for the question representative I
 
07:05:32.930 --> 07:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
know I I I'd have to go back and look
 
07:05:34.490 --> 07:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
and see what our position was on that
 
07:05:37.190 --> 07:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
bill I think we signed an opposition
 
07:05:38.690 --> 07:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
um again don't quote me on it I have to
 
07:05:39.890 --> 07:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
go back and look but I think our
 
07:05:41.628 --> 07:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
argument was essentially the same that
 
07:05:43.670 --> 07:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know these things should not be the
 
07:05:45.410 --> 07:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
state should not be dictating to Local
 
07:05:47.690 --> 07:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
School District specific curricular
 
07:05:50.150 --> 07:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
components if you are going to do that
 
07:05:52.128 --> 07:05:52.138 align:start position:0%
nhsba as I said it would be more
 
07:05:54.708 --> 07:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
palatable if it were in 193e and then
 
07:05:56.448 --> 07:05:56.458 align:start position:0%
paid for by the state rather than piling
 
07:05:59.330 --> 07:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
these on in an RSA 189
 
07:06:02.150 --> 07:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to interject just for a second
 
07:06:04.610 --> 07:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
the state through the legislation that
 
07:06:07.730 --> 07:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
we passed did put the Holocaust yes
 
07:06:12.468 --> 07:06:12.478 align:start position:0%
right into 193 e to a under substant
 
07:06:14.570 --> 07:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
education content of an adequate
 
07:06:16.968 --> 07:06:16.978 align:start position:0%
education it says social studies
 
07:06:18.948 --> 07:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
including civics government economics
 
07:06:21.110 --> 07:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
geography history and Holocaust and
 
07:06:23.990 --> 07:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
genocide education okay guys we did that
 
07:06:26.570 --> 07:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
last year oh and I see it also is if I'm
 
07:06:29.030 --> 07:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
if I'm a chairman LED representative
 
07:06:31.850 --> 07:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
Cordell it's also still an RSA 18911 as
 
07:06:34.910 --> 07:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
well too so it's in both places now
 
07:06:37.368 --> 07:06:37.378 align:start position:0%
I was not aware of that I thought it was
 
07:06:40.128 --> 07:06:40.138 align:start position:0%
only in 189. no it's under adequacy yeah
 
07:06:40.138 --> 07:06:42.048 align:start position:0%
only in 189. no it's under adequacy yeah
okay

07:06:42.048 --> 07:06:42.058 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:06:44.390 --> 07:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
further further questions
 
07:06:46.128 --> 07:06:46.138 align:start position:0%
for the school boards
 
07:06:47.448 --> 07:06:47.458 align:start position:0%
not seeing you thank you very much thank
 
07:06:48.830 --> 07:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair yep
 
07:06:50.448 --> 07:06:50.458 align:start position:0%
are there any more cards for this bill
 
07:06:55.010 --> 07:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:56.810 --> 07:06:56.820 align:start position:0%
and that takes us through the hearing
 
07:06:59.448 --> 07:06:59.458 align:start position:0%
bills for today I would like to have a
 
07:07:02.030 --> 07:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
caucus of the Republicans here following
 
07:07:06.110 --> 07:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:08.150 --> 07:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
I don't coffee
 
07:07:08.160 --> 07:07:10.940 align:start position:0%
