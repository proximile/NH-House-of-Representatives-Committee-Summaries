oh these
 
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
testing

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:45.110 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.760 --> 00:04:28.590 align:start position:0%
 
mic

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:28.600 --> 00:08:28.230 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:10:33.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
so terms let me try that again we'll
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing uh for the
 
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.750 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing uh for the
Commerce

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
Commerce
 
00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
Committee um you will notice that you
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
all have we all have these um
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
microphones in front of us and which
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
there's a a button to to press it to
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
speak and evidently only three three
 
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
buttons can be on at any moment so so
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
there will that will somehow cut out um
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday I tuned into the Senate uh
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee public
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
hearing and notice that uh the same
 
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
mistake was just made the chair didn't
 
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
turn on the microphone to start the
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
hearing uh and second is um that be sure
 
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:20.839 align:start position:0%
to turn off your
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
microphone uh and and I now learned that
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
I have a mute button let's try the mute
 
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
button so my mic still works with the
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
mute button
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't I don't know how this
 
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
works but just remember after the public
 
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
hearing the this mic still might be on
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
so be conscious of the little side
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
conversations U you don't want to say
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
something off mic and then have it show
 
00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:47.750 align:start position:0%
something off mic and then have it show
up

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
and the rest what it called in-depth
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
what is that new
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
s we don't want to be we don't want to
 
00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
be there again so okay um so I uh this
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
is my build so I am going to hand the CH
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
the gavl over to the vice chair you want
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
me to call the no we don't we don't
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
care we don't care it's nice that you
 
00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:10.790 align:start position:0%
care we don't care it's nice that you
have

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:54.189 align:start position:0%
 
off

00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and uh members
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
of the Commerce Committee I am
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative hunt represent ing ring
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
and Fitz
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
William uh today I'm introducing um
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
1039 um House Bill 1039 uh was a uh
 
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
resolution of a bill that we passed last
 
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
year or the year
 
00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
before time gets a little fuzzy with Co
 
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:24.519 align:start position:0%
um in which it was related to a beverage
 
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturing um having a second
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
location um it's some of you might
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
remember we did pass this similar
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
legislation for wine a couple years
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
ago and at that time one of the push uh
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
points was uh did a did someone who is
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
making wine have
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
to um manufacture wine in that extra
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
location which you know in the case if
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
you were they were to do it in an outlet
 
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
type environment it might be kind of
 
00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:58.519 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for them to be making wine
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
or beer or something in a in a shopping
 
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.150 align:start position:0%
or beer or something in a in a shopping
mall

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
mall
 
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
um at that time the the the wine people
 
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
were given the exemption that that they
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
could have that second
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
location uh without having to
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
manufacture when we pass the legislation
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
the language that was amended by the
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
Senate so it's not our fault um we just
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
left it as it is and nobody pointed out
 
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
to us that this could have been a
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
problem but then uh the department uh
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
the commission did tried to implement it
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
and they were unsure about it it was uh
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
later resolved by the Attorney General's
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
office so we would just want to clarifi
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
this amendment was to clarify it once
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
and for all so we can still discuss
 
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
whether we want to still go forward with
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
just this language or whether we'll hang
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
our hat on the AG's opinion having said
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
that uh the department um and because I
 
00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
this was a even though it doesn't say
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
Department request it was a sort of a
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
housekeeping measure to resolve that
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
issue um we have two other issues that
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
the department has come up with and they
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
will introduce to you um I am in support
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
of both of these issues um I do see them
 
00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:13.189 align:start position:0%
of both of these issues um I do see them
as

00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
housekeeping um and ensuring that our
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
laws are are are well addressed U but um
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll let them introduce those
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
amendments to you all and with that I
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
will end my
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
testimony uh thank you representative on
 
00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:32.759 align:start position:0%
yes representative Barlett thank you Mr
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
chair um M I'm just a little bit
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
confused about what the AG's um
 
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
determination was the determination was
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
that they would not have to manufacture
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
in that second Outlet thank
 
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.240 align:start position:0%
you any more
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
questions U thank you representative
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
hunt I have one pink card uh from uh Mr
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
armaganian who supports the bill do you
 
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
speak you want to yeah why don't I
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
because I could introduce maybe the the
 
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:33.230 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay um so it is there's two
 
00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
um uh maybe this is right was it so back
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
in 2003 and I don't actually remember
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
this because I was probably around doing
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
2003 I see here is 2003 that in our
 
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.030 align:start position:0%
2003 I see here is 2003 that in our
wisdom

00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
wisdom
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
multi-year not sure I guess we could we
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
could this would be a good project for
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
Kristen to go back and and pull out
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
exactly what was the reasoning behind
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
our deciding to have a multi-year
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
license however um and you'll certainly
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
hear more about it when we finally do
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
get to hear the other Bill 1591 but um
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
the audit uh that that The Liquor
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
Commission went through pointed out that
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
since no none of these multi-year
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
licenses were ever issued why are you
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
keeping it on your
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
statute so uh that we can do a little
 
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
homework on figuring out why it was
 
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
passed in the first place and then
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
whether they're right that we should
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
just take and remove it um maybe it's
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
the Department is supposed to or the
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
commission is supposed to be promoting
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
it more that they can you can get your
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
license for multi-year but I'm pretty
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
sure most lenses um only like to write a
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
check they're more willing to write a
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
check every year rather than one big fat
 
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
check every two to three years but so
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's what the first section is
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
and the second section um is uh
 
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
addressing um my my favorite law near
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
and dear to my heart is the direct
 
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.270 align:start position:0%
and dear to my heart is the direct
shipping

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
shipping
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
law and um the direct shipping law it
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
has a statute and related to the
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
carriers which is going to be UPS and
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
FedEx and in it um
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
and I and I have to admit again I don't
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
remember exactly why we put in this U
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
90day period it I believe the way my
 
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
memory was that if you if you were a bad
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
boy then you were going to be cut off
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
for 90 days but we're assuming that
 
00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:48.039 align:start position:0%
within that 90 days you would have uh
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
done whatever you needed to do to U
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
correct the pay your taxes and evidently
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
we're finding that some don't and so we
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that they don't
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
think that after 90 days they can
 
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
suddenly ship again and still not pay
 
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
the fine so uh we that that's why they
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
want to remove that 90day
 
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
period thank you represent
 
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.750 align:start position:0%
period thank you represent
representative

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
Bartlett thank you Mr chair um is it a
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
little unusual for us to be looking at
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment that's been um printed out
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
by The Liquor Commission and not through
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
right so this is something yeah in other
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
words I the subcommittee has to take
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
this in and
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
decide whether they want and change the
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
language exactly this is just a
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
narrative this is just a narrative to
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
what what the situation is that they
 
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention A and B is that
 
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
yes it's up to us so you're just
 
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799 align:start position:0%
bringing it up just for the discussion
 
00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
just bringing it in and so that so that
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know they could have waited to
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee to bring this up but it
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
was just the fact that we um we now
 
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
found that the first issue the main
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
underlying issue of the bill probably is
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
not not necessary that I thought maybe
 
00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:58.039 align:start position:0%
it was a good idea to bring in these
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
things things at the same time so
 
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
everybody has a chance to see them and
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
hear them and okay so you're considering
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can I follow up thank you um
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
so you're considering um all of what's
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
in 1039 to be housekeeping is that
 
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
correct 1039 was absolutely housekeeping
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
so there's no big changes as far as how
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
things operate no and and just
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
clarification and the same thing with
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
these two two amendments to me this is
 
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.149 align:start position:0%
these two two amendments to me this is
all

00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
housekeeping representative
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
Terry what I do do I have to hold this
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
down okay it's on until it's off yeah
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
it's on uh representative hunt uh with
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
respect to the indication that language
 
00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
to be removed is struck through would
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
you just clarify for me um in section
 
00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
two within a 90-day period is underlined
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
but it's not struck through uh uh was
 
00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:53.559 align:start position:0%
that supposed to be struck through or
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
are you arguing for retention of that
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
language I thought you were you were
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
arguing excuse me are making the case
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
for eliminating within a 90-day period
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
but it's only underlying but it's not
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
struck through okay so if you look to
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
page it struck
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
through so so the first page is the
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
narrative the first page is the
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
narrative and then the second page is
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
the actual way the the if we were to
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
make up an amendment that's what the
 
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
needs to look like thank
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
you representative Weston thanks while
 
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about striking things true
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
through uh the first line um on 178
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
colon 23 you should probably strike
 
00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:48.039 align:start position:0%
through and multiple Year from the
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
heading because it'll just be a seasonal
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
license right just thought I'd bring
 
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.789 align:start position:0%
license right just thought I'd bring
that

00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
up well address that in subcommittee
 
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.070 align:start position:0%
up well address that in subcommittee

address this to answer your question
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
specifically in 2021 the uh direct
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
shipping program uh has become immensely
 
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
popular um with our out of state uh
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
permites currently we have about
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
1363 permites licensed to the state of
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who are allowed to Direct
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
ship from their businesses out of state
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
directly to Consumers within the state
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
they do but that by the means of carrier
 
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
licenses with the carrier licenses we
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
have three carriers who deal directly
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
with the direct shipping program th
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
those are FedEx FedEx Grant found in
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
UPS under the carrier license is what
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment to the bill is before you
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
today and that in that law says that um
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's a 90day restriction on
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
businesses who have not obtained a
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
direct shipping permit who are shipping
 
00:25:18.669 --> 00:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
into the state of New
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when that happens it's
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
considered an illegal shipment right
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
they don't have a a uh permit to ship
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
directly into the state those
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
occurrences are are happening last year
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
we um had
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
154,50 shipments into the state of New
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 1510 of those were considered
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
illegal shipments our internal processes
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
when that
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
happens when illegal shipment the first
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
illegal shipment is made into the state
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
we send that business a letter a letter
 
00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
in consistent with our education process
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
in bringing the licenses into compliance
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
or businesses into compliance we Explain
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
the law to them we encourage them to get
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
a direct shipping permit if they ship
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
again then they're put on this 90-day
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
list the 90day list is updated every
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
month at the first of the month and
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
redistribute it out to all of the
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
carriers that tells the carriers the
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
businesses throughout the country that
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
are pro they're prohibited from
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
delivering those products to the
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
residences okay so they they send
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
products back to the
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
businesses after those 90 days they come
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
off of that list so businesses
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
throughout the country have figured out
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
that exactly at 90 days they're going to
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
come off the list and there's no
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
consequences to them so they will ship
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
2550 packages every Christmas season
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
know that they're going to get put on
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
the 90day list wait the three months and
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
do it again the next year and that is
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
circumventing all of the the laws that
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
we put in place to prohibit this from
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
happening now The Logical question there
 
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
is how much revenue is being lost from
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
this we simply don't have that answer
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
because we don't know what was shipped
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
we only know the carrier reports that we
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
receive on the packages that are being
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
delivered not what's in there the 8% fee
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
that is charged to the direct shippers
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
is based on how a retail value so how
 
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
many bottles are being sold directly to
 
00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.990 align:start position:0%
many bottles are being sold directly to
that

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
consumer uh I have a question on on the
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
on the Direct ship is there a you said a
 
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of their
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
uh cases bottles whatever is what 8%
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
that is the fee yes so we we charge
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
8% tax or a fee is called in statute um
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
on the retail value of what they're
 
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.509 align:start position:0%
on the retail value of what they're
shipping

00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:58.519 align:start position:0%
shipping
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
so if they ship a uh bottle for $10 it's
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
cost them 80 cost them 80 cents okay
 
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
that's that that was my question because
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
I tried to order something uh from a a
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
place in
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
Arizona uh and they said they couldn't
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
ship to New Hampshire so if I know what
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
this is then I can relay that
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
information to them so they can exp you
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
know expand their base into to New
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you guys will get some
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
revenue for it absolutely so thank you
 
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.310 align:start position:0%
revenue for it absolutely so thank you
very

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.070 align:start position:0%
very
much

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
okay representative representative Terry
 
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh sir how is it that you ascertain um
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
what and how
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
much uh is
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
um is shipped into the state either
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
legally or illegally so thank you for
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
the question do do you get reports from
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
FedEx and yes so so they they affect and
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
what kind of therefore what kind of a a
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
formal relationship do you have with uh
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
FedEx and and UPS to in effect um report
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
to you what what they're doing so by law
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question by law
 
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
they're required both the carriers and
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
the direct shippers by the 15th of the
 
00:29:14.909 --> 00:29:14.919 align:start position:0%
month are required to report to us the
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
carriers report what they've delivered
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
the direct shippers report what they've
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
shipped those reports are reconciled so
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
we can tell off of the direct or the
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
carrier report what has been delivered
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
without being shipped that's how we
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.159 --> 00:29:39.149 align:start position:0%
 
shipments

00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
shipments
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
repres just a question for the record
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
would could you state your name in
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
position again just so I can absolutely
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
I apologize for that Matthew Culver I'm
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant for administrative
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
services within New Hampshire Liquor
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
Commission division of enforcement and
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
Licensing thank you anyone else else
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
couple quick questions so as I
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
understand it the the shipper UPS is not
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
held responsible at
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
all they just have to do the reporting
 
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
but they they don't lose the ability to
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
ship so the UPS FedEx or FedEx ground
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
are the carriers right and the carriers
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
if they make a delivery of a package
 
00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:27.799 align:start position:0%
that is on that list
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh the administrative fine for that is
 
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.870 align:start position:0%
uh the administrative fine for that is
$100

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
$100
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
so that's how they're held accountable
 
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.230 align:start position:0%
so that's how they're held accountable
for

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
that U second question so I get a uh a
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
shipment of of six bottles of wine from
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
the Wall Street Wine folks um that comes
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
under this and the shipper has to notify
 
00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
that they shipped it to my address
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
correct okay all right thank you yes on
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis those reports include
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
the carrier reports include the
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
addresses of where they're delivering
 
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.950 align:start position:0%
addresses of where they're delivering
this

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
product so um um at the risk of getting
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
down too much into the weeds here for
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
everybody uh you receive or you
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
you if if if a if your department
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
determines that a shipment was made
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
illegally do you on a periodic basis
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
notify the
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
shippers who those illegal shipper the
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
shippers are who are making illegal
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
shipments then should I stop there am I
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
correct so far yes so so then if UPS or
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
FedEx continues to ship and you
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
ascertain that they shipped even once
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
they have been notified that the shipper
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
is shipping illegally then you are able
 
00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
to hold the shipper liable for that and
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
to find the shipper that is correct now
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
so if I might with an
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
example you you you spoke about
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
Christmas once a year so you would uh
 
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
you they would not know that in advance
 
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
because the shipper is not on the list
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
yet so if if you you determine that a
 
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
Christmas shipment was shipped
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
illegally then you notify FedEx and
 
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
UPS and then do they then know that that
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh restriction is in effect for 90 days
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
only yes the carriers would but I I
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
think there might be some confusion
 
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
still on the process of thank you um and
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the question uh so
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
the the carriers when a shipment is made
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
and delivered by the carrier and in that
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
shipment the based on the reports are
 
00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
due to the commission by the 15 15 of
 
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
the month so at the 15th of the month is
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
when we do that reconcile uh reconciling
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
between the reports and identify what
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
illegal shipments are made if an illegal
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
shipment is found in that we send a
 
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
letter to the Direct ship the
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
shipping the business without a permit I
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
guess is the best way to explain it the
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
non-licensed permitting business and we
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
explain to them that they're in
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
violation of RSA 178 one shipping
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
without a
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
license on their first offense so they
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
they're giving one chance to come back
 
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
and get and obtain a a permit with us we
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
educate them on the law we educate them
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
on being in violation of the law we
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
encourage them to get a permit through
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
the commission if they ship again then
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of each month we put
 
00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
them on the 90day list we give that list
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
to the carriers
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
the carriers have 15 days to update
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
their records and then they can no
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
longer deliver any packages that come
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
from the non-permitted uh license
 
00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.430 align:start position:0%
from the non-permitted uh license
non-permitted

00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.589 align:start position:0%
 
business

00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
check gon now thank you gentlemen for uh
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
answering our questions this morning um
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
I I see in current statute where you can
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
find the shipper if they knowingly
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
ship an illegal shipment is there any
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
attempt to collect from the the
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
unlicensed business those consider and
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question those
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
considerations have been made our only
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
alternative for a violation of 1781 is a
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
class B felony class B felony for outof
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
State businesses uh I mean provide some
 
00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:55.079 align:start position:0%
complications you're talking about
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
extradition back into the state it it is
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
um not something that has been pursued
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
time if I can add to that it has been
 
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%
pursued in the past and uh the cost
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness has come into play for the
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
amount of tax that is being um uh
 
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:21.079 align:start position:0%
reconciled at that point so we we're
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
playing against that also uh but that
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
was through a different
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.790 align:start position:0%
was through a different
Administration

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
able yes thank you
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
um to your knowledge
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
Do Most states have a
 
00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.670 align:start position:0%
Do Most states have a
similar

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
process uh those or I should say those
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
that would allow out of state shipping
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh are you fairly are you following a
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
process that's pretty pretty common in
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
the in the United
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
States thank you for the question and
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes there's many states I don't know how
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
many offhand uh that do have direct
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
shipping programs um and these are
 
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.079 align:start position:0%
consistent with that as far as the 90 uh
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
day requirement um I could definitely
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
offand okay thank you very much everyone

hearing

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
easy it's off it's on oh red is

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.520 --> 00:50:42.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:44.839 align:start position:0%
okay um so normally we would be opening
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
up the public hearing on uh
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
1591 uh unfortunately
 
00:50:54.789 --> 00:50:54.799 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor uh I did talk to him he's
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
asked that if it would be okay if we
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
moved it off because uh his co-sponsor
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
was with someone who uh got co uh the
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
other co-sponsor uh broke her leg I
 
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
guess Margie Marie hurt herself Twisted
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
her leg or something and uh so um and
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
let alone Aiden is also in quarantine
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
too so it better part of valor because I
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
was still working on the schedule uh
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
this morning yesterday morning when I
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
got the notification I was able to
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
timely uh address this issue so we will
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
be taking up um House Bill
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
1591 next Wednesday at
 
00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
10:15 um and uh hopefully we can uh get
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
through through that that bill at that
 
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
time having said that um um I am as
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
inviting anybody who uh who is here
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
today who really would like to test ify
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
and and can't be here for next week I
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
can certainly we allow that testimony
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
otherwise um you know that if you want
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
to say it in front of the sponsors what
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
you want to say uh what you know we can
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
we can certainly wait till next
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
Wednesday is there any anybody don't oh
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
we do need a card fill it out afterwards
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh you could fill out and afterwards yes
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's fine here do you need to
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
introduce the uh bill first excuse me do
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
you need to introduce the bill first um
 
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
like I say that the sponsor is not here
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
right but
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
just we're we're at this point we're
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
just opening the hearing and anybody can
 
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
testify and then okay I mean I know that
 
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
some people that ceremonies like having
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
someone in get in and introduce it I
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
think that's a total waste of time and
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
and usually the person is introducing
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't know anything about the bill
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
anyway so so why yeah no I I'm for
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
better for I've never been really to
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
pushing that that process so uh
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself please I'm Ian
 
00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
Freeman uh minister with the sh Free
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
Church I support the bill um I think
 
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission probably just
 
00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
on its own shouldn't exist but to get
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
rid of the enforcement Division I
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
certainly think is a good idea um the
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement division basically exists to
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
generate revenue for uh the state by
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
going and punishing uh business owners
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
and other people for violating whatever
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
the rules are that the division has come
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
up with adults are certainly able to
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
handle themselves when it comes to uh
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
using alcohol some of them aren't uh but
 
00:53:40.109 --> 00:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
putting those people you know under
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
criminal charges is not making their
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
lives any better it doesn't help people
 
00:53:47.549 --> 00:53:47.559 align:start position:0%
and all it does is it makes the Liquor
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
Division more of a a presence in
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
people's lives and it shouldn't be there
 
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
at all because prohibition doesn't work
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
and we learned that 100 years ago uh
 
00:53:58.789 --> 00:53:58.799 align:start position:0%
that was undone but unfortunately it
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
just changed forms and now we have
 
00:54:03.309 --> 00:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
regulation which is just prohibition by
 
00:54:05.069 --> 00:54:05.079 align:start position:0%
another name uh that's all I have to say
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
and thanks for listening I support the
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
bill good uh are you willing to take a
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
question happy to take any questions
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative bartl has a question
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so what is your
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
proposal um uh regarding do you have
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
another idea of how liquor laws should
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
be enforced I don't think they should
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
exist you don't think there should be
 
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
any laws at all regarding underage
 
00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.670 align:start position:0%
any laws at all regarding underage
drinking

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
drinking
 
00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
um has that ever stopped people from
 
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
drinking underage over serving uh again
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
I think that uh people will make their
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
own decisions in the marketplace and
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
they should be free to make those
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
choices I uh don't want to see people
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
get hurt but we already know that people
 
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
make bad decisions as is and no amount
 
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
of laws have stopped that from happening
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh when it comes to
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
alcohol so let's make people make their
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
choices and suffer whatever their
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
consequences are if they actually put
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
other people in danger then there should
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
be some sort of a prosecution I think
 
00:54:58.349 --> 00:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
that makes sense uh but otherwise you
 
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
know leave them alone isn't that the New
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way no Live Free or dying you
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
haven't heard of that okay okay thank
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
you is anybody else has a question thank
 
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
you very
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
much represent just so I can understand
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
how this would how this might play out
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
so if uh if a couple 12 year olds or 11
 
00:55:22.589 --> 00:55:22.599 align:start position:0%
year olds went into a liquor store and
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to buy a bottle of liquor
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
um and the store owner didn't want to
 
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
sell to
 
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:35.559 align:start position:0%
them um would would you have it that
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
that would be the end of it or that the
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
liquor store owner could sell to the 21
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
year olds and that would be fine well I
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
think it would depend on what and and if
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
I could just finish my question sir and
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
if if the if the case were to be that
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
the store owner or the clerk did not
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
want to sell to the tube 11 year olds or
 
00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
12 year olds or 10 year
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
olds um could there do do you see that
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
charges could be brought against the
 
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
owner of the liquor store because he
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
refused to make a sale that he would
 
00:56:09.789 --> 00:56:09.799 align:start position:0%
make to that would be made to anybody
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
else I if you could just speak to those
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
I'd be interested to see what your
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts are because I understand I
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from yeah
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
I support a free market and that also
 
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
includes people's ability to boycott uh
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
so if that store owner sold to those two
 
00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about that might
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
upset people in the community and they
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
may not want to patronize that person's
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
store so there can be consequences for
 
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
actions that don't involve state
 
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
criminal charges on the other hand if
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
you chose not to sell to those uh to
 
00:56:41.309 --> 00:56:41.319 align:start position:0%
those two kids there shouldn't of course
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
there should not be any sort of criminal
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
charges for that I think A store owner
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
should be free to discriminate on the
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
basis of whatever me U you know whether
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's age or whatever they feel like like
 
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't even be able to come in my
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
store if you're you know 12 years old or
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
whatever people should be able able to
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
make those choices and let's let the
 
00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.390 align:start position:0%
make those choices and let's let the
market

00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
decide thank you okay oh we have more
 
00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
questions more than I
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%

thank
 
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
you uh yes I have a a hypothetical
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
question so um there's an adult
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
bartender and an adult customer in a bar
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
and the adult customer is is Vis visibly
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
drunk um two choices the bartender can
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
serve him again or the individual who's
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
drunk can make that adult decision of
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
not to buy a another drink but let's
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
suppose he does and goes out and
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
immediately causes an accident whose
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
fault is that is that the bartender's
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
fault or is that the adult who is
 
00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
visibly drunk's fault it's the person
 
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
who got behind the wheels fault
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
every time so the bartender could
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
legally just keep serving this guy all
 
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
day long even though he's visibly drunk
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think that they should but I
 
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
also don't think that they should be put
 
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
in a prison cell for
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
that how about a how about a civil
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
liability further question no thank
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%

03:19:30.030 --> 03:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1502 and here from the prime

Ammon thank you Mr chair good afternoon
committee

03:19:43.229 --> 03:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:19:45.990 --> 03:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
members so the next three bills that
 
03:19:47.830 --> 03:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear are kind of similar
 
03:19:50.030 --> 03:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
and related so I think I'll put an
 
03:19:53.469 --> 03:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
introduction in in this testimony and
 
03:19:54.990 --> 03:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
kind of cover three birds with one stone
 
03:19:58.349 --> 03:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
if that's okay that's fine that's great
 
03:20:00.269 --> 03:20:00.279 align:start position:0%
so I have a little personal story I went
 
03:20:02.750 --> 03:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
to a friend's house uh recently uh for a
 
03:20:06.110 --> 03:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
housewarming party and he he printed
 
03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
something out and he gave it to me
 
03:20:10.870 --> 03:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
laminated as like a momento I think he
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
was kind of teasing me a little bit so
 
03:20:15.670 --> 03:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
on on this I don't know if you can see
 
03:20:19.349 --> 03:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
it I can pass it around uh is a QR code
 
03:20:21.990 --> 03:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
to purchase honey a jar of
 
03:20:26.070 --> 03:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
honey and this took place back in 2012
 
03:20:29.110 --> 03:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
in July so about 10 years ago
 
03:20:32.349 --> 03:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
almost and he has a picture of me buying
 
03:20:34.309 --> 03:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
the honey from him it was the first jar
 
03:20:36.590 --> 03:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
of honey that he sold bees were raised
 
03:20:40.229 --> 03:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
on his own farm and there's me with apps
 
03:20:41.910 --> 03:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
that we downloaded from the App Store
 
03:20:45.870 --> 03:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
purchasing that jar of honey for one
 
03:20:47.830 --> 03:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin and on the back he has the
 
03:20:49.670 --> 03:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
transaction information so there that
 
03:20:51.110 --> 03:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
you can look this up on the blockchain
 
03:20:53.950 --> 03:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
this this particular transaction at the
 
03:20:57.590 --> 03:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
time that jar of honey was
 
03:21:01.030 --> 03:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
$945 and one Bitcoin now is worth about
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
$44,000 so that's the most expensive jar
 
03:21:06.309 --> 03:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
of honey that I ever bought in my
 
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
life but it was it was a very uh mundane
 
03:21:10.840 --> 03:21:12.469 align:start position:0%
life but it was it was a very uh mundane
transaction

03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
03:21:13.990 --> 03:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you a little history in in
 
03:21:15.630 --> 03:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we were one of the first
 
03:21:19.229 --> 03:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
states to pass legislation in
 
03:21:21.990 --> 03:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
2017 and it came through this committee
 
03:21:25.150 --> 03:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
uh there was a study commission created
 
03:21:28.150 --> 03:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh and there was a representative from
 
03:21:30.710 --> 03:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
blockchain industry were appointed uh
 
03:21:33.070 --> 03:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
Jeremy Kaufman who owns company called
 
03:21:35.870 --> 03:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
Library out of Manchester was the
 
03:21:38.229 --> 03:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
governor hasson's appoint
 
03:21:40.630 --> 03:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
appointee uh and out of that commission
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
came a bill uh in 2017 that was signed
 
03:21:46.469 --> 03:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
into law barbaraa biggie was the vice
 
03:21:47.670 --> 03:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
chair of this committee she was the
 
03:21:49.710 --> 03:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor of that
 
03:21:53.429 --> 03:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
bill and uh that's my recollection I was
 
03:21:55.950 --> 03:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor I thought was Laura Jones
 
03:21:57.830 --> 03:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
she she had sponsored an earlier bill
 
03:22:00.189 --> 03:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
that kind of went sideways right right
 
03:22:02.309 --> 03:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
okay um but here's a picture of a
 
03:22:03.790 --> 03:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
signing ceremony with the governor it
 
03:22:06.790 --> 03:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
was kind of fun and uh Barbara biggie
 
03:22:08.229 --> 03:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to attend this she had
 
03:22:10.830 --> 03:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
another issue but there's uh Bart fouth
 
03:22:12.790 --> 03:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
who was also on this committee uh he was
 
03:22:15.110 --> 03:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
one of the co-sponsors and we signed uh
 
03:22:16.429 --> 03:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
we we held up a banner with the governor
 
03:22:19.070 --> 03:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
it said build your blockchain powered
 
03:22:21.389 --> 03:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
economy here in New Hampshire and the
 
03:22:24.030 --> 03:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
idea was to attract businesses in this
 
03:22:26.309 --> 03:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
new form of
 
03:22:28.590 --> 03:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
technology so that's a little background
 
03:22:31.229 --> 03:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
on on uh New Hampshire's history we were
 
03:22:33.870 --> 03:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
one of the first bills uh bills to pass
 
03:22:34.990 --> 03:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:22:38.750 --> 03:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
country um and since then other states
 
03:22:40.750 --> 03:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
have passed
 
03:22:43.750 --> 03:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
legislation the National
 
03:22:46.030 --> 03:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
Council on state
 
03:22:48.750 --> 03:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
legislators State legislatures they keep
 
03:22:51.150 --> 03:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
track of cryptocurrency legislation
 
03:22:53.189 --> 03:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
going back to 2017 and our bill is one
 
03:22:56.269 --> 03:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
of the first in their list as of last
 
03:22:59.870 --> 03:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
year 2021 they tracked 33 States and
 
03:23:02.910 --> 03:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico had pending legislation in
 
03:23:05.590 --> 03:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
their legislative session and 17 States
 
03:23:07.590 --> 03:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
enacted legislation or
 
03:23:11.229 --> 03:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
adopted resolutions um and most of it is
 
03:23:14.710 --> 03:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
in favor of supporting this
 
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
industry I know it's a difficult topic
 
03:23:18.910 --> 03:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
to understand I'm going to try to make
 
03:23:21.469 --> 03:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
it as simple as possible
 
03:23:25.269 --> 03:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
um the technology that was invented that
 
03:23:25.279 --> 03:23:26.389 align:start position:0%
um the technology that was invented that
supports

03:23:26.389 --> 03:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
supports
 
03:23:29.910 --> 03:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin it's a it was a uh a novel
 
03:23:33.870 --> 03:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
Innovation um and it's the idea
 
03:23:37.550 --> 03:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
around representing property rights in
 
03:23:40.510 --> 03:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
the digital space that's really if you
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
could fun if you could boil it down to
 
03:23:46.110 --> 03:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
its fundamental core it's the idea that
 
03:23:48.910 --> 03:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
a digital token that you can prove that
 
03:23:51.550 --> 03:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
you own that token uh and that token
 
03:23:53.910 --> 03:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
gets recorded in a big Ledger that
 
03:23:56.790 --> 03:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
everyone has access to and you can Pro
 
03:23:58.510 --> 03:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
you can mathematically prove that you
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
own that whatever that token
 
03:24:04.550 --> 03:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
represents and the token can represent
 
03:24:06.469 --> 03:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
different things it can represent a
 
03:24:10.389 --> 03:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
number let's say a unit of a virtual
 
03:24:12.150 --> 03:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
currency it could just a simple number
 
03:24:14.309 --> 03:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
that you have 10 of something or nine of
 
03:24:16.990 --> 03:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
something but it can also
 
03:24:19.349 --> 03:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
represent uh additional types of
 
03:24:21.309 --> 03:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
information it can represent artwork it
 
03:24:23.910 --> 03:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
can represent physical real estate it
 
03:24:26.229 --> 03:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
can represent almost anything that you
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
can apply property rights to can be app
 
03:24:33.950 --> 03:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
this technology can apply to that and my
 
03:24:36.710 --> 03:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
supposition is that most property rights
 
03:24:40.309 --> 03:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
in the future are going to be proven
 
03:24:43.469 --> 03:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
with techn techology similar to this
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
whatever that property is whether it's
 
03:24:47.670 --> 03:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
virtual whether it's in the metaverse
 
03:24:49.349 --> 03:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
that we hear a lot about or whether it's
 
03:24:53.110 --> 03:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
in the real world um so this it's it's
 
03:24:56.550 --> 03:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
not uh some might characterize Bitcoin
 
03:25:01.710 --> 03:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
as Beanie Baby fad um it it could be
 
03:25:03.510 --> 03:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
looked at that but it's a much much
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
bigger it's on the scale of an
 
03:25:07.710 --> 03:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
innovation uh similar to the internet
 
03:25:10.189 --> 03:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
how the internet has changed our lives
 
03:25:12.469 --> 03:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
this technology is being built out about
 
03:25:13.750 --> 03:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
much of the Innovation happening on the
 
03:25:17.389 --> 03:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
Internet is happening in this space um
 
03:25:21.309 --> 03:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
so that's a little background on that um
 
03:25:23.030 --> 03:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
so what's happened is different states
 
03:25:26.189 --> 03:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
have taken a position to try to attract
 
03:25:27.990 --> 03:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
not only the innovators but also the
 
03:25:30.349 --> 03:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
capital that that can be represented by
 
03:25:32.510 --> 03:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
this to their
 
03:25:35.950 --> 03:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction uh even cities have gotten
 
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
into the mix the the city of Miami um
 
03:25:42.269 --> 03:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
the mayor of the city of Miami is
 
03:25:45.550 --> 03:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
actively trying to promote innovators in
 
03:25:47.830 --> 03:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
the space to come to Miami and put their
 
03:25:51.429 --> 03:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
headquarters there the the newly the
 
03:25:54.150 --> 03:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
newly sworn in mayor of New York City
 
03:25:56.910 --> 03:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
Eric Adams who's happens to be a
 
03:25:59.630 --> 03:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
Democrat he says that he wants to
 
03:26:02.030 --> 03:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
attract Bitcoin and blockchain
 
03:26:04.389 --> 03:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
Technology to New York City and there's
 
03:26:07.389 --> 03:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
quotes in uh CNBC
 
03:26:09.790 --> 03:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
magazine uh that he says that schools
 
03:26:11.550 --> 03:26:11.560 align:start position:0%
should add cryptocurrency and blockchain
 
03:26:13.990 --> 03:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
technology to their curriculum he says
 
03:26:15.349 --> 03:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's the new way of paying for
 
03:26:17.189 --> 03:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
goods and services throughout the entire
 
03:26:18.990 --> 03:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
globe and that schools much must teach
 
03:26:21.630 --> 03:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
the technology behind it so this is not
 
03:26:23.950 --> 03:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
a partisan issue this is you know people
 
03:26:25.990 --> 03:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
that are Forward Thinking are interested
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
in the space uh the country recently of
 
03:26:30.750 --> 03:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
El Salvador has added Bitcoin to its
 
03:26:32.229 --> 03:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
legal tender laws which is kind of
 
03:26:34.229 --> 03:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
interesting and they're currently mining
 
03:26:36.910 --> 03:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
it with energy that they harvest from a
 
03:26:39.189 --> 03:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
from a volcano so they're using
 
03:26:41.510 --> 03:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
geothermal energy from a volcano to m
 
03:26:43.790 --> 03:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin for and they're using that for
 
03:26:45.269 --> 03:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
their uh their state
 
03:26:47.389 --> 03:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
treasury so similar laws will pass
 
03:26:51.429 --> 03:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
around the country Texas uh Nebraska but
 
03:26:54.229 --> 03:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
particularly Wyoming is way far ahead of
 
03:26:55.990 --> 03:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
us on uh
 
03:26:58.630 --> 03:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
attracting this these types of uh this
 
03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
type of Industry to their state so this
 
03:27:05.269 --> 03:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
next bill has to do with the banking
 
03:27:09.550 --> 03:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
industry so we're so I'll introduce 1502
 
03:27:11.349 --> 03:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
I should have done that at the beginning
 
03:27:13.349 --> 03:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 502 specifically deals with
 
03:27:14.429 --> 03:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
the banking
 
03:27:17.830 --> 03:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
industry and in in in summary what it
 
03:27:21.550 --> 03:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
does is it gives the banking industry um
 
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
rules around how to custody digital
 
03:27:28.150 --> 03:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
assets so that's that's really the the
 
03:27:29.590 --> 03:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
gist of it
 
03:27:33.229 --> 03:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
so um we understand like if you if you
 
03:27:34.710 --> 03:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
look at PayPal they've adopted
 
03:27:37.510 --> 03:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency if you look at other uh
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
you know Financial Services they're
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
incorporating this into their their
 
03:27:45.750 --> 03:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
platform you know this type of
 
03:27:49.110 --> 03:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
technology and this bill here would
 
03:27:51.309 --> 03:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
would provide guidance through our state
 
03:27:54.150 --> 03:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
Securities laws to the banking industry
 
03:27:55.189 --> 03:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
that if they
 
03:27:58.429 --> 03:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
custody digital assets that they have to
 
03:28:00.309 --> 03:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
follow certain rules to
 
03:28:03.670 --> 03:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
protect uh to protect consumers and uh
 
03:28:05.910 --> 03:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you know someone isn't
 
03:28:07.790 --> 03:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
defrauded of their valuable property
 
03:28:09.590 --> 03:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
that happens to be
 
03:28:13.870 --> 03:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
digital um it provides some definitions
 
03:28:17.389 --> 03:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
uh around digital assets digital
 
03:28:19.590 --> 03:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
Securities um it talks about something
 
03:28:21.469 --> 03:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
called a multi- signature agreement
 
03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
which is I won't get into what that is
 
03:28:25.590 --> 03:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
but it's basically if you think of a
 
03:28:28.670 --> 03:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
nuclear launch you need two keys to
 
03:28:31.750 --> 03:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
launch the nuclear uh missile that's
 
03:28:33.750 --> 03:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
what a multi- signature Arrangement
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
would be so you would have one key and
 
03:28:37.510 --> 03:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
you'd give another key but together
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
you'd have to jointly uh unlock
 
03:28:43.229 --> 03:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
something to make move
 
03:28:45.550 --> 03:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
it so some of the opposition I think
 
03:28:48.070 --> 03:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
we'll hear around this bill is that
 
03:28:52.110 --> 03:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
crypto is volatile and that's true it is
 
03:28:52.120 --> 03:28:53.630 align:start position:0%
crypto is volatile and that's true it is
volatile

03:28:53.630 --> 03:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
volatile
 
03:28:56.710 --> 03:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
um the total market cap of all
 
03:29:01.950 --> 03:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:04.510 --> 03:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
doll and that doesn't include things
 
03:29:06.309 --> 03:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
like non-fungible tokens which you've
 
03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
probably heard a lot about
 
03:29:11.790 --> 03:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
recently um the Bitcoin itself is about
 
03:29:14.510 --> 03:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
$800 billion market
 
03:29:17.670 --> 03:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
cap when we first introduced legislation
 
03:29:20.030 --> 03:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
around this topic years ago in this
 
03:29:23.950 --> 03:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
legislature it was it was uh seen as
 
03:29:25.670 --> 03:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
something so new it was hard to for
 
03:29:27.670 --> 03:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
people to get their heads around but you
 
03:29:29.550 --> 03:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
fast forward to today and you turn on
 
03:29:31.910 --> 03:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
CNBC or Fox Business or whatever
 
03:29:34.469 --> 03:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
Financial Network you watch and you'll
 
03:29:36.349 --> 03:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
see the price of Bitcoin quoted along
 
03:29:38.910 --> 03:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
with all the stock indexes uh as a
 
03:29:41.550 --> 03:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
matter of fact um Matt Damon has started
 
03:29:43.349 --> 03:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
doing commercials around one of the
 
03:29:45.950 --> 03:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
companies um and you know you can't get
 
03:29:49.349 --> 03:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
away from it it's becoming a much bigger
 
03:29:52.070 --> 03:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh industry and it has as I mentioned in
 
03:29:55.030 --> 03:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
the beginning it has the potential to
 
03:29:57.550 --> 03:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
affect anything that requires proof of
 
03:30:00.189 --> 03:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
property rights whether that's digital
 
03:30:05.790 --> 03:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
or physical so that's a big umbrella of
 
03:30:05.800 --> 03:30:08.910 align:start position:0%
or physical so that's a big umbrella of
potentiality

03:30:08.910 --> 03:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:12.110 --> 03:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that's about it for now I
 
03:30:13.990 --> 03:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
probably have a few more points as we
 
03:30:16.349 --> 03:30:16.359 align:start position:0%
introduce the the further bills but this
 
03:30:22.349 --> 03:30:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:25.229 --> 03:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
154 they both deal with similar issues
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
around the rules of coding a digital
 
03:30:32.030 --> 03:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
asset so if if you hand someone let's
 
03:30:33.750 --> 03:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
say it's a Mona Lisa a very expensive
 
03:30:36.349 --> 03:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
piece of art and you you don't want to
 
03:30:37.590 --> 03:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
keep it in your home you want to give it
 
03:30:39.950 --> 03:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
to someone to safeguard for you it would
 
03:30:42.150 --> 03:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
be the rules around how to safeguard
 
03:30:45.189 --> 03:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
that that that expensive piece of
 
03:30:46.750 --> 03:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
property that's what this bill deals
 
03:30:48.469 --> 03:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
with and it applies specifically to the
 
03:30:48.479 --> 03:30:49.550 align:start position:0%
with and it applies specifically to the
banking

03:30:49.550 --> 03:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
banking
 
03:30:53.990 --> 03:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
industry and one final word um I'm open
 
03:30:56.870 --> 03:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
to amending this improving it and making
 
03:30:59.030 --> 03:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
it useful for our banking industry so
 
03:31:01.910 --> 03:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
that we can attract uh you know there's
 
03:31:04.469 --> 03:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
a saying Capital goes where it's welcome
 
03:31:05.870 --> 03:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
and this Capital can go anywhere in the
 
03:31:08.269 --> 03:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
world any nook and cranny of the world
 
03:31:10.670 --> 03:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh regardless of national boundaries
 
03:31:10.680 --> 03:31:11.670 align:start position:0%
uh regardless of national boundaries
even

03:31:11.670 --> 03:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
even
 
03:31:14.630 --> 03:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
so if we make New Hampshire a place that
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
is welcoming to this Capital but not
 
03:31:18.309 --> 03:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
only the capital The Innovation the
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
people that are thinking of new
 
03:31:22.910 --> 03:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
innovative ways to build products and
 
03:31:26.229 --> 03:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
services around this we we have a an
 
03:31:28.510 --> 03:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity a brief opportunity to make
 
03:31:30.630 --> 03:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire one of the places that
 
03:31:34.229 --> 03:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
people uh might want to come to um so
 
03:31:37.790 --> 03:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:43.189 --> 03:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
questions questions yes repr me uh yes
 
03:31:45.870 --> 03:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
uh who who wrote these bills did you
 
03:31:48.150 --> 03:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
write these yourself or these sort of
 
03:31:50.229 --> 03:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
cookie cutters that have been presented
 
03:31:52.710 --> 03:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
at yeah so I I make a $100 a year I
 
03:31:54.510 --> 03:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a staff and I'm not an expert
 
03:31:58.469 --> 03:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
in in this so I I I borrowed these from
 
03:32:00.710 --> 03:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
Wyoming with the blessing of the Prime
 
03:32:02.910 --> 03:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor that sponsored these in Wyoming
 
03:32:05.189 --> 03:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
okay and his name is Tyler lindome he's
 
03:32:07.229 --> 03:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
a State Rep a former State Rep in
 
03:32:10.389 --> 03:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
Wyoming he's now currently Lumis out of
 
03:32:10.399 --> 03:32:13.389 align:start position:0%
Wyoming he's now currently Lumis out of
Wyoming

03:32:13.389 --> 03:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
in and Senator Lumis is a big uh crypto
 
03:32:19.189 --> 03:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
advocate in the US Senate she's part of
 
03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
I her along with um the senator from uh
 
03:32:25.510 --> 03:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
Kristen Cinema the two of them are uh
 
03:32:27.790 --> 03:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
big proponents of this industry in DC
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
but the prime sponsor was Tyler lindol
 
03:32:32.389 --> 03:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
and they had a big team in Wyoming
 
03:32:34.750 --> 03:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
working around this and uh it was
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:41.670 --> 03:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
that representative able
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you representative amen and
 
03:32:50.590 --> 03:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for uh your Clarity in uh
 
03:32:55.030 --> 03:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
in what you just said um my question
 
03:32:58.229 --> 03:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
is uh there actually could be so many
 
03:33:04.309 --> 03:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
but uh what is this what is the status
 
03:33:08.469 --> 03:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
currently of digital Assets in New
 
03:33:12.150 --> 03:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire AB you know absent this law
 
03:33:15.070 --> 03:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
and how would that how would that change
 
03:33:17.830 --> 03:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
if this law were enacted that we passed
 
03:33:22.670 --> 03:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
Fair hands off uh only uh consumer
 
03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:27.910 align:start position:0%
Fair hands off uh only uh consumer
protection

03:33:27.910 --> 03:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
protection
 
03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
applied um so this would
 
03:33:35.389 --> 03:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
ground you know in the last four years
 
03:33:38.510 --> 03:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
I've seen our lazy Fair attitude has
 
03:33:40.269 --> 03:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
caused companies in the space who are
 
03:33:42.189 --> 03:33:42.199 align:start position:0%
used to dealing with regulations they
 
03:33:43.349 --> 03:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
they didn't know how to they don't know
 
03:33:45.950 --> 03:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
how to handle our state because other
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
states have regulations on the books and
 
03:33:51.670 --> 03:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
because our Market is sort of small um
 
03:33:53.189 --> 03:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
you know that we're kind of an
 
03:33:56.189 --> 03:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
afterthought so this would
 
03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
give some regulatory Clarity around
 
03:34:04.229 --> 03:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
financial services companies um I'll
 
03:34:06.349 --> 03:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
mention this because it's public record
 
03:34:07.830 --> 03:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know New Hampshire we have really
 
03:34:10.750 --> 03:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
solid trust laws we kind of like the
 
03:34:13.630 --> 03:34:13.640 align:start position:0%
Forerunner of really tight trust laws
 
03:34:15.990 --> 03:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's a company called blockfi you've
 
03:34:17.269 --> 03:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
probably heard of coinbase right
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
coinbase is uh they they went public
 
03:34:23.229 --> 03:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
they had their IPO last
 
03:34:26.950 --> 03:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
year uh on the US Stock
 
03:34:30.670 --> 03:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
Market um and they're I think a 62
 
03:34:34.830 --> 03:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
billion doll market cap is I
 
03:34:37.269 --> 03:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
think they're based in California if I
 
03:34:39.389 --> 03:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
believe there's other companies in the
 
03:34:41.189 --> 03:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
space there's one called block
 
03:34:45.630 --> 03:34:45.640 align:start position:0%
and blockfi has different uh uh crypto
 
03:34:47.550 --> 03:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
offerings uh you can get a credit card
 
03:34:49.349 --> 03:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
if you go out to dinner you can earn
 
03:34:52.349 --> 03:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
crypto as like a cash back reward for
 
03:34:54.870 --> 03:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
your purchase so
 
03:34:58.269 --> 03:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
blockfi in new earlier 2021 they filed
 
03:35:01.469 --> 03:35:01.479 align:start position:0%
with our banking department for a Trust
 
03:35:03.990 --> 03:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
Company in New Hampshire but they they
 
03:35:05.790 --> 03:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
pulled it I believe it was in September
 
03:35:07.469 --> 03:35:07.479 align:start position:0%
so they they came in they were going to
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
use our trust laws and then they they
 
03:35:11.110 --> 03:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
went out I don't know the reason for
 
03:35:12.830 --> 03:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
that it was it's that's all confidential
 
03:35:14.910 --> 03:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think I'll ever know but there's
 
03:35:16.750 --> 03:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
an example of a pretty big company in
 
03:35:19.349 --> 03:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
that in that space that was tipping
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
their toe in the water for New Hampshire
 
03:35:24.269 --> 03:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
and somehow got scared off so if we
 
03:35:26.429 --> 03:35:26.439 align:start position:0%
could fix that problem with legislation
 
03:35:34.229 --> 03:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:37.110 --> 03:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
Juris I could I could Ramble On stop me
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
if I'm talking too much um in talking to
 
03:35:42.630 --> 03:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
Tyler uh their banking department they
 
03:35:44.389 --> 03:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
helped push these bills through and and
 
03:35:47.710 --> 03:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
many more their banking department is he
 
03:35:49.229 --> 03:35:49.239 align:start position:0%
says they're flush with cash because
 
03:35:51.070 --> 03:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
they have annual filings every year from
 
03:35:52.590 --> 03:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
lots of these companies that are
 
03:35:54.630 --> 03:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
registering and they're actually Wyoming
 
03:35:57.550 --> 03:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
is is actually become second to the
 
03:36:01.030 --> 03:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
state of Delaware for Corporate filing
 
03:36:03.469 --> 03:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
income and a lot of it has to do with
 
03:36:07.830 --> 03:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:11.309 --> 03:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
so represent M leader again uh yes
 
03:36:13.110 --> 03:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative Aman I I may have a
 
03:36:15.269 --> 03:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up question but my understanding
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
that Bitcoin is not considered a
 
03:36:20.750 --> 03:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
security what we consider a stock or a
 
03:36:24.550 --> 03:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
bond but I'm I'm looking at
 
03:36:28.750 --> 03:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh um 21-
 
03:36:31.269 --> 03:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
29 and let me read it to you digital
 
03:36:33.550 --> 03:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
Securities are in tangental personal
 
03:36:35.110 --> 03:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
property and should be considered
 
03:36:37.150 --> 03:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
Securities but then it goes on to say is
 
03:36:42.309 --> 03:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 382 etc etc but it is not
 
03:36:45.189 --> 03:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
a security per se that would be subject
 
03:36:47.670 --> 03:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
to any rules by the security Security
 
03:36:50.110 --> 03:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
and Exchange Commission is that
 
03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
correct yeah so this because there's so
 
03:36:55.630 --> 03:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
many layers to this technology space
 
03:36:58.710 --> 03:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay so uh Bitcoin is considered a
 
03:37:01.950 --> 03:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
digital digital property right and bit
 
03:37:04.030 --> 03:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
bitcoin's kind of like a you could say a
 
03:37:06.269 --> 03:37:06.279 align:start position:0%
dumb Network it all all it's a big Excel
 
03:37:08.429 --> 03:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet of who owns what that's
 
03:37:10.630 --> 03:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
basically what Bitcoin is but there
 
03:37:12.229 --> 03:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
layers on top of it something called
 
03:37:14.750 --> 03:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
smart contracts so ethereum is a smart
 
03:37:17.550 --> 03:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
contract platform and you can create all
 
03:37:21.150 --> 03:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of digital tokens that are it
 
03:37:23.030 --> 03:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's something called the Howie test
 
03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
where they there's a a question going
 
03:37:29.070 --> 03:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
back I forget was the 1940s or something
 
03:37:31.469 --> 03:37:31.479 align:start position:0%
um I forget the exact date but there's a
 
03:37:34.469 --> 03:37:34.479 align:start position:0%
test to decide whether something is a
 
03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
security or not and you can create on a
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
smart contract platform you can create
 
03:37:42.389 --> 03:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
something that looks more like a
 
03:37:47.269 --> 03:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
security so well so as as a followup um
 
03:37:50.750 --> 03:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
for example Fidelity has a digital
 
03:37:53.790 --> 03:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
currency ETF that would be considered a
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
security would that be correct the ETF
 
03:37:57.510 --> 03:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
is registered with the SEC okay all
 
03:37:59.550 --> 03:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
03:38:05.070 --> 03:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
you so um this one is the UCC
 
03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
one um and historically I've been
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
around long enough to every once in a
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
while the UCC comes down and uh that
 
03:38:19.469 --> 03:38:19.479 align:start position:0%
comes uh I think it's in Chicago where
 
03:38:21.950 --> 03:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
they they make these UC and the purpose
 
03:38:25.990 --> 03:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
of the UCC was to be uniform across the
 
03:38:29.790 --> 03:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
country and but so if this is going to
 
03:38:34.429 --> 03:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
be our own uccc form then it's not
 
03:38:36.790 --> 03:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily comes from them first words
 
03:38:38.990 --> 03:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
sort of this is the cart before the
 
03:38:41.429 --> 03:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
horse because usually we wait until they
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
have come out with their uccc which I
 
03:38:47.309 --> 03:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
think they're working on number 12 I
 
03:38:49.510 --> 03:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened to 10 11 in
 
03:38:52.110 --> 03:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
between but so number 12 was supposed to
 
03:38:54.510 --> 03:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
be this wouldn't we be better for us to
 
03:38:56.269 --> 03:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
wait until they actually come out with
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
their UCC rather than having to pass
 
03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
something and then have to repeal it and
 
03:39:05.910 --> 03:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
replace it with the new UCC
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
language um I mean there's
 
03:39:12.389 --> 03:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
philosophical things around relying on
 
03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
some third party to write our state laws
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
right so we we wouldn't want to seed our
 
03:39:19.309 --> 03:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
sovereignty there's a reason why we have
 
03:39:22.870 --> 03:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
Securities laws in in state statutes and
 
03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's the purview of the legislature to
 
03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
modify it the downside of waiting is
 
03:39:30.469 --> 03:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
that it once it's uniform or what once
 
03:39:33.030 --> 03:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government comes out with um
 
03:39:34.750 --> 03:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
it's not federal government I know it's
 
03:39:37.349 --> 03:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
not either or right and it was designed
 
03:39:39.990 --> 03:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
so that that laws wouldn't be federal
 
03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:41.030 align:start position:0%
so that that laws wouldn't be federal
laws

03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
laws
 
03:39:44.269 --> 03:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
that each state would take these model
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
UCC statutes and put them in their own
 
03:39:49.990 --> 03:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
statute so they would be consistent
 
03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
across the board so people know what the
 
03:39:53.750 --> 03:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
law is because it's consistent from
 
03:39:57.030 --> 03:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
state to state without Federal you know
 
03:39:58.750 --> 03:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
implications it was done on a state
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
level at the state level understood um I
 
03:40:03.750 --> 03:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
guess that it's do we want to have first
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
move or advantage or not I think that's
 
03:40:08.269 --> 03:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
the question and also the more states
 
03:40:10.389 --> 03:40:10.399 align:start position:0%
that adopt legislation like this would
 
03:40:13.070 --> 03:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
inform that process right they they they
 
03:40:16.590 --> 03:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
would most likely try to uh you know if
 
03:40:18.070 --> 03:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
multiple States
 
03:40:23.550 --> 03:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
had uh digital asset uh changes to their
 
03:40:25.830 --> 03:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
uccc code that they would incorporate
 
03:40:28.469 --> 03:40:28.479 align:start position:0%
those in um but it's that first mover
 
03:40:29.710 --> 03:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
Advantage you know there's a few years
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
here where uh we could we could uh move
 
03:40:36.349 --> 03:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
forward and once we attract those
 
03:40:38.150 --> 03:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
businesses that Capital those ideas you
 
03:40:40.670 --> 03:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
know those innovators it gives us
 
03:40:44.269 --> 03:40:44.279 align:start position:0%
uh benefits going forward okay so so
 
03:40:47.229 --> 03:40:47.239 align:start position:0%
Wyoming had they did change their UCC
 
03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
statute yes they did along with a few
 
03:40:52.070 --> 03:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
other states but uh Texas I think is one
 
03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
and uh so my last question is is you
 
03:40:56.910 --> 03:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
made the comparison if we had a very
 
03:40:58.630 --> 03:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
valuable painting and we wanted to have
 
03:41:00.630 --> 03:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
somebody else hold the valuable
 
03:41:02.830 --> 03:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
painting we have no state laws
 
03:41:02.840 --> 03:41:04.510 align:start position:0%
painting we have no state laws
regulating

03:41:04.510 --> 03:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
regulating
 
03:41:08.070 --> 03:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
that so that you're asking us to say to
 
03:41:10.830 --> 03:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
treat this as a I think the a member of
 
03:41:13.990 --> 03:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
the banking Department used to call uh
 
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
Beanie beanie babies is her comparison
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
so if we're treating these as special
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
assets why why should we change from
 
03:41:26.790 --> 03:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
what our current attitude which is it's
 
03:41:30.750 --> 03:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
up to those two parties involved to uh
 
03:41:33.189 --> 03:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
figure out what makes it secure what
 
03:41:35.469 --> 03:41:35.479 align:start position:0%
makes it safe rather than us getting
 
03:41:37.030 --> 03:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
involved in that transaction yeah you
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
know some of my friends are going to get
 
03:41:40.750 --> 03:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
mad at me for saying this but it's that
 
03:41:43.469 --> 03:41:43.479 align:start position:0%
the regulatory uncertainty aspect i'
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
we've seen that with what we did earlier
 
03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
on that a company that let's say like
 
03:41:50.429 --> 03:41:50.439 align:start position:0%
blockfi he wants to move from New Jersey
 
03:41:53.269 --> 03:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and they don't have
 
03:41:56.429 --> 03:41:56.439 align:start position:0%
rules around it uh you know they they
 
03:41:59.429 --> 03:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
might not know how to how to you know
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
way okay uh representative Herbert's
 
03:42:08.960 --> 03:42:12.030 align:start position:0%
way okay uh representative Herbert's
next

03:42:12.030 --> 03:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:12.040 --> 03:42:13.550 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:42:13.550 --> 03:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:42:17.429 --> 03:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
um yesterday I was watching the uh
 
03:42:19.590 --> 03:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Banking Committee uh interview
 
03:42:22.349 --> 03:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
with uh the Federal Reserve chairman
 
03:42:22.359 --> 03:42:23.269 align:start position:0%
with uh the Federal Reserve chairman
Lewis

03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
Lewis
 
03:42:27.630 --> 03:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
Powell and uh Senator
 
03:42:27.640 --> 03:42:29.389 align:start position:0%
Powell and uh Senator
Cheryl

03:42:29.389 --> 03:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
Cheryl
 
03:42:32.149 --> 03:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
Lumis who was uh in her first term I
 
03:42:33.670 --> 03:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
think she just was elected to the United
 
03:42:33.680 --> 03:42:34.550 align:start position:0%
think she just was elected to the United
States

03:42:34.550 --> 03:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
States
 
03:42:39.309 --> 03:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
Senate uh made reference to uh special
 
03:42:41.910 --> 03:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
purpose dep atory institutions that
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
Wyoming already has uh
 
03:42:47.229 --> 03:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
promulgated but she said she was
 
03:42:50.790 --> 03:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
severely disappointed in that her
 
03:42:54.309 --> 03:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
request of chairman Powell to present to
 
03:42:58.429 --> 03:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
her in the committee a regulatory
 
03:43:00.950 --> 03:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
structure uh legitimizing uh
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
cryptocurreny crypto as a
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
currency so um I could tell from the
 
03:43:13.710 --> 03:43:13.720 align:start position:0%
action of the chair that he was U not
 
03:43:13.720 --> 03:43:14.590 align:start position:0%
action of the chair that he was U not
ready

03:43:14.590 --> 03:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
ready
 
03:43:18.269 --> 03:43:18.279 align:start position:0%
to talk about it
 
03:43:22.469 --> 03:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
um I have a uh I think I have a pretty
 
03:43:24.630 --> 03:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
good understanding of what a currency
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
is so I
 
03:43:31.469 --> 03:43:31.479 align:start position:0%
uh my question to you is is the the
 
03:43:34.990 --> 03:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
ultimate aim of this legislation and I'm
 
03:43:36.870 --> 03:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
sure there will be further legislation
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
if this
 
03:43:41.870 --> 03:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
passes uh is the ultimate aim of the
 
03:43:44.269 --> 03:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
crypto currency which is which everybody
 
03:43:48.670 --> 03:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
talks about it as a currency uh will
 
03:43:52.830 --> 03:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
become uh a legitimate uh uh currency
 
03:43:57.110 --> 03:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
like the dollar uh in the United
 
03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
States yeah that that's a really big
 
03:44:02.670 --> 03:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
question to uh maybe afterwards we can
 
03:44:04.149 --> 03:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
discuss that a little further my short
 
03:44:07.469 --> 03:44:07.479 align:start position:0%
answer would be the word cryptocurrency
 
03:44:10.309 --> 03:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
is kind of a misnomer it's not it's not
 
03:44:13.070 --> 03:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
a a fiat currency a fiat currency would
 
03:44:15.510 --> 03:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
be the dollar or the Yen or the Euro
 
03:44:18.630 --> 03:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's issued by a government you know
 
03:44:22.229 --> 03:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
that this currency is based on
 
03:44:25.070 --> 03:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
mathematics currency in the in the the
 
03:44:26.590 --> 03:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
way that you can let's say you had
 
03:44:28.269 --> 03:44:28.279 align:start position:0%
marbles that people thought were
 
03:44:29.630 --> 03:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
valuable and you could trade those
 
03:44:32.309 --> 03:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
marbles right you know or or cigarettes
 
03:44:34.309 --> 03:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
in prison might be considered a currency
 
03:44:36.750 --> 03:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
right but it's not a government backed
 
03:44:40.870 --> 03:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
or issued currency it's um it's it's
 
03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's interesting the the whole process
 
03:44:44.510 --> 03:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
around Bitcoin was modeled after gold
 
03:44:47.189 --> 03:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
mining so gold is something you dig out
 
03:44:48.630 --> 03:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
of the ground takes energy to get out of
 
03:44:51.070 --> 03:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
the ground and it's you know universally
 
03:44:52.990 --> 03:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
valued and it's divisible and it doesn't
 
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
corrode it has all the characteristics
 
03:44:56.950 --> 03:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
of a currency um but it would be more
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
like gold you know it be more like
 
03:45:00.830 --> 03:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
something that people around the world
 
03:45:03.349 --> 03:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
have agreed is valuable and the reason
 
03:45:05.550 --> 03:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
that they agree it's valuable is because
 
03:45:08.590 --> 03:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
the technology behind it doesn't allow
 
03:45:11.429 --> 03:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
for um uh counterfeiting
 
03:45:14.429 --> 03:45:14.439 align:start position:0%
it so like I said I could talk for hours
 
03:45:19.349 --> 03:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
on this um but so it's it's not there's
 
03:45:22.550 --> 03:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
actually Arguments for Bitcoin um
 
03:45:25.710 --> 03:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
enhancing the US Dollar's Reserve
 
03:45:28.070 --> 03:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
currency status if it's adopted so
 
03:45:31.469 --> 03:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
there's actually longer arguments
 
03:45:35.950 --> 03:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
about uh you know if if the US shuns
 
03:45:38.910 --> 03:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin it could challenge the dollars
 
03:45:41.550 --> 03:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
US Reserve res ve status or the global
 
03:45:43.710 --> 03:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
Reserve status but if we embrace it it
 
03:45:46.590 --> 03:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
actually enhances the dollar as staying
 
03:45:48.149 --> 03:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
and competing against all the other
 
03:45:48.159 --> 03:45:49.950 align:start position:0%
and competing against all the other
currencies

03:45:49.950 --> 03:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
currencies
 
03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
so further question you
 
03:45:52.800 --> 03:45:55.429 align:start position:0%
so further question you
may

03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
may
 
03:45:58.189 --> 03:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
um I think that you know I think the the
 
03:46:00.269 --> 03:46:00.279 align:start position:0%
benefits would go to crypto more than
 
03:46:04.990 --> 03:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
um crypto currency
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
has has had one very important uh
 
03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
Financial role to play in the united in
 
03:46:17.469 --> 03:46:17.479 align:start position:0%
the world as a matter of fact okay over
 
03:46:20.229 --> 03:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
the past decade or more I'm not sure
 
03:46:21.870 --> 03:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
exactly when cryptos
 
03:46:26.309 --> 03:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
became so January 3rd 2009 is the is
 
03:46:30.950 --> 03:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
when uh since 2009 okay um it's common
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge that
 
03:46:36.550 --> 03:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh a lot of the
 
03:46:41.149 --> 03:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh illegal activity is uses the crypto
 
03:46:44.309 --> 03:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
system in order to operate and and I'm
 
03:46:47.550 --> 03:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
talking and it's in as you said the
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
trillions people don't understand
 
03:46:53.630 --> 03:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
exactly how much criminal money there is
 
03:46:56.950 --> 03:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
in the globe but it's astonishing anyway
 
03:47:01.590 --> 03:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
the um so it uh crypto
 
03:47:07.149 --> 03:47:07.159 align:start position:0%
has um been able to uh financially uh
 
03:47:09.750 --> 03:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
help uh criminal activities everything
 
03:47:14.110 --> 03:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
from weapon sales to
 
03:47:17.389 --> 03:47:17.399 align:start position:0%
um uh tax cheating
 
03:47:21.510 --> 03:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
to uh your question is yeah well it it
 
03:47:26.149 --> 03:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
has been a primary tool of uh Global
 
03:47:26.159 --> 03:47:27.950 align:start position:0%
has been a primary tool of uh Global
criminal

03:47:27.950 --> 03:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
03:47:30.750 --> 03:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
Capital that disturbs me a little bit
 
03:47:35.550 --> 03:47:35.560 align:start position:0%
that's your question my question is um
 
03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
if you associate as you want to do cryp
 
03:47:43.870 --> 03:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
to activities with the American
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
dollar uh I have I have some serious
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
concerns about that Association okay and
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
do I agree what I believe I believe that
 
03:47:55.920 --> 03:47:58.830 align:start position:0%
do I agree what I believe I believe that
um

03:47:58.830 --> 03:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
so again there's a longer answer to that
 
03:48:03.550 --> 03:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
um in the beginning governments didn't
 
03:48:05.309 --> 03:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
know how to deal with cryptocurrency but
 
03:48:07.670 --> 03:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
they're getting smarter AR around
 
03:48:09.070 --> 03:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
tracking the transactions on the
 
03:48:11.550 --> 03:48:11.560 align:start position:0%
blockchain I I showed you this earlier I
 
03:48:12.630 --> 03:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
know you can't probably see it from your
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
seat But it includes everything about
 
03:48:16.910 --> 03:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
how to find that transaction on the
 
03:48:18.830 --> 03:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
blockchain and if if you know who owns
 
03:48:22.429 --> 03:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
the key uh going in and you know who's
 
03:48:24.429 --> 03:48:24.439 align:start position:0%
the who owns the key going out then
 
03:48:25.910 --> 03:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
you're able to tie those two things
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
together um I probably have I don't know
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
five apps on my phone that I can like
 
03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
this second I could move Bitcoin to
 
03:48:34.910 --> 03:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
dollars or dollars of Bitcoin uh back
 
03:48:37.030 --> 03:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
and forth and I can send you dollars I
 
03:48:38.309 --> 03:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
can send you Bitcoin or any other
 
03:48:42.990 --> 03:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
currency it's it's already pervasive um
 
03:48:46.309 --> 03:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
everywhere the fact that like coinbase
 
03:48:48.189 --> 03:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
or some one of these exchanges you have
 
03:48:49.990 --> 03:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
to tell them who you are you have to
 
03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
give them a lot of times your ID and you
 
03:48:55.510 --> 03:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
know they have a process to verify your
 
03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
identity and then once they know your
 
03:49:00.229 --> 03:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
identity and you buy Bitcoin now they
 
03:49:02.950 --> 03:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
can t they can track those Bitcoin were
 
03:49:05.790 --> 03:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
were purchased by you at a certain date
 
03:49:09.030 --> 03:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
and time and so and so the there's it's
 
03:49:11.830 --> 03:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's actually a very transparent system
 
03:49:13.469 --> 03:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
and as governments around the world are
 
03:49:15.630 --> 03:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
getting more sophisticated with how to
 
03:49:18.550 --> 03:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
track the transactions you can actually
 
03:49:20.429 --> 03:49:20.439 align:start position:0%
track down some of these criminals and
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
it's getting it's getting easier over
 
03:49:25.870 --> 03:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
time so um having a legitimate company
 
03:49:28.830 --> 03:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
to sell you Bitcoin or to convert your
 
03:49:32.510 --> 03:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin creates a a way to see who's
 
03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
doing those transactions so that they
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
can't evade uh law enforcement or this
 
03:49:41.389 --> 03:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
is remember the dollar bill they wanted
 
03:49:43.870 --> 03:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
to solve the problem of criminals using
 
03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
the money the American cash by getting
 
03:49:49.149 --> 03:49:49.159 align:start position:0%
rid of the $100 bill and even the $20
 
03:49:52.750 --> 03:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
bill okay so I don't think it's I mean I
 
03:49:54.030 --> 03:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
understand you're asking the question
 
03:49:57.309 --> 03:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
and he gave a a decent answer to it so
 
03:49:59.110 --> 03:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
let's let's move on representative
 
03:50:02.429 --> 03:50:02.439 align:start position:0%
bar thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:50:04.110 --> 03:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
representative Amon you're um being very
 
03:50:06.590 --> 03:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
patient with us um oh was
 
03:50:10.070 --> 03:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
s um because you're you're trying trying
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
to explain a
 
03:50:16.630 --> 03:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
difficult concept to a bunch of people
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
that are Bas basically volunteers we
 
03:50:23.630 --> 03:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
aren't we aren't banking or crypto
 
03:50:26.910 --> 03:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
experts at all um so I guess that's one
 
03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
of my concerns is that though we may be
 
03:50:34.229 --> 03:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
holding the the cards as far as whether
 
03:50:37.550 --> 03:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
we approve this bill or not how do we
 
03:50:40.349 --> 03:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
get how do we get more comfortable do
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
you think maybe there'll be others
 
03:50:43.750 --> 03:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
that'll speak to us that'll continue to
 
03:50:45.469 --> 03:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
repeat because repetition is a good
 
03:50:48.309 --> 03:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
teacher oh okay I think there's some
 
03:50:51.229 --> 03:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
pros and cons coming behind me and that
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
I we learn a lot in that debate right so
 
03:50:55.590 --> 03:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
I think there'll be some of that I mean
 
03:50:57.750 --> 03:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
this is already law in in at least two
 
03:51:02.110 --> 03:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
states um Sim law or something similar
 
03:51:05.790 --> 03:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not I I wish it was the
 
03:51:07.389 --> 03:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
first and the brand you know the
 
03:51:09.469 --> 03:51:09.479 align:start position:0%
shiniest newest thing but we kind of
 
03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
playing a little bit catchup with
 
03:51:13.870 --> 03:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
legislation similar to this if you know
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of been tested already in
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
in the you know in the real world so
 
03:51:21.790 --> 03:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I I'll keep listening okay
 
03:51:24.870 --> 03:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
Terry uh in thank you in addition to uh
 
03:51:30.269 --> 03:51:30.279 align:start position:0%
what you've already shared with us um do
 
03:51:34.389 --> 03:51:34.399 align:start position:0%
do you for can you see any any um any
 
03:51:36.189 --> 03:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
risks with us
 
03:51:39.670 --> 03:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
being uh what I'll say uh either late or
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
last to the game for example waiting for
 
03:51:46.189 --> 03:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh something to come from UCC rather
 
03:51:48.510 --> 03:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
than following the lead of states such
 
03:51:51.870 --> 03:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
as Wyoming and did you say Texas Texas
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
and there's a few others so so so you
 
03:51:57.309 --> 03:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
see any risks with us not doing anything
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
and just sitting and waiting that's part
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
one of my question and part two is given
 
03:52:04.670 --> 03:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that there are now laws on the
 
03:52:07.349 --> 03:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
books and experiences in Wyoming and
 
03:52:09.630 --> 03:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
Texas have there been any
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh reviews yet as to how the laws are
 
03:52:15.870 --> 03:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
working and uh have there been any
 
03:52:17.550 --> 03:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
specific problems that need to be
 
03:52:20.309 --> 03:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
addressed as these two states have led
 
03:52:22.630 --> 03:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
the way that's a good question I think
 
03:52:25.550 --> 03:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
Texas is has it's been so recent I don't
 
03:52:28.189 --> 03:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
there's probably not much history on
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
that Wyoming Wyoming uh I've only heard
 
03:52:34.110 --> 03:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
good things from the people that uh
 
03:52:35.990 --> 03:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
sponsored this legislation in Wyoming
 
03:52:38.870 --> 03:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
there there there may be downsides to it
 
03:52:41.349 --> 03:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
um um I'm not aware of any at this point
 
03:52:43.269 --> 03:52:43.279 align:start position:0%
in time and the first part of my
 
03:52:45.710 --> 03:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
question is do you foresee any risks
 
03:52:48.990 --> 03:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
thus being uh waiting and being late or
 
03:52:52.469 --> 03:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
last so in technology and really any
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
kind of like Communications Network
 
03:52:55.349 --> 03:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
there's there's something called the
 
03:52:58.269 --> 03:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
network effect right so
 
03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
03:53:03.149 --> 03:53:03.159 align:start position:0%
you like technolog is kind of sticky if
 
03:53:05.149 --> 03:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
you like Silicon Valley is where all the
 
03:53:07.149 --> 03:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
uh entrepreneurs go and they go there
 
03:53:09.870 --> 03:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
because the that area became known for
 
03:53:12.670 --> 03:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
that uh type of innovation
 
03:53:16.990 --> 03:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
so if you wait to last they're going to
 
03:53:19.229 --> 03:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
find a home somewhere else and to get
 
03:53:21.030 --> 03:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
them to move from Wyoming or somewhere
 
03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
else and and you know put their
 
03:53:24.670 --> 03:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
headquarters in New Hampshire it's gon
 
03:53:27.110 --> 03:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
to we we'll be picking up the scraps at
 
03:53:28.510 --> 03:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
that point if we're just on a Level
 
03:53:30.189 --> 03:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
Playing Field that's the way I see I
 
03:53:32.030 --> 03:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
think there is a disadvantage in
 
03:53:34.269 --> 03:53:34.279 align:start position:0%
Waiting representative
 
03:53:36.349 --> 03:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
gon thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:53:40.830 --> 03:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon uh according to uh
 
03:53:44.670 --> 03:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1502 it says that uh Banks
 
03:53:46.710 --> 03:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to provide custodial
 
03:53:49.070 --> 03:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
services for digital asset property
 
03:53:51.790 --> 03:53:51.800 align:start position:0%
would then these Banks be subject to the
 
03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
same reporting requirements such as uh
 
03:53:57.070 --> 03:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
under the Patriot Act if you deposit
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
$10,000 that gets reported uh the newly
 
03:54:04.710 --> 03:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh imposed uh $600 in annual
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
transactions via PayPal or um Vin
 
03:54:12.830 --> 03:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
those get reported to the IRS now uh
 
03:54:14.309 --> 03:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
will this will the banks be subject to
 
03:54:15.990 --> 03:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
any kind of reporting such as that if
 
03:54:17.269 --> 03:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
there's transactions because like you
 
03:54:19.830 --> 03:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
just said one Bitcoin is over
 
03:54:22.229 --> 03:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
$40,000 uh which it's gone down about
 
03:54:24.389 --> 03:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
$9,000 in the last week since I bought
 
03:54:27.910 --> 03:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
some uh that's my fault I tanked the
 
03:54:31.790 --> 03:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
market thank you but uh what what uh
 
03:54:33.189 --> 03:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
would they be subject to those same
 
03:54:35.950 --> 03:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements uh someone more
 
03:54:38.469 --> 03:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
expert in uh the regulations around
 
03:54:39.790 --> 03:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
banking could answer better but I
 
03:54:42.030 --> 03:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
believe that's a federal requirement and
 
03:54:43.469 --> 03:54:43.479 align:start position:0%
I don't know how it applies to digital
 
03:54:45.229 --> 03:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
assets at the federal level to be honest
 
03:54:47.469 --> 03:54:47.479 align:start position:0%
with you
 
03:54:50.469 --> 03:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
um yeah the the Bitcoin roller coaster
 
03:54:53.269 --> 03:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
guy is like a meme on the internet that
 
03:54:55.389 --> 03:54:55.399 align:start position:0%
uh was created I don't know if you're
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with that does anybody does
 
03:54:58.269 --> 03:54:58.279 align:start position:0%
that ring a bell with anyway but the
 
03:54:59.550 --> 03:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
fact that it's the market can be a
 
03:55:02.870 --> 03:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
roller coaster uh there's a cartoon meme
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
that was created by a guy in New
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and now he's selling
 
03:55:11.550 --> 03:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
non-fungible token of his meme like uh
 
03:55:12.990 --> 03:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
and he and he's doing it on the Bitcoin
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
blockchain with something called
 
03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
counterparty so that's a New Hampshire
 
03:55:22.030 --> 03:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
me me you say me I thought it was a me
 
03:55:29.149 --> 03:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:33.030 --> 03:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
okay yeah uh quick question I'm not sure
 
03:55:34.830 --> 03:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
if it's appropriate but the amount of
 
03:55:39.670 --> 03:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
energy that it takes to um you know um
 
03:55:42.389 --> 03:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
make these transactions um I I'm hearing
 
03:55:45.229 --> 03:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
it's astronomical I mean it it really is
 
03:55:47.389 --> 03:55:47.399 align:start position:0%
not too energy
 
03:55:49.790 --> 03:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
efficient is that that's a question like
 
03:55:51.750 --> 03:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
could you sort of address the energy
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
portion of this I that's sort of a
 
03:55:55.950 --> 03:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
separate discussion but I will address
 
03:55:59.070 --> 03:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
it um it depends on the consensus
 
03:56:02.590 --> 03:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism of that blockchain so
 
03:56:02.600 --> 03:56:04.149 align:start position:0%
mechanism of that blockchain so
consensus

03:56:04.149 --> 03:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
03:56:06.590 --> 03:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
is here's a real easy example let's say
 
03:56:08.429 --> 03:56:08.439 align:start position:0%
you have an Excel spreadsheet or a word
 
03:56:08.439 --> 03:56:09.670 align:start position:0%
you have an Excel spreadsheet or a word
doc

03:56:09.670 --> 03:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
doc
 
03:56:12.429 --> 03:56:12.439 align:start position:0%
and there's changes being made to it but
 
03:56:14.910 --> 03:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
you want everyone in the world to agree
 
03:56:17.510 --> 03:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
on those changes that's consensus right
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's a an algorithm to allow
 
03:56:24.389 --> 03:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
everyone to agree on the same version of
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
something that's changing and there's
 
03:56:28.229 --> 03:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
something called proof of work algorithm
 
03:56:30.550 --> 03:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
that was that's called Satoshi consensus
 
03:56:33.590 --> 03:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's the first algorithm and that does
 
03:56:35.950 --> 03:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
require energy it requires energy
 
03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
because it requires computation so
 
03:56:40.790 --> 03:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
computer requires energy it requires
 
03:56:43.910 --> 03:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
electrons to to compute and so the the
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
computation is what creates the
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
consensus so that's where the energy
 
03:56:50.349 --> 03:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
consumption comes from but there are
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
other uh blockchains something called
 
03:56:55.950 --> 03:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
proof of stake which is requires much
 
03:56:57.910 --> 03:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
less energy there's something called
 
03:56:59.550 --> 03:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
Avalanche consensus there's other
 
03:57:01.309 --> 03:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
algorithms being developed to provide
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
that consensus that don't require energy
 
03:57:06.309 --> 03:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
um there there are arguments that
 
03:57:10.110 --> 03:57:10.120 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin is incentivizing green energy uh
 
03:57:13.030 --> 03:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
believe it or not um I mentioned the the
 
03:57:15.510 --> 03:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
example in Argent in El Salvador they're
 
03:57:18.389 --> 03:57:18.399 align:start position:0%
using geothermal from a volcano uh
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
there's a project in Pennsylvania so you
 
03:57:23.790 --> 03:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
have a nuclear power plant the power
 
03:57:25.469 --> 03:57:25.479 align:start position:0%
plant it's not easy to switch it on and
 
03:57:29.070 --> 03:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
off right um and for renewable energy
 
03:57:31.189 --> 03:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
you need base load power because the
 
03:57:32.790 --> 03:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
sun's not always shining and the wind's
 
03:57:34.229 --> 03:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
not always blowing right so and you
 
03:57:36.389 --> 03:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
can't really store electricity on a grid
 
03:57:38.590 --> 03:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
scale so you need base load power and
 
03:57:40.710 --> 03:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
that can be provided by natural gas or
 
03:57:44.269 --> 03:57:44.279 align:start position:0%
or uh Nuclear So in Pennsylvania there's
 
03:57:46.670 --> 03:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
a project they have a nuclear power
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
plant it's profitable that the energy is
 
03:57:51.670 --> 03:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
profitable sometimes and it's not
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
profitable other times to go on the grid
 
03:57:56.030 --> 03:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
so they're building a Bitcoin mining
 
03:57:58.389 --> 03:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
facility next to the nuclear power plant
 
03:58:00.309 --> 03:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
so when the energy is not profitable to
 
03:58:02.830 --> 03:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
go onto the grid they turn on the Mining
 
03:58:05.389 --> 03:58:05.399 align:start position:0%
facility and they cre they create
 
03:58:08.630 --> 03:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
potential economic energy if you think
 
03:58:11.830 --> 03:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
about it um so that's a that's a big
 
03:58:13.309 --> 03:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
that's the size of a nuclear power plant
 
03:58:16.710 --> 03:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
that project so um now there's that's a
 
03:58:18.229 --> 03:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
whole another long conversation happy to
 
03:58:21.070 --> 03:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
have um but the there there's arguments
 
03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
that it's incentivizing green energy or
 
03:58:25.830 --> 03:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know carbon neutral energy it does
 
03:58:27.750 --> 03:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
all you could use coal any any kind of
 
03:58:30.030 --> 03:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
energy you could use to to mine for the
 
03:58:33.189 --> 03:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
proof of work algorithm but so
 
03:58:36.670 --> 03:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
interesting question okay great thank
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you all right uh
 
03:58:41.030 --> 03:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
chair we'll call on Lisa
 
03:58:44.149 --> 03:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
tap who's representing herself in
 
03:58:55.750 --> 03:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:59.110 --> 03:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
bill good afternoon good afternoon thank
 
03:59:01.110 --> 03:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair Mr Vice chair and members
 
03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee I am signing in and
 
03:59:05.590 --> 03:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
testifying in favor of all three bills
 
03:59:07.110 --> 03:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
but with the chair's permission I will
 
03:59:10.149 --> 03:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
speak just once un otherwise sure we
 
03:59:12.469 --> 03:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
love that I am both an attorney and a
 
03:59:14.469 --> 03:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner here in New Hampshire
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
I will briefly describe what brought
 
03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
digital currency to my attention and why
 
03:59:20.950 --> 03:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
I thought it was better to get it more
 
03:59:23.110 --> 03:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
widespread in society and then I'll
 
03:59:25.110 --> 03:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
explain about why I think this is a good
 
03:59:26.590 --> 03:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
time for it to happen here in New
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I first um learned about
 
03:59:34.110 --> 03:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
the background of of digital currencies
 
03:59:36.189 --> 03:59:36.199 align:start position:0%
via a white paper that was written that
 
03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
um described a database that was
 
03:59:42.189 --> 03:59:42.199 align:start position:0%
immutable and allowed for immediate
 
03:59:44.670 --> 03:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
action and I thought that was terrific
 
03:59:46.830 --> 03:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
because as a nurse practitioner and an
 
03:59:49.870 --> 03:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
attorney in both situations I find that
 
03:59:52.910 --> 03:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
when people can't immediately appreciate
 
03:59:54.710 --> 03:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
what they're doing in terms of spending
 
03:59:56.830 --> 03:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
money or any other action that leads us
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
to problems down the road so I really
 
04:00:01.309 --> 04:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
liked that immediacy and I like that
 
04:00:04.030 --> 04:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
it's open um um speaking to
 
04:00:06.870 --> 04:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert's concerns about
 
04:00:09.149 --> 04:00:09.159 align:start position:0%
illegal activity I regular attend the
 
04:00:10.990 --> 04:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
American Bar Association digital
 
04:00:13.950 --> 04:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
currency conferences and they're lovely
 
04:00:16.510 --> 04:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
they uh several attorneys in the field
 
04:00:18.389 --> 04:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
as well as Federal prosecutors from
 
04:00:20.349 --> 04:00:20.359 align:start position:0%
several branches of government and this
 
04:00:22.630 --> 04:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
is a concern of mine as was a concern of
 
04:00:24.550 --> 04:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
theirs and over and over again what I
 
04:00:27.030 --> 04:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
hear at those seminars is nothing will
 
04:00:29.550 --> 04:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
ever top the American dollar as as a
 
04:00:32.070 --> 04:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
valuable resource for terrorism
 
04:00:35.830 --> 04:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately but when people who engage
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
in terroristic or predatory activities
 
04:00:41.149 --> 04:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
use an open blockchain it's a real Boon
 
04:00:42.550 --> 04:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
to the federal government because it's
 
04:00:45.550 --> 04:00:45.560 align:start position:0%
all trackable so there was a lot of
 
04:00:47.750 --> 04:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
interest actually and not shutting down
 
04:00:49.309 --> 04:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
that kind of activity because it makes
 
04:00:51.469 --> 04:00:51.479 align:start position:0%
investigation so much easier and I share
 
04:00:53.670 --> 04:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
that concern and several Federal
 
04:00:55.590 --> 04:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
prosecutors have allayed those concerns
 
04:00:57.950 --> 04:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
for me at these conferences that I
 
04:01:00.149 --> 04:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
attend but I want to go to the most
 
04:01:02.349 --> 04:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
poignant example of why I thought it
 
04:01:05.309 --> 04:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
would be good to get digital currencies
 
04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
more active in our system and that's
 
04:01:09.429 --> 04:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
because as a nurse Pro ition here at the
 
04:01:12.510 --> 04:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
state prison up the road I started a
 
04:01:15.790 --> 04:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
clinic for um for halfway house members
 
04:01:17.750 --> 04:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
who were about to transition back into
 
04:01:19.590 --> 04:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
the community and they need to establish
 
04:01:21.149 --> 04:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
their own health
 
04:01:24.349 --> 04:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
care and when it came to sitting down
 
04:01:26.389 --> 04:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
and we literally practice conversations
 
04:01:28.429 --> 04:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
and many of the the men that I worked
 
04:01:29.670 --> 04:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
with at that time were not good at
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
describing what they need so we practice
 
04:01:32.910 --> 04:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
how you're going to sit down and how
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to talk to your physician
 
04:01:35.950 --> 04:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
about what you need what your health
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
care concerns are it always went back to
 
04:01:41.309 --> 04:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
money and I didn't understand that and
 
04:01:44.030 --> 04:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
then I realized that inability to handle
 
04:01:46.590 --> 04:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
money had gotten a lot of the men I was
 
04:01:48.070 --> 04:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
working with into the situation they
 
04:01:50.030 --> 04:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
were with however if you learn to handle
 
04:01:52.870 --> 04:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
money via digital currencies you learn
 
04:01:54.630 --> 04:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
that it's immediate you're not dealing
 
04:01:56.309 --> 04:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
with credit you're not dealing with
 
04:01:59.710 --> 04:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
speculation you pay what you have and if
 
04:02:01.149 --> 04:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
you don't have it you simply can't pay
 
04:02:02.550 --> 04:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
it and you can't get into as much
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
trouble so that aspect appealed to me
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to see that become more
 
04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
widespread in
 
04:02:10.830 --> 04:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
society so uh I went back to school I I
 
04:02:13.149 --> 04:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
attended University of New Hampshire law
 
04:02:15.510 --> 04:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
school originally in the 1990s and I
 
04:02:17.670 --> 04:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
went back recently and became certified
 
04:02:20.229 --> 04:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
in digital currencies um and I believe
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with representative Bartlett
 
04:02:24.429 --> 04:02:24.439 align:start position:0%
actually at a digital currency seminar a
 
04:02:26.950 --> 04:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
couple years ago it's been a wonderful
 
04:02:28.550 --> 04:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
experience here in New Hampshire I think
 
04:02:30.510 --> 04:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing it very responsibly and the
 
04:02:32.590 --> 04:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
reason that I think it's great to tie in
 
04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
the banking industry now is because I
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
want to see this more widespread I want
 
04:02:39.389 --> 04:02:39.399 align:start position:0%
to see the men that come out of the
 
04:02:42.870 --> 04:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
prison learn how to interact immediately
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
like this will be the consequence of the
 
04:02:47.110 --> 04:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
debt that I take on this will be the
 
04:02:48.630 --> 04:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
consequence of giving up the money for
 
04:02:51.429 --> 04:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
what I want and when I provide a service
 
04:02:53.469 --> 04:02:53.479 align:start position:0%
I can be paid immediately I don't need
 
04:02:56.110 --> 04:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
to wait for it to clear through a bank
 
04:02:59.030 --> 04:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
however banks have good experience in
 
04:03:01.149 --> 04:03:01.159 align:start position:0%
helping people manage those things and I
 
04:03:04.070 --> 04:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
think if we can bring digital currencies
 
04:03:06.269 --> 04:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
and banking together as has Wyoming and
 
04:03:07.710 --> 04:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
some other states that representative
 
04:03:07.720 --> 04:03:09.349 align:start position:0%
some other states that representative
Ammon

04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
Ammon
 
04:03:11.389 --> 04:03:11.399 align:start position:0%
referenced I think we could really be a
 
04:03:13.670 --> 04:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
leader than that I think it teaches
 
04:03:16.990 --> 04:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
transparency honesty um and it's
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
immediate a third point I'll make is
 
04:03:21.149 --> 04:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
it's contactless and the reason I bring
 
04:03:22.950 --> 04:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
that up is because I have family who
 
04:03:24.429 --> 04:03:24.439 align:start position:0%
live in New York and they're currently
 
04:03:27.189 --> 04:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
on isolation due to having
 
04:03:30.870 --> 04:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and they they had a bill coming
 
04:03:33.070 --> 04:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
du it's a very standard Bill not a big
 
04:03:35.550 --> 04:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
deal but they typically go to the bank
 
04:03:37.790 --> 04:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
or transfer some monies online ahead
 
04:03:41.590 --> 04:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
ofay paying it well the way things fell
 
04:03:43.990 --> 04:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
one person's paycheck is not coming into
 
04:03:45.870 --> 04:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
the same place that it used to they so
 
04:03:48.229 --> 04:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
they didn't have the ability to transfer
 
04:03:50.189 --> 04:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
within one Bank online they couldn't get
 
04:03:52.189 --> 04:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
the funds to where it needed to be
 
04:03:54.990 --> 04:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
before the bill was due so what we did
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
was I was able to send them digital
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
currency through coinbase they set their
 
04:04:02.510 --> 04:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
coinbase up to interact with the bank
 
04:04:04.950 --> 04:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
that needed to have this bill paid I
 
04:04:06.550 --> 04:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
sent it to them within two hours they
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
were able to pay the bill the only other
 
04:04:11.309 --> 04:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
option I would have had would be to wire
 
04:04:13.550 --> 04:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
I mean my family's home on quarantine
 
04:04:16.030 --> 04:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
they can't go to a bank and none of us
 
04:04:18.670 --> 04:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
had this kind of time and I realized
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
this contactless currency this offers a
 
04:04:25.149 --> 04:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
lot more than I realized immediate
 
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
contactless currency is something that
 
04:04:28.790 --> 04:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go forward with in New
 
04:04:30.630 --> 04:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here to help I know there
 
04:04:34.510 --> 04:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
are several crypto Geeks like me who are
 
04:04:36.149 --> 04:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
here to help as well representative
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
anaman has led the way with with establ
 
04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
establishing a presence here so I think
 
04:04:44.229 --> 04:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
this is a great time to move forward
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
with this I'd like to see this more
 
04:04:48.990 --> 04:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
widespread I think it's a Back to Basics
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
although the technology is new the
 
04:04:53.389 --> 04:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
actual spending patterns are Back to
 
04:04:55.389 --> 04:04:55.399 align:start position:0%
Basics this is how you spent money in
 
04:04:57.710 --> 04:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
the early 20th century you bought what
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
you had in the bank and could afford you
 
04:05:02.670 --> 04:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
didn't speculate as much you immediately
 
04:05:04.670 --> 04:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
saw the consequences of work that you
 
04:05:07.990 --> 04:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
did and obligations that you took on so
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
so another reason that I think it's a
 
04:05:12.149 --> 04:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
good time to move forward with this is
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
coming out of these American Bar
 
04:05:16.590 --> 04:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
Association I'm sorry Association
 
04:05:18.990 --> 04:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
seminars that I attend I realize how
 
04:05:20.590 --> 04:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed the federal government is
 
04:05:23.630 --> 04:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
right now I work with prosecutors from
 
04:05:25.349 --> 04:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
several different divisions of
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
government and everyone's got too much
 
04:05:31.229 --> 04:05:31.239 align:start position:0%
on their plate but we have it going on
 
04:05:33.710 --> 04:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
here you to use a colloquial term we can
 
04:05:35.670 --> 04:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
do it we can go forward and when they're
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
able to get to this when the other
 
04:05:38.590 --> 04:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
things have cleared off their plate
 
04:05:41.349 --> 04:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
we're there to help um I would analogize
 
04:05:44.149 --> 04:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
this to 1998 I hosted the barn civil uh
 
04:05:46.149 --> 04:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
bound Civil Right Forum here in Conquer
 
04:05:48.910 --> 04:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it was related to laws and
 
04:05:50.590 --> 04:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
regulations of use of the internet and
 
04:05:52.670 --> 04:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
we hosted some people who had argued
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
seminal case in the second circuit in
 
04:05:56.990 --> 04:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia and in the years to come
 
04:05:59.070 --> 04:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
after that we were regularly consulted
 
04:06:01.030 --> 04:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
for Think Tank ideas that came out of
 
04:06:03.149 --> 04:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
the conference that we held I think if
 
04:06:05.070 --> 04:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
we do it here and do it well we're there
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
to help and make it easier for the
 
04:06:08.950 --> 04:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
federal government later if they wish to
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
look toward this
 
04:06:13.790 --> 04:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
issue and that's about the gist of my
 
04:06:15.269 --> 04:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
comments I'd be happy to take questions
 
04:06:20.070 --> 04:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:23.229 --> 04:06:23.239 align:start position:0%
approves thank you m thank you Mr chair
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again nice to see you
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you could I back you up just a
 
04:06:29.670 --> 04:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
little bit Mr um I I just want to go
 
04:06:32.070 --> 04:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
through the chain of how you did this
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
yes um you were helping a family member
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
yes um you needed to be able to get
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
digital currency so so they could pay a
 
04:06:41.670 --> 04:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
bills so you you went to your
 
04:06:44.910 --> 04:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
account and you sent money to their
 
04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
account is that correct correct now is
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
there a bank involved in that yes so
 
04:06:51.750 --> 04:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
when you're using a digital currency
 
04:06:55.590 --> 04:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
exchange it cashes out into a bank okay
 
04:06:57.710 --> 04:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
this was more about logistics they had
 
04:06:59.790 --> 04:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
the funds but they were in a bank not
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
attached to the bill that they needed to
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
pay typically a direct deposit check
 
04:07:06.149 --> 04:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
comes into that bank but my family
 
04:07:09.149 --> 04:07:09.159 align:start position:0%
member can't work because he has Co so
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
we needed to get to the funds into that
 
04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
bank and so he was just able to go right
 
04:07:16.229 --> 04:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
on coinbase open up an account that
 
04:07:19.269 --> 04:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
dumped into that um that bank account
 
04:07:21.070 --> 04:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
and then I just transferred and it was
 
04:07:22.990 --> 04:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
faster than trying to go to a bank and
 
04:07:25.070 --> 04:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
and it was possible because you can't go
 
04:07:27.030 --> 04:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
to a bank when you're quarantining right
 
04:07:29.109 --> 04:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
okay so the money went right into the
 
04:07:32.149 --> 04:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
your digital currency went right into
 
04:07:34.030 --> 04:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
the account that he opened up yes then
 
04:07:35.469 --> 04:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
he took that money and it went right
 
04:07:37.910 --> 04:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
into the bank and then by EFT paid the
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
bill yeah and I was like why did I not
 
04:07:42.750 --> 04:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
realize how valuable contactless
 
04:07:44.550 --> 04:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
currency is in our society let's talk
 
04:07:46.830 --> 04:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
about that more another great reason why
 
04:07:51.229 --> 04:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:55.469 --> 04:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
you I muted thank you very much for your
 
04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
you uh the chair will call on Amilia
 
04:08:03.469 --> 04:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
galdi who from the banking department
 
04:08:05.510 --> 04:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
and the banking Department takes no
 
04:08:08.710 --> 04:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
position on the bill
 
04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd like to begin and
 
04:08:13.269 --> 04:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
congratulate you on your new position
 
04:08:13.279 --> 04:08:15.070 align:start position:0%
congratulate you on your new position
thank

04:08:15.070 --> 04:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:08:15.080 --> 04:08:16.670 align:start position:0%
thank
you

04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:08:20.189 --> 04:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
sorry um good afternoon my name is
 
04:08:22.510 --> 04:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
Amelia Galder I'm the Deputy
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioner for the State of New
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I represent the state of
 
04:08:27.149 --> 04:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire banking Department thank
 
04:08:30.149 --> 04:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
you for hearing my testimony um with
 
04:08:32.710 --> 04:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
regard to hb52 the banking Department
 
04:08:34.750 --> 04:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a position on the
 
04:08:37.830 --> 04:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
underlying policy of this bill um
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
however if this is a direction that the
 
04:08:42.910 --> 04:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
um legislature would like to go um we do
 
04:08:47.109 --> 04:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
have some concerns about the um this
 
04:08:48.830 --> 04:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
bill itself and how it would need to be
 
04:08:51.309 --> 04:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
changed to make it more workable for the
 
04:08:56.189 --> 04:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
Department um for first it seems to be
 
04:08:57.510 --> 04:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
contemplated to be under our
 
04:09:02.910 --> 04:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in RSA 397 C I think um and
 
04:09:05.229 --> 04:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
if it is trying to amend the UCC it
 
04:09:09.030 --> 04:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
probably belongs with the other UC
 
04:09:13.229 --> 04:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
Provisions I think um and just some
 
04:09:15.990 --> 04:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
caution about amending the UCC I know
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
some other folks have talked about it
 
04:09:18.750 --> 04:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
and I think you're going to hear from
 
04:09:20.030 --> 04:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
some other folks who are going to talk
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
more about it um but um I think one of
 
04:09:25.389 --> 04:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
the goals of the UCC is to facilitate
 
04:09:28.309 --> 04:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce and that's why you
 
04:09:30.269 --> 04:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
want to be very careful about amending
 
04:09:32.349 --> 04:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
it because you want your uccc to match
 
04:09:34.670 --> 04:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
other states ucc's so that way when
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
you're exchanging negotiable instruments
 
04:09:38.830 --> 04:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
between states and you know if one of
 
04:09:41.189 --> 04:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
the goals of crypto
 
04:09:44.750 --> 04:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
currency uh culture or transmission or
 
04:09:47.950 --> 04:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
what Blain Blain blockchain and whatever
 
04:09:49.550 --> 04:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh piece of it you want to be involved
 
04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
in you most likely want to be able to
 
04:09:55.030 --> 04:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
get it to another state um so generally
 
04:09:57.189 --> 04:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
speaking I think that's a reason to be
 
04:09:59.189 --> 04:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
very cautious about amending the uccc
 
04:10:00.750 --> 04:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
and I think more people are going to
 
04:10:04.349 --> 04:10:04.359 align:start position:0%
talk about that probably today um so a
 
04:10:06.149 --> 04:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
couple of the highlevel issues that
 
04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
would need to be resolved in this
 
04:10:10.630 --> 04:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
putting that issue aside um it talks a
 
04:10:14.670 --> 04:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
lot about Banks um and bank is a very
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
defined term and our statutes are
 
04:10:18.790 --> 04:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
defined a bunch of different ways um
 
04:10:20.750 --> 04:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
there are many different types of banks
 
04:10:23.070 --> 04:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
there's um state if you talk about State
 
04:10:25.710 --> 04:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
Banks that includes trust companies
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
non-depository trust companies uh
 
04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
traditional Banks um and so forth um and
 
04:10:34.429 --> 04:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
it's not defined in this bill um so you
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
would want to be very careful about who
 
04:10:38.309 --> 04:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I hear a lot of
 
04:10:40.269 --> 04:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
talk at least in the last testimony
 
04:10:42.269 --> 04:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
about what we consider at the banking
 
04:10:44.790 --> 04:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
Department money transmission that falls
 
04:10:50.149 --> 04:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
under RSA 399 G it's a ly type um where
 
04:10:51.630 --> 04:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
this says bank I don't think it
 
04:10:54.269 --> 04:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
contemplates that but interestingly
 
04:10:57.109 --> 04:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
397 is part it falls within what's
 
04:10:58.590 --> 04:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
traditionally considered our Consumer
 
04:11:01.950 --> 04:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
Credit division um jurisdiction which
 
04:11:05.229 --> 04:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
includes money transmitters um so just
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
kind of some confusing things that would
 
04:11:09.510 --> 04:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
need to be worked out before anything
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
could move forward on this um there's
 
04:11:15.389 --> 04:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
one other big or maybe two other big
 
04:11:17.790 --> 04:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
issues that are that I see just looking
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
at this on a high level not going line
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
by line is there seems to be a separate
 
04:11:24.910 --> 04:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
fee contemplated going to the um Bank
 
04:11:27.469 --> 04:11:27.479 align:start position:0%
banking Department um that the way that
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
fee is designed it's not consistent with
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
our current funding model so that would
 
04:11:35.070 --> 04:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
need to be amended to be consistent um
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
addition where is that fee oh gosh I
 
04:11:39.109 --> 04:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
knew you're going to ask me that let's
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
see here let's see if I can find it I I
 
04:11:44.510 --> 04:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
saw was uh it's towards the end0 one10
 
04:11:47.149 --> 04:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
of1 million related to assets held in
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
custody yes and I apologize I could not
 
04:11:52.750 --> 04:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
print the version with the line numbers
 
04:11:54.990 --> 04:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
right um but that is it yep that's a
 
04:11:57.070 --> 04:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
little different than anything than any
 
04:11:58.389 --> 04:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
way we're funded at the banking
 
04:12:00.550 --> 04:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
Department currently um so you might
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
want to consider making that
 
04:12:08.670 --> 04:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
consistent um and where this seems to be
 
04:12:11.630 --> 04:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
having its own chapter and referring to
 
04:12:15.429 --> 04:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
broadly a bank once you figure out what
 
04:12:18.590 --> 04:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
you mean by Bank you may want to build
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
in some sort if we're if we're going to
 
04:12:23.550 --> 04:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
be you know having jurisdiction over
 
04:12:26.510 --> 04:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
these type of transactions or you know I
 
04:12:28.269 --> 04:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not really sure exactly what's
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
going on here but if if if you want us
 
04:12:31.750 --> 04:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
to have jurisdiction you probably want
 
04:12:33.429 --> 04:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
to have a complaint process for consumer
 
04:12:35.429 --> 04:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
complaints and that doesn't seem to be
 
04:12:37.229 --> 04:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
developed in here at all um
 
04:12:39.189 --> 04:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
traditionally when we regulate an entity
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
type we want you know consumers come to
 
04:12:43.189 --> 04:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
us all the time and that's an important
 
04:12:44.830 --> 04:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
part of what the banking department does
 
04:12:46.830 --> 04:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
so we would want to make sure that any
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
consumer who came to us would be taken
 
04:12:52.109 --> 04:12:52.119 align:start position:0%
care of so I think looking just at this
 
04:12:53.590 --> 04:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
bill I know it's part of the trio of
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
bills that you're talking about today
 
04:12:56.670 --> 04:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to confuse things by
 
04:13:02.550 --> 04:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
going into the 1504 um now but at a high
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
level that would be the banking
 
04:13:05.830 --> 04:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
Department's concerns about this
 
04:13:08.590 --> 04:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
one and I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:13:11.469 --> 04:13:11.479 align:start position:0%
so when you came up with director and
 
04:13:14.910 --> 04:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
examiner and this whole fiscal note is
 
04:13:17.229 --> 04:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
that what Wyoming has that they really
 
04:13:19.750 --> 04:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
spend all this kind of money yeah so so
 
04:13:22.269 --> 04:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
that we did sort of one fiscal note for
 
04:13:25.550 --> 04:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
1502 and 154 yeah the same um so we
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
actually went to Wyoming and this is the
 
04:13:30.630 --> 04:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
Baseline of what Wyoming recommended to
 
04:13:32.030 --> 04:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
us he actually the commissioner of
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
Wyoming Albert forkner we spoke with him
 
04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
he actually recommended asking for more
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
because they're finding they need more
 
04:13:40.590 --> 04:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
than this than what we put in our fiscal
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
note because it's really a truly in
 
04:13:46.269 --> 04:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
terms of 1504 now um it's really truly
 
04:13:49.229 --> 04:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
its own regime it's its own division at
 
04:13:50.590 --> 04:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
the Wyoming banking Department it
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
requires a division director attorneys
 
04:13:54.269 --> 04:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
who specialize in
 
04:13:56.670 --> 04:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency exam they had to develop
 
04:14:00.149 --> 04:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
a whole examination procedural manual
 
04:14:01.469 --> 04:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
because we've never examined anything
 
04:14:02.750 --> 04:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
like that they hired an outside
 
04:14:04.109 --> 04:14:04.119 align:start position:0%
consultant to develop theirs because
 
04:14:05.389 --> 04:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
that was really the only way they could
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
do it in a safe and sound manner and a
 
04:14:10.750 --> 04:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
responsible regulatory manner um they
 
04:14:13.149 --> 04:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
said they would lend us their manual
 
04:14:15.070 --> 04:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
that they developed but we'd have to pay
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
for it um because they spent a lot of
 
04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
money on it Li license us for that yeah
 
04:14:20.710 --> 04:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
they said they would license it to us I
 
04:14:22.830 --> 04:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
think um but we didn't really go down
 
04:14:25.229 --> 04:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
that road with them too much um so he
 
04:14:26.670 --> 04:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
actually recommended asking for more
 
04:14:29.429 --> 04:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
than what we recommended so or what we
 
04:14:31.550 --> 04:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
ended up asking for so The $64,000
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
Question are they bringing in enough
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
money to pay for their banking
 
04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
Department I believe so I I would have
 
04:14:40.389 --> 04:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
to look into that a little bit more I um
 
04:14:41.550 --> 04:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
things are a little bit busy at the
 
04:14:42.990 --> 04:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
banking Department right now so I can't
 
04:14:46.670 --> 04:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
quite bring that piece of it to mind um
 
04:14:48.990 --> 04:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
but I know they I believe the last time
 
04:14:50.870 --> 04:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
I spoke with them they have four of
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
these special depository entities right
 
04:14:56.109 --> 04:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
I think um that's
 
04:14:58.510 --> 04:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
14504 is it four still have you spoken
 
04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
with that's he said that's 1504 the
 
04:15:02.429 --> 04:15:02.439 align:start position:0%
other Bill oh I think your number's
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah I mean at the end of the
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
day is because the way we our banking
 
04:15:11.030 --> 04:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
Department we have fees right and we
 
04:15:12.910 --> 04:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
have fees for when we come to do our
 
04:15:14.790 --> 04:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
investigation right but at the end of
 
04:15:17.910 --> 04:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
the day uh if it doesn't meet what the
 
04:15:20.189 --> 04:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
cost of the department is we have an
 
04:15:23.070 --> 04:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
assessment system to go back and and
 
04:15:26.910 --> 04:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
collect some more money so that the
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
question I guess you know are they are
 
04:15:30.590 --> 04:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
they breaking even are they you know
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
they breaking even over there because we
 
04:15:34.109 --> 04:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't want to get into it
 
04:15:36.389 --> 04:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
and have this huge bill for the state
 
04:15:38.510 --> 04:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
and not get the revenue yeah I think
 
04:15:40.710 --> 04:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
that would be a question so jumping to
 
04:15:43.870 --> 04:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
1504 I wasn't you know um I have a whole
 
04:15:47.469 --> 04:15:47.479 align:start position:0%
Spiel I can do about that too um but um
 
04:15:50.630 --> 04:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
there the way Wyoming is funded is very
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
different than the way we were funded at
 
04:15:53.670 --> 04:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
the banking Department I believe and I
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
believe that this what's contemplated in
 
04:15:57.510 --> 04:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
here is different than our funding model
 
04:15:58.910 --> 04:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
well they're they're not self-funded
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
they're probably General General funded
 
04:16:04.189 --> 04:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
oh gosh I don't want to say because
 
04:16:06.389 --> 04:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
I the finance part we're going to have
 
04:16:10.109 --> 04:16:10.119 align:start position:0%
to just it's just different y okay
 
04:16:12.670 --> 04:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
y representative
 
04:16:15.030 --> 04:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
Herbert thank
 
04:16:18.070 --> 04:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
you this question by the
 
04:16:21.670 --> 04:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
way my question actually uh comes to me
 
04:16:24.389 --> 04:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
because of the discussion and it's
 
04:16:27.109 --> 04:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
a it's a very basic question and maybe
 
04:16:29.229 --> 04:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
there's somebody here that can answer it
 
04:16:31.870 --> 04:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
for me better than than you can I I
 
04:16:34.750 --> 04:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not worried about the fees
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
because Bitcoin is just stick question
 
04:16:41.870 --> 04:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
Financial money but uh um my question is
 
04:16:44.870 --> 04:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
when somebody writes a
 
04:16:47.590 --> 04:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
check uh in
 
04:16:50.950 --> 04:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin and it goes to a bank and it
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
goes to a vendor maybe or the recipient
 
04:16:55.469 --> 04:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
and it gets turned into
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
Dollars I'm I'm unclear as to exactly
 
04:17:01.750 --> 04:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
how that's going on I mean right now as
 
04:17:04.750 --> 04:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
we sit here today it sounds to me as
 
04:17:07.030 --> 04:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
though it's not an issue in other words
 
04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
you can you can order something in
 
04:17:11.590 --> 04:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin and it'll go to wherever your
 
04:17:13.630 --> 04:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
bank is and the bank will
 
04:17:17.229 --> 04:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
automatically uh turn it into
 
04:17:20.070 --> 04:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
dollars and so therefore therefore the
 
04:17:25.149 --> 04:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh the I I if I'm getting it right uh um
 
04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's I find it very upsetting that we're
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
actually doing this but uh this means
 
04:17:33.790 --> 04:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
that um there is no issue uh in terms of
 
04:17:37.469 --> 04:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
doing business whatever your business is
 
04:17:39.229 --> 04:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh and wherever your business is it
 
04:17:41.790 --> 04:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
could be you know Puerto Rico or uh
 
04:17:43.269 --> 04:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
China for that matter well you can't do
 
04:17:44.990 --> 04:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
it out of China because they they put
 
04:17:47.109 --> 04:17:47.119 align:start position:0%
the kabash on bitcoin they decided they
 
04:17:50.830 --> 04:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
weren't going to play but then it's all
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's all very uh fluid in and in as
 
04:17:58.469 --> 04:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
practical matter we are already
 
04:18:02.670 --> 04:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
using uh Bitcoin as our
 
04:18:05.229 --> 04:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
currency okay that's your question that
 
04:18:07.469 --> 04:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
is my question and I'm still not clear
 
04:18:10.670 --> 04:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
about the mechanics of it but uh you
 
04:18:12.269 --> 04:18:12.279 align:start position:0%
know I thought it was not
 
04:18:15.790 --> 04:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
legal and so obviously at some point it
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
became very legal for you to say here's
 
04:18:20.149 --> 04:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
my Bitcoin account and you can there's
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
my dollar account and they can be uh we
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
will gladly make the
 
04:18:30.389 --> 04:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
transition uh so if that's the
 
04:18:33.309 --> 04:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
case have we already adopted a second
 
04:18:36.309 --> 04:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
currency no and she will answer your
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
question okay okay so I think the the
 
04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
easiest way for me to answer your
 
04:18:43.630 --> 04:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
question is to say that there are
 
04:18:45.630 --> 04:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
current we currently licensed money
 
04:18:48.950 --> 04:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
transmitters who um will take this is
 
04:18:51.269 --> 04:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
very oversimplified I apologize to all
 
04:18:53.670 --> 04:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
the Bitcoin enthusiasts who I may be
 
04:18:56.109 --> 04:18:56.119 align:start position:0%
oversimplifying this for um so we
 
04:18:57.870 --> 04:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
currently license money transmitters who
 
04:19:01.030 --> 04:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
will take your Bitcoin and give somebody
 
04:19:04.990 --> 04:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
else money like dollar fiat currency so
 
04:19:07.070 --> 04:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
there's a third party involved here we
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
only regul so we only regulate it when
 
04:19:11.550 --> 04:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
there is a third party for in terms of
 
04:19:13.950 --> 04:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
money transmitters if you wanted to give
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
your Bitcoin to um chairman hunt you
 
04:19:19.229 --> 04:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
could do that with no like I wouldn't
 
04:19:20.750 --> 04:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
need nobody would know nobody would need
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
to be involved um it's a completely
 
04:19:25.189 --> 04:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
separate thing much like if you gave him
 
04:19:27.510 --> 04:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
cash nobody would need to be involved in
 
04:19:31.590 --> 04:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
that um so we currently regulate
 
04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
entities that take Bitcoin give give out
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
currency PE out currency we do not
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
regulate companies that take Bitcoin and
 
04:19:43.109 --> 04:19:43.119 align:start position:0%
only give Bitcoin that was specifically
 
04:19:45.670 --> 04:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
Exempted in
 
04:19:49.349 --> 04:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
2017 you may remember um we went how
 
04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
could I forget yep we went through uh
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
that and developed a specific exemption
 
04:19:56.189 --> 04:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
from our money transmitter laws for
 
04:20:00.030 --> 04:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
folks who do money transmission of like
 
04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
the third party with just the crypto on
 
04:20:04.710 --> 04:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
either side okay one more just question
 
04:20:07.030 --> 04:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
and you're going to be specific now the
 
04:20:09.910 --> 04:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
the third party uh in the first
 
04:20:12.550 --> 04:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
transaction is not a
 
04:20:16.790 --> 04:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
bank it's somebody who has access to
 
04:20:20.070 --> 04:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
bitcoin and has agreed
 
04:20:23.870 --> 04:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
to uh send out those dollars it has
 
04:20:26.429 --> 04:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
access to but that's not a bank if
 
04:20:30.149 --> 04:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
somebody's got a a business uh correct
 
04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
all right I'm I'm not sure I I've never
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
heard of these organizations we did the
 
04:20:34.990 --> 04:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
money transfer business so everybody
 
04:20:37.309 --> 04:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
used to think of Western Union yep okay
 
04:20:40.389 --> 04:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
or coinbase but and coinbase um and
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're in the business they're
 
04:20:43.630 --> 04:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
they're in there they're doing it are
 
04:20:46.349 --> 04:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
they US based but I I found that the
 
04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
that the easiest way to transfer money
 
04:20:50.670 --> 04:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
to somebody is to go down to my local
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
Walmart and transfer it to the Walmart
 
04:20:55.830 --> 04:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
that they're near to them but that's
 
04:20:57.510 --> 04:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
cash only that's not Bitcoin I don't
 
04:20:59.149 --> 04:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
believe Walmart is doing Bitcoin I think
 
04:21:01.070 --> 04:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
Walmart would be is licensed by us
 
04:21:02.469 --> 04:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
though and that's
 
04:21:05.149 --> 04:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
they again the license is just a
 
04:21:07.429 --> 04:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
registration and so that if there was a
 
04:21:09.389 --> 04:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
Consumer complaint we would know who to
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
follow and we examine them so these
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
third parties already exist who
 
04:21:16.269 --> 04:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
regulates them we do yep we regulate
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
they're not a bank correct we regulate
 
04:21:21.070 --> 04:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
um Consumer Credit Division Licenses in
 
04:21:23.109 --> 04:21:23.119 align:start position:0%
addition to banks credit unions trust
 
04:21:25.389 --> 04:21:25.399 align:start position:0%
companies then in consumer credit
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
division we regulate money transmitters
 
04:21:30.109 --> 04:21:30.119 align:start position:0%
small loan lenders Mortgage Bankers and
 
04:21:34.349 --> 04:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
Brokers uh I'm missing one sorry yes um
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
but money transmitters would be the type
 
04:21:37.790 --> 04:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
of entity that you're talking about
 
04:21:43.070 --> 04:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:46.830 --> 04:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
M the beginning of your Mike
 
04:21:49.149 --> 04:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
Mike uh again thank you for being here
 
04:21:51.149 --> 04:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
in the beginning of your presentation
 
04:21:52.950 --> 04:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
you mentioned some of the places where
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
you thought that this uh existing uh law
 
04:21:59.309 --> 04:21:59.319 align:start position:0%
was not adequate whether you should
 
04:22:01.870 --> 04:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
change this this this and that do you
 
04:22:05.670 --> 04:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
have a maybe an outline of an amendment
 
04:22:08.109 --> 04:22:08.119 align:start position:0%
that would cover your your concerns that
 
04:22:09.990 --> 04:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
we could take a look at or do you have
 
04:22:13.109 --> 04:22:13.119 align:start position:0%
in writing that we could look at of what
 
04:22:16.710 --> 04:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
you just said um I don't have anything
 
04:22:18.630 --> 04:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
in writing right at the moment I could
 
04:22:20.149 --> 04:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
develop something it would be pretty
 
04:22:22.469 --> 04:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
extensive though for the two bills that
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
1502 and 1504 um I'm sorry oh I'm sorry
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay yeah um so I don't
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
have anything in writing right now um
 
04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
but I we are we we have done the
 
04:22:35.830 --> 04:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
analysis and gone essentially line by
 
04:22:39.229 --> 04:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
line um on 1502 and 1504 to figure out
 
04:22:41.389 --> 04:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
what would need to change so so we could
 
04:22:44.550 --> 04:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
get that yeah yeah absolutely yep
 
04:22:44.560 --> 04:22:46.349 align:start position:0%
get that yeah yeah absolutely yep
representative

04:22:46.349 --> 04:22:46.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:22:49.870 --> 04:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
able thank you and thank you for for
 
04:22:54.950 --> 04:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
testifying um under under
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh house bill
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
f502 um what would be the
 
04:23:06.870 --> 04:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh what would be the RSA or the uh
 
04:23:09.229 --> 04:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
the division of the banking Department
 
04:23:12.510 --> 04:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
that would would control regulating this
 
04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
kind of an
 
04:23:17.870 --> 04:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
Endeavor sorry go ahead didn't mean to
 
04:23:21.710 --> 04:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
cut you off um so we currently as
 
04:23:23.429 --> 04:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
contemplated by the fiscal note we don't
 
04:23:24.990 --> 04:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about the three bills
 
04:23:26.870 --> 04:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
kind of working together to create a new
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory regime we do not currently
 
04:23:31.149 --> 04:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
have a division that could absorb this
 
04:23:32.910 --> 04:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
type of work that's why we put in the
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that we would basically need
 
04:23:36.269 --> 04:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
to establish a new division create
 
04:23:38.309 --> 04:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
create all the training get the exam
 
04:23:39.950 --> 04:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
program up and running it would be quite
 
04:23:41.109 --> 04:23:41.119 align:start position:0%
the Endeavor because we don't have a
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:48.510 --> 04:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
now okay great thank you very much thank
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:02.070 --> 04:24:02.080 align:start position:0%

name is Christine Merill and I'm
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Bankers
 
04:24:47.070 --> 04:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
Association um and with me today is also
 
04:24:49.870 --> 04:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
Ryan hail uh VP government relations for
 
04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Bankers um we
 
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
represent 38 member banks which employ
 
04:24:56.389 --> 04:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
nearly 6,000 employees and we are here
 
04:24:58.990 --> 04:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
today to provide testimony um opposing
 
04:25:03.109 --> 04:25:03.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1502 um we understand what it
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
is that um the sponsor is trying to do
 
04:25:08.429 --> 04:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
and we're very appreciative of that um
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know in a world that is becoming
 
04:25:12.830 --> 04:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
more reliant on digital transactions
 
04:25:14.309 --> 04:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
this is an area that our members are
 
04:25:16.389 --> 04:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
very interested in and we think they
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
would benefit from additional regulation
 
04:25:21.870 --> 04:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
um our major concerns with the
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
legislation are really because it amends
 
04:25:26.309 --> 04:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
The Uniform Commercial Code I know
 
04:25:27.870 --> 04:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
that's been talked about a little bit um
 
04:25:30.830 --> 04:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
and specifically article 9 UM outside of
 
04:25:32.269 --> 04:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
the uniform law
 
04:25:34.710 --> 04:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
commission um and in doing so we believe
 
04:25:36.630 --> 04:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
it undermines the uniformity
 
04:25:39.309 --> 04:25:39.319 align:start position:0%
that is really Central to the UN Uniform
 
04:25:41.910 --> 04:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
Commercial Code um the uniform law
 
04:25:43.630 --> 04:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
commission and I apologize if you're
 
04:25:45.950 --> 04:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
already aw but for those who are not um
 
04:25:47.790 --> 04:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
they have a long history of working to
 
04:25:49.550 --> 04:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
ensure commercial transactions are
 
04:25:51.590 --> 04:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
treated with uniformity among the
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
various States uh the uniform law
 
04:25:55.269 --> 04:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
commission has been working over the
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
past couple years um specifically to
 
04:26:00.070 --> 04:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
address emerging Technologies um
 
04:26:02.710 --> 04:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
including how digital assets are treated
 
04:26:04.389 --> 04:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
to ensure the laws governing these
 
04:26:06.670 --> 04:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
assets are reliable and pred predictable
 
04:26:06.680 --> 04:26:07.910 align:start position:0%
assets are reliable and pred predictable
across

04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
across
 
04:26:10.149 --> 04:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions they have uh a working
 
04:26:12.510 --> 04:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
group currently with over 20 members
 
04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
they each represent various states to
 
04:26:17.790 --> 04:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
create a new article 12 to address this
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
they um have told us they are expecting
 
04:26:21.990 --> 04:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
to wrap up their work later this year
 
04:26:24.990 --> 04:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
and um they've released an initial draft
 
04:26:26.790 --> 04:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
which is grounded in their expertise in
 
04:26:29.550 --> 04:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
this complicated and evolving area I've
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
included along with my testimony a memo
 
04:26:33.670 --> 04:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
from the ulc that outlines the work
 
04:26:36.030 --> 04:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing um and they also very
 
04:26:37.710 --> 04:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
specifically address the concerns with
 
04:26:40.630 --> 04:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
house 1502 and I can in no way say
 
04:26:42.189 --> 04:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
explain it better than they do so I
 
04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to take a look at
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
that we also have other information for
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
you about um the uniform uniform law
 
04:26:51.510 --> 04:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
commission the UCC has been adopted in
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
uniformity in nearly every state and
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly important to the
 
04:26:57.030 --> 04:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
business of banking by providing Clarity
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
around the different types of
 
04:27:00.189 --> 04:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
transactions and services offered by
 
04:27:01.990 --> 04:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
Banks um and that also includes
 
04:27:04.590 --> 04:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
commercial lending it defines how
 
04:27:06.269 --> 04:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
security interests can be granted Ed
 
04:27:08.189 --> 04:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
perfected and transferred in property
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
for lenders article 9 identifies and
 
04:27:12.790 --> 04:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
differentiates types of collateral and
 
04:27:14.309 --> 04:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
provides a definition for the different
 
04:27:17.349 --> 04:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
types of assets and making changes um
 
04:27:19.510 --> 04:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
outside of that well vetted process on
 
04:27:22.510 --> 04:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc basis will create confusion um
 
04:27:24.109 --> 04:27:24.119 align:start position:0%
and we're concerned it has the potential
 
04:27:27.189 --> 04:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
to invite cross jurisdiction litigation
 
04:27:28.670 --> 04:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
due to the inconsistencies in the
 
04:27:30.870 --> 04:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
different states so we are of the
 
04:27:33.590 --> 04:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
opinion um that the changes to the uccc
 
04:27:35.910 --> 04:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
should not out not should not occur out
 
04:27:39.950 --> 04:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:42.510 --> 04:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
established um to us the the ulc is
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
vitally important by providing clear and
 
04:27:45.630 --> 04:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
consistent rules and procedures across
 
04:27:47.469 --> 04:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
the country to ensure uniformity across
 
04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
all 50 states but at the same time they
 
04:27:52.269 --> 04:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
look at each State's unique environment
 
04:27:54.349 --> 04:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
they have Commissioners from every state
 
04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
that have a voice in the process and
 
04:27:57.750 --> 04:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
that includes New Hampshire um I think
 
04:27:59.229 --> 04:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
we've included this for you but over the
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
years going back to 1909 New Hampshire
 
04:28:05.149 --> 04:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
has adopted 102 of their uniform acts um
 
04:28:06.710 --> 04:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
and so we've got that information for
 
04:28:08.670 --> 04:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
you again we appreciate what it is that
 
04:28:10.950 --> 04:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is trying to do um but we
 
04:28:12.790 --> 04:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
would ask that the committee hold off on
 
04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
passing this bill and wait for the ulc
 
04:28:18.189 --> 04:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
to complete their work um which is
 
04:28:20.349 --> 04:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
coming as we've said and uh we would ask
 
04:28:22.349 --> 04:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
for you all to vote in our own study or
 
04:28:24.590 --> 04:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate and with that
 
04:28:26.429 --> 04:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
we will attempt to answer any questions
 
04:28:30.510 --> 04:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:35.469 --> 04:28:35.479 align:start position:0%
have um I've heard I've heard today uh
 
04:28:39.750 --> 04:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
some information as to um how the uh uh
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin goes into dollars and dollars go
 
04:28:44.630 --> 04:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
back into Bitcoin which I wasn't clear
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
about I'm just concerned and I'll repeat
 
04:28:49.149 --> 04:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
this until I get an answer that
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
satisfies me I I'm concerned about the
 
04:28:57.830 --> 04:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh ability to launder money and um I
 
04:29:00.990 --> 04:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
heard that there's there's a two
 
04:29:05.309 --> 04:29:05.319 align:start position:0%
key uh deal with the Bitcoin uh which I
 
04:29:07.870 --> 04:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
was under A Ware of and I'm not sure
 
04:29:10.910 --> 04:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what that means but but the fact
 
04:29:15.990 --> 04:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
is uh uh I haven't read any huge front
 
04:29:19.269 --> 04:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
page news events of a money launderers
 
04:29:21.030 --> 04:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
being arrested and thrown in the
 
04:29:23.790 --> 04:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
penitentiary so even though it's
 
04:29:26.189 --> 04:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
apparently very clear that Bitcoin is
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
more secure it hasn't occurred yet uh in
 
04:29:31.389 --> 04:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
the system
 
04:29:33.950 --> 04:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
so what is do you have any concerns
 
04:29:36.510 --> 04:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
about the ability of Bitcoin to be used
 
04:29:40.070 --> 04:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
in uh uh laundering money from Bitcoin
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
into dollars and back again um thank you
 
04:29:45.309 --> 04:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
for the question representative um just
 
04:29:47.109 --> 04:29:47.119 align:start position:0%
speaking to I know you made the comment
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
about nothing sort of Nefarious being
 
04:29:51.790 --> 04:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
reported um it's my understanding there
 
04:29:53.870 --> 04:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
was something that was reported um in
 
04:29:55.189 --> 04:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
the western part of the state I believe
 
04:29:58.469 --> 04:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
last year but um as it relates to
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
bitcoin and the security around it I
 
04:30:03.109 --> 04:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
think with all of the um various virtual
 
04:30:05.309 --> 04:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
currencies um and it's this is difficult
 
04:30:07.070 --> 04:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
to talk about because there's three
 
04:30:08.389 --> 04:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
bills and I know they are kind of
 
04:30:12.030 --> 04:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
interrelated but um I think the short
 
04:30:16.630 --> 04:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
answer is yes and um I think some of the
 
04:30:18.389 --> 04:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
regulatory schemes that are in place
 
04:30:21.149 --> 04:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
today for banks help provide safeguards
 
04:30:23.189 --> 04:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
against that and so what you'll hear
 
04:30:24.950 --> 04:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
from us and the other um on the other
 
04:30:27.429 --> 04:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
bills as well is that we're advocating
 
04:30:30.790 --> 04:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
for um similar treatment that Banks
 
04:30:33.710 --> 04:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
receive in some aspects Banks today are
 
04:30:35.710 --> 04:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
um subject to the rules of finsen which
 
04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
they specifically look at anti-money
 
04:30:39.790 --> 04:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
laundering and and things like that and
 
04:30:42.229 --> 04:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
so banks have very specific protocols
 
04:30:44.670 --> 04:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
that they have to follow to um avoid
 
04:30:46.030 --> 04:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
anti-money laundering and things like
 
04:30:48.910 --> 04:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
that so um the short answer is yes um we
 
04:30:50.269 --> 04:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
think that banks have a regulatory
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
scheme in place to address those
 
04:30:54.269 --> 04:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
concerns and so that's why we would
 
04:30:57.910 --> 04:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
Advocate that um in working with virtual
 
04:31:00.149 --> 04:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
and digital currencies that they also be
 
04:31:02.670 --> 04:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
subject to some of these uh same
 
04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory uh Frameworks so those
 
04:31:08.590 --> 04:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
protections are added so I hope that
 
04:31:09.630 --> 04:31:09.640 align:start position:0%
answers I don't if you want to add
 
04:31:11.389 --> 04:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
anything to that you could clear it a
 
04:31:13.389 --> 04:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
little bit the the the uh further
 
04:31:17.950 --> 04:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
question further question yes sir uh um
 
04:31:20.550 --> 04:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
the banks themselves had some uh
 
04:31:20.560 --> 04:31:22.070 align:start position:0%
the banks themselves had some uh
anti-money

04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
anti-money
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
laundering uh
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
techniques uh do they
 
04:31:32.189 --> 04:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
apply at at this point in time to uh the
 
04:31:34.149 --> 04:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency uh use of
 
04:31:36.109 --> 04:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies anywhere in the world
 
04:31:38.750 --> 04:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
actually um as representative Ammon
 
04:31:41.229 --> 04:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
alluded to there are a lot of different
 
04:31:44.630 --> 04:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
types of cryptocurrency and the issue of
 
04:31:47.429 --> 04:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
um addressing how secure it is or
 
04:31:49.550 --> 04:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
addressing criminal activity is still
 
04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
being debated and I think that's what
 
04:31:52.870 --> 04:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
this is an important conversation to
 
04:31:56.189 --> 04:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
have um in at the federal level you know
 
04:31:58.950 --> 04:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
you're seeing debates between um the
 
04:32:02.710 --> 04:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
cftc and the SEC in terms of what what
 
04:32:04.910 --> 04:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
is it is it is a security should it be
 
04:32:06.750 --> 04:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
regulated by the SEC is it something
 
04:32:08.309 --> 04:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
else should it be regulated by something
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
else those are some of the questions
 
04:32:12.790 --> 04:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
that have not yet been answered um that
 
04:32:15.070 --> 04:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
I that we believe would be helpful so I
 
04:32:17.349 --> 04:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
think we are looking to the feds um we
 
04:32:20.070 --> 04:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire in its own
 
04:32:21.950 --> 04:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
uniqueness and individuality has the
 
04:32:24.189 --> 04:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to move in the space but as
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
it relates to this we think it's really
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
important to answer some of these
 
04:32:28.189 --> 04:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
questions at a federal
 
04:32:31.229 --> 04:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
level thank you representative
 
04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
gson thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
for your your answers this has been
 
04:32:37.630 --> 04:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
quite a uh quite a discussion and we
 
04:32:41.149 --> 04:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
still have two more bills to go uh you
 
04:32:43.109 --> 04:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
you briefly
 
04:32:46.349 --> 04:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh that the that there are
 
04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
some states that have not yet adopted
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
the Uniform Commercial Code therefore it
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
is not uniform uh it's sort of uniform
 
04:32:58.630 --> 04:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
so which states have not adopted the
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
Uniform Commercial Code articles and if
 
04:33:04.670 --> 04:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
we were to wait for the the UCC this
 
04:33:06.910 --> 04:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
article 12 to be released or whatever
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to wait on uh how does New
 
04:33:12.750 --> 04:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gain any kind of advantage
 
04:33:15.269 --> 04:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
over any other states or any other
 
04:33:18.429 --> 04:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions by waiting how do we how
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
do we bring ourselves to the Forefront
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
if we
 
04:33:25.590 --> 04:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
wait I think that's really a um a policy
 
04:33:28.269 --> 04:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
question that you all need to decide um
 
04:33:29.990 --> 04:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of the states that haven't
 
04:33:31.629 --> 04:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
adopted the UCC I don't know what they
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
are I would never profess to be an
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
expert in that um I would have to defer
 
04:33:36.990 --> 04:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
to the commission and I have to look
 
04:33:38.029 --> 04:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
that up I don't know if you know that
 
04:33:39.869 --> 04:33:39.879 align:start position:0%
information no I just know it's nearly
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
all 50 states that have adopted and um
 
04:33:46.429 --> 04:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
and I do know yeah go ahead excuse me
 
04:33:47.990 --> 04:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
from from what we've been told the
 
04:33:51.269 --> 04:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
states that have adop like Wyoming have
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
um it's our understanding that they plan
 
04:33:58.109 --> 04:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
to amend it to um fix the problems that
 
04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
um amending article 9 and adopt the work
 
04:34:03.789 --> 04:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
of the ulc so that again from what we've
 
04:34:05.990 --> 04:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
been told that is the plan
 
04:34:07.750 --> 04:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
but just to add to that representative
 
04:34:09.789 --> 04:34:09.799 align:start position:0%
um I want to clarify that um I think
 
04:34:11.910 --> 04:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's you know I I know New Hampshire has
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
done a really good job of being at the
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
Forefront of certain things and so we
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
are not opposed to um to embracing
 
04:34:22.109 --> 04:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency technology by any means
 
04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
um so I think in our view the the it's a
 
04:34:28.670 --> 04:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
very complicated question but it's just
 
04:34:30.269 --> 04:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
the UCC is very important to the
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
business of banking um you know we have
 
04:34:34.470 --> 04:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of out ofate banks that are
 
04:34:35.670 --> 04:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
members that do business business here
 
04:34:37.470 --> 04:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and you think about you
 
04:34:39.390 --> 04:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
know lending we have a lot of banks
 
04:34:40.349 --> 04:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
located in New Hampshire that are
 
04:34:42.390 --> 04:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
lending across state lines and making
 
04:34:44.551 --> 04:34:44.561 align:start position:0%
sure that the UCC is intact is really
 
04:34:46.750 --> 04:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
Central to the business that they do um
 
04:34:48.750 --> 04:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
you know and if New Hampshire decides to
 
04:34:50.629 --> 04:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
adopt something outside of that I think
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
there really could be some confusion
 
04:34:54.269 --> 04:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
between um what is the what is the
 
04:34:55.789 --> 04:34:55.799 align:start position:0%
standard of the law and how does that
 
04:34:58.029 --> 04:34:58.039 align:start position:0%
apply and especially if this article 12
 
04:35:01.310 --> 04:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
gets adopted later on so um so it's
 
04:35:04.269 --> 04:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
we're not um we understand that there
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
are that 's an interest in moving in the
 
04:35:08.310 --> 04:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
space it's already here there's a lot of
 
04:35:09.470 --> 04:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
activity going on that's already been
 
04:35:11.910 --> 04:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
talked about um and we're aware of that
 
04:35:14.189 --> 04:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
but just as it relates to the uccc
 
04:35:17.629 --> 04:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
concern great thank you very much uh
 
04:35:23.310 --> 04:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
having no more cards we'll officially
 
04:35:27.310 --> 04:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.199 --> 04:35:37.230 align:start position:0%
 
1503

04:35:37.230 --> 04:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.230 --> 04:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the uh blue sheet the um
 
04:35:43.670 --> 04:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
do we get the I didn't get the do we get
 
04:35:46.150 --> 04:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
blue sheet over here but in terms of
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
people signing in uh online there were
 
04:36:04.109 --> 04:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.119 --> 04:36:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
152

04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:34.080 --> 04:37:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:04.000 --> 04:37:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:34.000 --> 04:38:06.629 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:38:06.629 --> 04:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:08.189 --> 04:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
all right we'll open up the public
 
04:38:11.510 --> 04:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on 1503 and hear from the prime
 
04:38:14.109 --> 04:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor I'm sure this will be a somewhat
 
04:38:16.510 --> 04:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
edited uh introduction since we've
 
04:38:20.910 --> 04:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
already now got our feet wet
 
04:38:23.470 --> 04:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
on thank you Mr chair I I'll keep my
 
04:38:25.349 --> 04:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
comments brief uh I do want to say for
 
04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
the record that I engaged the banking
 
04:38:30.269 --> 04:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
Association four to or six to eight
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
weeks ago to ask them for input on these
 
04:38:36.230 --> 04:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
bills so uh I'm grateful to hear that
 
04:38:40.150 --> 04:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
they're uh in favor of this segment but
 
04:38:43.269 --> 04:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
it uh perhaps we could work together uh
 
04:38:45.070 --> 04:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
to find a workable solution instead of
 
04:38:48.429 --> 04:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
just killing uh the baby in the in the
 
04:38:52.429 --> 04:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
crib um so this bill House Bill 1503 uh
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:59.429 --> 04:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
specific was that non PC I'm
 
04:39:03.310 --> 04:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
sorry we used to say that back in the
 
04:39:06.269 --> 04:39:06.279 align:start position:0%
day throwing the out with the bath water
 
04:39:08.269 --> 04:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
it's all about the children
 
04:39:10.750 --> 04:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
okay so this bill deals with something
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
called a digital
 
04:39:15.670 --> 04:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
token uh and it there's definitions in
 
04:39:16.910 --> 04:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:39:19.510 --> 04:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
around uh you know what what that would
 
04:39:22.230 --> 04:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
be uh but the idea is a digital token
 
04:39:24.349 --> 04:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
that meets certain properties would be
 
04:39:27.510 --> 04:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
Exempted from our state Securities legis
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh Securities
 
04:39:31.949 --> 04:39:31.959 align:start position:0%
laws um and one of those properties
 
04:39:35.150 --> 04:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
would be that the token is consumptive
 
04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
so that means you consume it in exchange
 
04:39:39.830 --> 04:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
for a a
 
04:39:43.788 --> 04:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
service um there's there's uh an example
 
04:39:45.550 --> 04:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
there's a local example in Manchester
 
04:39:47.110 --> 04:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's a company uh
 
04:39:49.110 --> 04:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
called Library I think one of their
 
04:39:52.030 --> 04:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
representatives uh will speak after me
 
04:39:54.030 --> 04:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
um where they did just that they created
 
04:39:59.190 --> 04:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
a token uh that that uh drives their uh
 
04:40:02.430 --> 04:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
content um system so I'll try to explain
 
04:40:04.750 --> 04:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
it briefly and this is just one examp
 
04:40:06.030 --> 04:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
example there are many examples but this
 
04:40:08.830 --> 04:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
is one local example U headquartered in
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
Manchester so we are we're all familiar
 
04:40:12.190 --> 04:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
with YouTube you can go on YouTube and
 
04:40:14.948 --> 04:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
you can watch videos okay so on either
 
04:40:17.550 --> 04:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
end of that there's the content creators
 
04:40:18.788 --> 04:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
they're the people that are making the
 
04:40:20.310 --> 04:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
content and then there's the content
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
consumers the people that are consuming
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
the content what library did their
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
Innovation was they created a token
 
04:40:29.550 --> 04:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
where the content consumers can pay the
 
04:40:29.560 --> 04:40:30.470 align:start position:0%
where the content consumers can pay the
content

04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
content
 
04:40:33.550 --> 04:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
creators uh these tokens to incentivize
 
04:40:35.830 --> 04:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
their creation uh and then those tokens
 
04:40:38.750 --> 04:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
are exchangeable on an open market so
 
04:40:41.190 --> 04:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
that's one example of what a uh a
 
04:40:43.350 --> 04:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
consumpt a token with a consum
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
consumptive purpose is uh and then
 
04:40:49.230 --> 04:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
there's other uh there's other uh uses
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
for these kinds of tokens uh some of
 
04:40:53.550 --> 04:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
that some of them are to provide like
 
04:40:54.830 --> 04:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
liquidity and something called a
 
04:40:57.310 --> 04:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
decentralized exchange so there's a
 
04:41:01.150 --> 04:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
there's a project called um it's called
 
04:41:02.830 --> 04:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
Thor chain is the name of the project
 
04:41:05.230 --> 04:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
but it's a decentralized Exchange uses a
 
04:41:08.430 --> 04:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
token to to balance out the liquidity
 
04:41:11.070 --> 04:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
pool so that people can transfer uh
 
04:41:14.510 --> 04:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
their content so here's the basic idea
 
04:41:17.670 --> 04:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
these utility tokens can be used by
 
04:41:19.990 --> 04:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
innovators to create something new and
 
04:41:21.868 --> 04:41:21.878 align:start position:0%
to create an incentive system around
 
04:41:24.910 --> 04:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
some new service on the internet and
 
04:41:28.270 --> 04:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do would say if you
 
04:41:30.830 --> 04:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh if you make New Hampshire your home
 
04:41:34.190 --> 04:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
base that we will uh allow you to create
 
04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
these Tok tokens uh and you'll be
 
04:41:39.030 --> 04:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
Exempted from the from the Securities
 
04:41:41.550 --> 04:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
laws uh I believe consumer protection
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
would still apply but uh that that's the
 
04:41:45.990 --> 04:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
basic gist of this bill there's there's
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
more details in it
 
04:41:51.350 --> 04:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
but you know mainly it's the definitions
 
04:41:55.390 --> 04:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:59.708 --> 04:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
questions oh yes represent
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
West yes thank you representative Aman I
 
04:42:07.948 --> 04:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
must say of the three bills this is the
 
04:42:10.110 --> 04:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
one that I had the most trouble
 
04:42:12.190 --> 04:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
understanding and the section in
 
04:42:14.390 --> 04:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
particular I hope maybe you can clarify
 
04:42:17.390 --> 04:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
for me was on the third page uh from
 
04:42:21.030 --> 04:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
lines 7 to 20 where you're replacing a
 
04:42:24.708 --> 04:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
part of the RSA with a totally new
 
04:42:28.750 --> 04:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
section and it had to do a lot with um
 
04:42:32.788 --> 04:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
uh limited Partnerships in the original
 
04:42:35.430 --> 04:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
RSA it was that that whole section was
 
04:42:37.390 --> 04:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
totally taken out I don't know why it
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
was removed and then this new copy was
 
04:42:42.750 --> 04:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
added in could you just clarify what's
 
04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
going on there yeah I have to admit that
 
04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is a product of 's handiwork so
 
04:42:51.708 --> 04:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
they they did all of the uh
 
04:42:53.788 --> 04:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
crosschecking with the with the
 
04:42:53.798 --> 04:42:55.350 align:start position:0%
crosschecking with the with the
rsas

04:42:55.350 --> 04:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
04:42:58.150 --> 04:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
um it's it
 
04:43:02.590 --> 04:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
basically allows uh you know there's a
 
04:43:05.628 --> 04:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
there's a written agreement required
 
04:43:08.750 --> 04:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh with an investment advisor uh that
 
04:43:12.550 --> 04:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
describes these activities so it's
 
04:43:15.948 --> 04:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
uh that doesn't really clear it up so uh
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
we do have someone from the Department
 
04:43:19.590 --> 04:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
Securities Department who should be able
 
04:43:23.708 --> 04:43:23.718 align:start position:0%

thank you uh so we'll call up Kevin oin
 
04:43:48.948 --> 04:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
and Barry Glenn who are from the Bureau
 
04:43:52.910 --> 04:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.400 --> 04:44:11.628 align:start position:0%
 
position

04:44:11.628 --> 04:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:14.590 --> 04:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair pardon me uh my
 
04:44:16.470 --> 04:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
name is Barry Glennon and I'm the
 
04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Bureau of
 
04:44:21.030 --> 04:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
Securities regulation uh with me here
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
today is Kevin moin who is a senior
 
04:44:26.510 --> 04:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
staff attorney uh with the bureau who
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
will uh speak to the bill uh concerning
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh the proposed legislation which
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
essentially is seeking an exemption
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
under the Securities act uh for a
 
04:44:40.110 --> 04:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
developer of an open chain open
 
04:44:43.110 --> 04:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
blockchain uh token uh that that token
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
would not be deemed as a security so
 
04:44:46.868 --> 04:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
understanding that there is a
 
04:44:49.470 --> 04:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
complicated piece of legislation uh we
 
04:44:51.110 --> 04:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
will certainly try to answer any
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
questions that you have uh at the
 
04:44:54.628 --> 04:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
conclusion of Our Testimony so turn it
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:01.590 --> 04:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
moin thank
 
04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
you uh and thank you Mr chair committee
 
04:45:08.550 --> 04:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
um and as the chairman pointed out we
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
neither uh support nor oppose this it's
 
04:45:15.470 --> 04:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
a a very worthy topic for discussion uh
 
04:45:18.510 --> 04:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency is not going away as we
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
see with Bitcoin as we see with uh ether
 
04:45:24.868 --> 04:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
and many other types of uh
 
04:45:28.788 --> 04:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies out there um the
 
04:45:30.948 --> 04:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
sponsor had mentioned that there is a
 
04:45:34.990 --> 04:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
test that's used in terms of whether
 
04:45:36.830 --> 04:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
a particular item that's not a
 
04:45:40.470 --> 04:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
traditional security is still a security
 
04:45:43.270 --> 04:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh the hoe test and it's a pretty clear
 
04:45:46.750 --> 04:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
test it goes back uh as was mentioned to
 
04:45:46.760 --> 04:45:47.868 align:start position:0%
test it goes back uh as was mentioned to
the

04:45:47.868 --> 04:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
1940s and uh basically it says that an
 
04:45:55.470 --> 04:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
investment contract is a security when
 
04:45:58.270 --> 04:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
there's an investment of money in a
 
04:45:58.280 --> 04:45:59.110 align:start position:0%
there's an investment of money in a
common

04:45:59.110 --> 04:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
common
 
04:46:01.470 --> 04:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
Enterprise with an expectation of
 
04:46:03.788 --> 04:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
profits derived from the efforts of
 
04:46:03.798 --> 04:46:04.708 align:start position:0%
profits derived from the efforts of
others

04:46:04.708 --> 04:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
others
 
04:46:07.070 --> 04:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
and that that's essentially what we
 
04:46:09.230 --> 04:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
apply when we're looking at whether
 
04:46:11.708 --> 04:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
something is a security or not and
 
04:46:14.190 --> 04:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
whether there's been a transaction on a
 
04:46:17.110 --> 04:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
security and so I'd like to point out at
 
04:46:20.350 --> 04:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
this point we have had no
 
04:46:24.310 --> 04:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
cases uh finding any type of
 
04:46:27.390 --> 04:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency or platform or developer
 
04:46:30.350 --> 04:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
or seller or facilitator in violation of
 
04:46:32.270 --> 04:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
the Securities act we haven't had a
 
04:46:35.470 --> 04:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
problem with that uh I know I was on the
 
04:46:39.150 --> 04:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh same uh commission with uh the
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh looking at cryptocurrencies
 
04:46:43.948 --> 04:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
years ago uh we reported that at the
 
04:46:45.430 --> 04:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
time and we're we're happy to report
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
that there still has not been any
 
04:46:50.788 --> 04:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
problems um as far as uh
 
04:46:53.070 --> 04:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies or platforms we have
 
04:46:56.830 --> 04:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
not had any apply to register with us we
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
have not required any to register with
 
04:47:01.310 --> 04:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
us at this point so I just I just want
 
04:47:04.670 --> 04:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
to make that clear uh from the
 
04:47:07.750 --> 04:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
GetGo so basically we just have some
 
04:47:10.110 --> 04:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
questions that uh the committee may want
 
04:47:13.430 --> 04:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
to consider as they look at this bill uh
 
04:47:16.750 --> 04:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
and really it's about balancing consumer
 
04:47:16.760 --> 04:47:18.750 align:start position:0%
and really it's about balancing consumer
protection

04:47:18.750 --> 04:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
protection
 
04:47:21.948 --> 04:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
uh and promoting
 
04:47:24.708 --> 04:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies uh Bitcoin I think it's
 
04:47:26.590 --> 04:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
already been pointed out Bitcoin and
 
04:47:30.590 --> 04:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
ether uh are among the uh types of
 
04:47:33.670 --> 04:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies that are not considered
 
04:47:36.230 --> 04:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
secure Securities uh but what is
 
04:47:38.430 --> 04:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
interesting is they're often purchased
 
04:47:40.548 --> 04:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
as Investments uh I think we see that
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
with Bitcoin for instance with the
 
04:47:47.430 --> 04:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
Magnificent um changes in the value of
 
04:47:51.190 --> 04:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin up and down uh basically that's
 
04:47:53.750 --> 04:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
being driven by speculation uh so there
 
04:47:55.390 --> 04:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
are a lot of people who look at it that
 
04:47:58.590 --> 04:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
way uh and as an investment it it is
 
04:47:58.600 --> 04:47:59.628 align:start position:0%
way uh and as an investment it it is
very

04:47:59.628 --> 04:47:59.638 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:48:03.788 --> 04:48:03.798 align:start position:0%
speculative um and be partly because of
 
04:48:07.868 --> 04:48:07.878 align:start position:0%
the regul nature of it um one thing I
 
04:48:10.708 --> 04:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
want to look or uh point out is that
 
04:48:14.030 --> 04:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
this issue is being looked at by a lot
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
of different uh entities
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
organizations the federal government is
 
04:48:22.948 --> 04:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
looking at this uh it's been a big topic
 
04:48:24.990 --> 04:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
for the Securities and Exchange
 
04:48:28.548 --> 04:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
Commission uh it's been a topic for the
 
04:48:31.470 --> 04:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
um cftc the
 
04:48:34.430 --> 04:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
OCC IRS and a whole bunch of alphab bits
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
of uh of regulators uh so as far as uh
 
04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
Federal uh law goes any changes that
 
04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
come about uh will uh raise the issue of
 
04:48:50.430 --> 04:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
preemption um and this would definitely
 
04:48:53.430 --> 04:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
be considered I believe um to be
 
04:48:53.440 --> 04:48:54.990 align:start position:0%
be considered I believe um to be
interstate

04:48:54.990 --> 04:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
04:48:58.270 --> 04:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
commerce uh so it could raise questions
 
04:49:00.750 --> 04:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
at that point is this regulation only
 
04:49:04.670 --> 04:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
going to apply in inate which uh um you
 
04:49:06.868 --> 04:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
know it it it would obviously be an
 
04:49:09.510 --> 04:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
issue for cryptocurrency because we're
 
04:49:11.150 --> 04:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
not talking about something that stays
 
04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
within state
 
04:49:16.990 --> 04:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
lines um it's also been noted that there
 
04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
have been various approaches by the
 
04:49:23.150 --> 04:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
various states to cryptocurrency ranging
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
from Wyoming uh from which uh this uh
 
04:49:29.788 --> 04:49:29.798 align:start position:0%
bill and the other two bills have been
 
04:49:32.788 --> 04:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
drawn all the way to New York and New
 
04:49:36.190 --> 04:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
York actually required Rees uh licensing
 
04:49:39.510 --> 04:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
of uh companies that deal in
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies as I understand it the
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
uniform law commission has been
 
04:49:48.230 --> 04:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned they actually had put out a uh
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
model uh rule on this and uh it had some
 
04:49:57.750 --> 04:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
issues uh they actually told States not
 
04:49:59.310 --> 04:49:59.320 align:start position:0%
to adopt it because they were looking at
 
04:50:01.830 --> 04:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
it further so it is being looked at by
 
04:50:04.750 --> 04:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
the uniform law Commission
 
04:50:09.230 --> 04:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
so um it's certainly an area that's in
 
04:50:13.350 --> 04:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
flux and I think um you know the commit
 
04:50:15.310 --> 04:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
committee probably would want to be
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
aware that this is an area that's in
 
04:50:19.830 --> 04:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
flux that it's in there's a lot of
 
04:50:24.470 --> 04:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
discussions uh about this um and
 
04:50:26.948 --> 04:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
specifically we have some questions
 
04:50:30.990 --> 04:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
regarding uh within the statute um the
 
04:50:33.190 --> 04:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
definitions particularly consumptive
 
04:50:33.200 --> 04:50:34.670 align:start position:0%
definitions particularly consumptive
purpose

04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
04:50:37.110 --> 04:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's not absolutely clear to us what
 
04:50:40.110 --> 04:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
that means and it it's not defined
 
04:50:41.230 --> 04:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
within the
 
04:50:43.070 --> 04:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
statute uh the other thing that we
 
04:50:45.310 --> 04:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
pointed out and it's in our fiscal note
 
04:50:49.390 --> 04:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
is that um right now we have no system
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
to handle electronic notice filings as
 
04:50:56.350 --> 04:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
proposed in the bill uh and and of
 
04:50:58.030 --> 04:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
course there would be some cost with
 
04:50:59.910 --> 04:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
that we don't know what that would be at
 
04:51:03.190 --> 04:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
this point uh so those are those are
 
04:51:04.990 --> 04:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
some of the issu isues uh that we've
 
04:51:06.670 --> 04:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
looked at some of the questions we've
 
04:51:09.030 --> 04:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
looked at that we uh we hope the
 
04:51:13.070 --> 04:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
committee will uh take a look at as they
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
examine uh what would be a fairly
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
significant change to the uh security
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
statute and uh with that we'll be
 
04:51:27.310 --> 04:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:29.310 --> 04:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
questions I have a question regarding
 
04:51:31.390 --> 04:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
are you opposed or are you in favor we
 
04:51:33.430 --> 04:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
are neither opposed nor in favor okay
 
04:51:35.350 --> 04:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you just just again want to make
 
04:51:38.190 --> 04:51:38.200 align:start position:0%
the committee aware of some questions on
 
04:51:38.200 --> 04:51:39.868 align:start position:0%
the committee aware of some questions on
the

04:51:39.868 --> 04:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:43.708 --> 04:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
bill so my question is
 
04:51:46.990 --> 04:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
um is any of this activity that that's
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh contemplated here going on now in New
 
04:51:49.920 --> 04:51:51.548 align:start position:0%
uh contemplated here going on now in New
Hampshire

04:51:51.548 --> 04:51:51.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
unregulated uh it very well could be and
 
04:51:56.190 --> 04:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
again there's been no complaints there's
 
04:51:59.470 --> 04:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
been no uh requirements that we've had
 
04:52:02.230 --> 04:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
to you know you need to see us to get
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
registered uh no investigations of
 
04:52:08.990 --> 04:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
unregistered activity any any issues we
 
04:52:10.990 --> 04:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
have looked at with regards to
 
04:52:13.830 --> 04:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies is using them in the
 
04:52:16.230 --> 04:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
purchase of Securities rather than the
 
04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
actual Crypt cryptocurrencies themselves
 
04:52:22.270 --> 04:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
right I guess um you when I first saw
 
04:52:24.070 --> 04:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
the security the first thing came up to
 
04:52:27.470 --> 04:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
me was the um issue that we we actually
 
04:52:31.150 --> 04:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
tax Securities and it's a revenue maker
 
04:52:34.190 --> 04:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
to the state in New Hampshire and but I
 
04:52:36.470 --> 04:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
my I guess I want to make sure that this
 
04:52:38.350 --> 04:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
this is outside of those bundles that
 
04:52:40.310 --> 04:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
are that are offered to the public right
 
04:52:42.910 --> 04:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
this is because this contemplates a
 
04:52:45.310 --> 04:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
onetoone exch uh interaction between two
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
people and it's not a prospectus that we
 
04:52:50.470 --> 04:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
are currently
 
04:52:53.628 --> 04:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
taxing yeah sure go ahead uh that is
 
04:52:56.110 --> 04:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
correct uh Mr chair to a certain degree
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
I believe the legislation does require
 
04:53:01.670 --> 04:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
that the issuer or the developer of the
 
04:53:05.030 --> 04:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh token uh file registration with the
 
04:53:07.150 --> 04:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
bureau uh however that they would be
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
exempt under almost all provisions of
 
04:53:12.750 --> 04:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
the Securities act but for fraud U so
 
04:53:14.110 --> 04:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
that if there was some fraudulent
 
04:53:17.868 --> 04:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
activity in the course of uh of the
 
04:53:19.910 --> 04:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
activity uh the bureau may have
 
04:53:21.670 --> 04:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction but I think it is important
 
04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
to uh point out as attorney moin
 
04:53:27.230 --> 04:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh a lot of the testimony
 
04:53:29.670 --> 04:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
today I'm kind of paraphrasing you but
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the testimony today deals
 
04:53:32.830 --> 04:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
with you know with the consumptive
 
04:53:34.628 --> 04:53:34.638 align:start position:0%
purpose and how this would be used for
 
04:53:37.310 --> 04:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
the purchase and sale of of items uh our
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
concern certainly with the bureau at the
 
04:53:41.868 --> 04:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
bureau uh is that if this is being sold
 
04:53:44.270 --> 04:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
for investment purposes and being
 
04:53:47.310 --> 04:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
marketed as such as an investment uh you
 
04:53:49.390 --> 04:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
know under the Howe test as attorney
 
04:53:52.470 --> 04:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
Moen noted uh we would you know deem you
 
04:53:55.390 --> 04:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
know that particular transaction to be a
 
04:53:58.110 --> 04:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
security uh and would want to retain you
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
know regulatory authority over that
 
04:54:01.350 --> 04:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
which we would if there's fraudulent
 
04:54:04.430 --> 04:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
conduct all other matters related
 
04:54:08.788 --> 04:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
to uh the activity uh as written here or
 
04:54:11.110 --> 04:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
as as deleted in certain sections of the
 
04:54:13.830 --> 04:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
ACT uh you know would not would not be
 
04:54:15.150 --> 04:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
there well and I'm glad you brought that
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
up because um obviously that is really
 
04:54:18.548 --> 04:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
the heart of the matter of what this
 
04:54:20.070 --> 04:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee should be concerned about
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
which is the fraudulent and consumer
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
protection and we have uh anybody I
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
might you know that use my favorite
 
04:54:33.750 --> 04:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
frm and that oh yeah it's we we Reg reg
 
04:54:35.910 --> 04:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
with Securities because of the
 
04:54:38.430 --> 04:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
transaction but then what actual
 
04:54:40.310 --> 04:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
Authority do you have over what was
 
04:54:44.030 --> 04:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
going on when in terms if there was U
 
04:54:47.070 --> 04:54:47.080 align:start position:0%
some misleading information occurring
 
04:54:49.030 --> 04:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
and what is your Authority and where you
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
know and
 
04:54:53.470 --> 04:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
whereas my attitude is right now it's
 
04:54:56.788 --> 04:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
all under the it it cannot regulate you
 
04:54:58.390 --> 04:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
cannot you know you would not be
 
04:55:00.150 --> 04:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
protecting them they would be under the
 
04:55:02.670 --> 04:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act and my fear
 
04:55:04.270 --> 04:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
anytime when we have this registration
 
04:55:06.030 --> 04:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
is that that's the you know the
 
04:55:07.910 --> 04:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
campell's nose Under the Tent of trying
 
04:55:09.910 --> 04:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
to pretend like oh I'm regulated but I'm
 
04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
not really regulated so is as you when
 
04:55:16.868 --> 04:55:16.878 align:start position:0%
you read this language here do you see
 
04:55:18.868 --> 04:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
that potential exposure that we had
 
04:55:18.878 --> 04:55:19.628 align:start position:0%
that potential exposure that we had
under

04:55:19.628 --> 04:55:19.638 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:55:23.750 --> 04:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
FM I I would point out that it's not a
 
04:55:25.948 --> 04:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
full registration that would occur under
 
04:55:28.030 --> 04:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
the statute it's it's what's referred to
 
04:55:30.510 --> 04:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
as a notice filing registration and
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
essentially what it means is that while
 
04:55:35.910 --> 04:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
we get get a notification that this
 
04:55:38.788 --> 04:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
organization is operating or or these
 
04:55:40.190 --> 04:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
individuals are operating in New
 
04:55:42.270 --> 04:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's not the same as
 
04:55:44.548 --> 04:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
registration where we would require
 
04:55:46.230 --> 04:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
extra information where there would be a
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
prospectus that we would go through
 
04:55:52.150 --> 04:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
thoroughly um so you know there is that
 
04:55:54.948 --> 04:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
possibility I guess that some people
 
04:55:57.708 --> 04:55:57.718 align:start position:0%
could look at this as as almost like a a
 
04:56:00.430 --> 04:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
stamp of approval that a notice filing
 
04:56:04.310 --> 04:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
has been made um and right now I guess
 
04:56:07.628 --> 04:56:07.638 align:start position:0%
to some extent uh you know the caveat
 
04:56:07.638 --> 04:56:08.788 align:start position:0%
to some extent uh you know the caveat
empor

04:56:08.788 --> 04:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
empor
 
04:56:14.070 --> 04:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
applies um so uh at yeah at this point
 
04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
um if we were to adopt this you know
 
04:56:18.230 --> 04:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
there would be that notice filing that
 
04:56:22.230 --> 04:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
we have but it it could be taken by some
 
04:56:24.070 --> 04:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
people that this gives us some type of
 
04:56:27.070 --> 04:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
authority that we really don't have uh
 
04:56:29.590 --> 04:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
the only Authority being to pursue fraud
 
04:56:32.150 --> 04:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
when we're made aware of it right well
 
04:56:35.110 --> 04:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
that Bingo that's the question so uh at
 
04:56:37.150 --> 04:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
this point if the fraud were occur would
 
04:56:39.350 --> 04:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
then you would be referring them to the
 
04:56:41.670 --> 04:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office or would you
 
04:56:46.110 --> 04:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
actually I mean it's uh again it it I
 
04:56:48.310 --> 04:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
think about how some Securities when you
 
04:56:48.320 --> 04:56:49.270 align:start position:0%
think about how some Securities when you
when

04:56:49.270 --> 04:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:56:52.270 --> 04:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
you you you join the the trust
 
04:56:54.270 --> 04:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
department they they send you the not
 
04:56:55.990 --> 04:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
big notices that you keep getting all
 
04:56:58.190 --> 04:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
the time that that you know that this is
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
fluctuated it's not secured by the you
 
04:57:02.788 --> 04:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
know the FDIC that you you could
 
04:57:05.670 --> 04:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
potentially lose everything all right
 
04:57:07.150 --> 04:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
that's not going to come with the
 
04:57:09.190 --> 04:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
consumer is not going to get that in
 
04:57:11.788 --> 04:57:11.798 align:start position:0%
this statute right because that's only
 
04:57:13.590 --> 04:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know uh that's only when it comes to
 
04:57:15.670 --> 04:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
a perspectiv so in this case we're just
 
04:57:17.110 --> 04:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
talking about that
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
notification and someone could be how do
 
04:57:22.150 --> 04:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
we make sure that notification occurs
 
04:57:24.548 --> 04:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
without the consumer being misled to
 
04:57:27.470 --> 04:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
think that uh there's there's somebody
 
04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
overlooking the transaction otherwise
 
04:57:32.590 --> 04:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
notifying them that like we do right now
 
04:57:34.110 --> 04:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
with the banking Department that has a
 
04:57:36.868 --> 04:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
big you know message there is that no we
 
04:57:38.670 --> 04:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
don't we
 
04:57:41.150 --> 04:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
aren't ensuring anything that goes on
 
04:57:42.390 --> 04:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
here and if you have a problem call the
 
04:57:47.070 --> 04:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
A's office right right yeah and and um
 
04:57:49.910 --> 04:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know again what we would do is if we
 
04:57:53.470 --> 04:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
saw activity that uh somebody brought to
 
04:57:56.230 --> 04:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
our attention we'd app apply that how we
 
04:57:59.070 --> 04:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
test to see whether it involved an
 
04:58:01.708 --> 04:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
investment contract essentially uh
 
04:58:03.948 --> 04:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
otherwise yeah it probably would be
 
04:58:05.670 --> 04:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
referred to the Attorney General's
 
04:58:08.670 --> 04:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
office but yeah I I I think that is an
 
04:58:13.230 --> 04:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
issue with our uh secur firms they have
 
04:58:17.070 --> 04:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
disclosures they need to make um and
 
04:58:19.150 --> 04:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
you're not going to see that necessarily
 
04:58:21.510 --> 04:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
in these types of transactions and I and
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
I will point out that that other states
 
04:58:26.590 --> 04:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
that have looked at this have seen
 
04:58:26.600 --> 04:58:28.110 align:start position:0%
that have looked at this have seen
situations

04:58:28.110 --> 04:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
situations
 
04:58:32.350 --> 04:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
where it's not necessarily clear what is
 
04:58:34.708 --> 04:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
a consumer transaction versus an
 
04:58:38.190 --> 04:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
investment or or it may be sold in such
 
04:58:41.470 --> 04:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
a way that it becomes an investment so
 
04:58:44.110 --> 04:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
there there are gray areas um and I
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
think you know that that's where uh the
 
04:58:50.708 --> 04:58:50.718 align:start position:0%
the hoe test gives us really a a
 
04:58:56.230 --> 04:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
very good level of um understanding as
 
04:58:57.670 --> 04:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
to whether we're dealing with the
 
04:59:00.270 --> 04:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
security or not and again at this point
 
04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
we we just haven't seen
 
04:59:02.040 --> 04:59:04.030 align:start position:0%
we we just haven't seen
that

04:59:04.030 --> 04:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative gson thank you Mr
 
04:59:08.150 --> 04:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you gentlemen for
 
04:59:11.110 --> 04:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
answering our questions in reading the
 
04:59:14.628 --> 04:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
wording of the definition of a token the
 
04:59:17.110 --> 04:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of the token that's described in
 
04:59:20.830 --> 04:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
in this bill uh it's and this is on the
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh enacting page uh under State of New
 
04:59:26.548 --> 04:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the year of Our Lord 2022
 
04:59:30.230 --> 04:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
go on down to lines 10 through 14 the
 
04:59:31.670 --> 04:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of the token is for a
 
04:59:33.750 --> 04:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
consumptive purpose which shall only be
 
04:59:36.350 --> 04:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
exchangeable for or provided for the
 
04:59:39.390 --> 04:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
receipt of goods services or content
 
04:59:41.310 --> 04:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
including rights of access to Goods
 
04:59:44.030 --> 04:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
services or content and the developer or
 
04:59:45.910 --> 04:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
seller of the token did not sell the
 
04:59:48.070 --> 04:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
token to the initial buyer as a
 
04:59:48.080 --> 04:59:49.310 align:start position:0%
token to the initial buyer as a
financial

04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
financial
 
04:59:52.190 --> 04:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
investment how is this any different
 
04:59:55.430 --> 04:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
from a gift card and is a gift card an
 
04:59:57.628 --> 04:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
investment or a security that would be
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
covered under the Securities Department
 
05:00:03.310 --> 05:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
um no I it's just that a gift card is
 
05:00:07.628 --> 05:00:07.638 align:start position:0%
kind of a gift card whereas a uh digital
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh token a cryptocurrency comes in all
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
05:00:15.910 --> 05:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
flavors um so again it and there's
 
05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
probably a way of getting it that
 
05:00:20.910 --> 05:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
because again as as been mentioned
 
05:00:23.470 --> 05:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies are here to stay and
 
05:00:27.310 --> 05:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
Regulators have to deal with that um but
 
05:00:31.070 --> 05:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
there definitely are gray areas um and I
 
05:00:33.270 --> 05:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
think you're not likely to see see that
 
05:00:35.150 --> 05:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
with a gift card
 
05:00:35.160 --> 05:00:36.830 align:start position:0%
with a gift card
versus

05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
versus
 
05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
um a digital currency that may have uh
 
05:00:44.990 --> 05:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
nuances in terms of the contracts that
 
05:00:47.230 --> 05:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh might be incorporated into the uh
 
05:00:49.948 --> 05:00:49.958 align:start position:0%
digital token uh and there may even be
 
05:00:53.070 --> 05:00:53.080 align:start position:0%
nuances in the way they're marketed
 
05:00:56.030 --> 05:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
where you know sometimes uh an
 
05:00:58.350 --> 05:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
investment or marketing and investment
 
05:00:59.948 --> 05:00:59.958 align:start position:0%
is in the eye of the
 
05:01:05.708 --> 05:01:05.718 align:start position:0%
beholder um so uh it it's again I'm
 
05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
certain that it's not
 
05:01:09.750 --> 05:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
something uh or that I'm certain that it
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
is something that can be uh
 
05:01:17.470 --> 05:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
understood but there are gray areas
 
05:01:23.868 --> 05:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:27.030 --> 05:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh I just do have one
 
05:01:30.110 --> 05:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
other thought Bitcoin has been going up
 
05:01:33.070 --> 05:01:33.080 align:start position:0%
at an enormous rate you know since it's
 
05:01:35.948 --> 05:01:35.958 align:start position:0%
in Inception and I'm wondering maybe the
 
05:01:38.830 --> 05:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
reason there haven't been any complaints
 
05:01:41.628 --> 05:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
when people invest in Bitcoin is because
 
05:01:44.350 --> 05:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
there haven't been any losses yet do you
 
05:01:46.510 --> 05:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
foresee there being more problems once
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
there losses um well I think I've seen
 
05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
some laughter over here and I I believe
 
05:01:53.070 --> 05:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's been a rough ride more
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
recently with Bitcoin okay I stand
 
05:01:57.190 --> 05:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
corrected we haven't gotten any comps
 
05:01:58.548 --> 05:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
and there there have been periods where
 
05:02:00.350 --> 05:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
there have been rough rides with okay I
 
05:02:01.788 --> 05:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of that thank you no
 
05:02:01.798 --> 05:02:03.990 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of that thank you no
problem

05:02:03.990 --> 05:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:02:06.868 --> 05:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert simple question
 
05:02:08.230 --> 05:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:02:12.110 --> 05:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
futuree I would like to know when
 
05:02:15.510 --> 05:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's sorry thanks when somebody is
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh discussing uh giving us information
 
05:02:22.590 --> 05:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
and advice from here whether or not they
 
05:02:28.788 --> 05:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency uh
 
05:02:34.110 --> 05:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
what I just want to know if they have a
 
05:02:36.910 --> 05:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
vested interest in the uh in the
 
05:02:40.470 --> 05:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
product me personally actually I just
 
05:02:42.390 --> 05:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
thought of it it wasn't anything you
 
05:02:45.910 --> 05:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
guys said I just yeah and I also do not
 
05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
own any
 
05:02:49.150 --> 05:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency and I do believe the
 
05:02:51.350 --> 05:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor did tell us that he
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
owns Bitcoin I just would like to know
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh I I knew that but uh uh you know if
 
05:02:59.590 --> 05:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
somebody comes forward and I don't know
 
05:03:01.990 --> 05:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
them I would just like to know well yeah
 
05:03:05.350 --> 05:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a very awkward question it's
 
05:03:07.150 --> 05:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
like asking anybody who cares about
 
05:03:08.788 --> 05:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine medication whether you own stock
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
and fizer you know come on you know we
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't ask each other those kind of
 
05:03:17.190 --> 05:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
questions pardon me I didn't hear you um
 
05:03:19.470 --> 05:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
it'd be like when we talk about vaccines
 
05:03:21.070 --> 05:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
should we ask somebody whether they own
 
05:03:24.270 --> 05:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
stock in fiser or Manda you know do you
 
05:03:26.430 --> 05:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
have Pharmaceutical stock if you own
 
05:03:28.590 --> 05:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
pharmac stock you might have a different
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
attitude about vaccines that's why you
 
05:03:39.788 --> 05:03:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
question that's why I ask thank you
 
05:03:54.390 --> 05:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:56.548 --> 05:03:56.558 align:start position:0%

to testify on HB 1503 uh my name is Lex
 
05:05:01.628 --> 05:05:01.638 align:start position:0%
Berney I represent Grafton District 9 I
 
05:05:03.628 --> 05:05:03.638 align:start position:0%
am a co-sponsor on this bill and I have
 
05:05:05.230 --> 05:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
been a professional software developer
 
05:05:07.628 --> 05:05:07.638 align:start position:0%
for the past two decades for the past 3
 
05:05:09.670 --> 05:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
years I've been employed at library Inc
 
05:05:11.190 --> 05:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire company based in
 
05:05:12.590 --> 05:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire and we are
 
05:05:14.430 --> 05:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
building a decentralized alternative to
 
05:05:16.628 --> 05:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
YouTube using blockchain
 
05:05:19.070 --> 05:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
Technologies uh our platform has 40
 
05:05:22.350 --> 05:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
million unique users per month viewing a
 
05:05:25.070 --> 05:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
catalog of 15 million videos uploaded by
 
05:05:27.628 --> 05:05:27.638 align:start position:0%
1 million creators today library is the
 
05:05:29.670 --> 05:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
biggest decentralized decentralized
 
05:05:32.030 --> 05:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
alternative to YouTube the 15 million
 
05:05:34.150 --> 05:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
videos on our platform are recorded on
 
05:05:36.548 --> 05:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
the library blockchain this is the core
 
05:05:38.030 --> 05:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
feature of our blockchain and how our
 
05:05:40.750 --> 05:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
tokens are consumed creators consume
 
05:05:42.670 --> 05:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
tokens in order to publish content and
 
05:05:44.350 --> 05:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
regular users consume tokens by
 
05:05:46.830 --> 05:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
supporting specific content supported
 
05:05:49.670 --> 05:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
content Rises higher in search results
 
05:05:51.470 --> 05:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
we believe our technology fits within
 
05:05:53.708 --> 05:05:53.718 align:start position:0%
the framework set up by
 
05:05:56.270 --> 05:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
hp53 unfortunately this bill is not yet
 
05:05:57.788 --> 05:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
law and even more unfortunate the
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
federal government does not have a
 
05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
framework in place to regulate a company
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
such as ours instead of establishing a
 
05:06:05.470 --> 05:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
legal framework to let us operate in a
 
05:06:07.270 --> 05:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
safe and regulated manner the federal
 
05:06:09.030 --> 05:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
government via the Securities and
 
05:06:10.670 --> 05:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
Exchange Commission has taken a path to
 
05:06:12.990 --> 05:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
squash all innovation in this area
 
05:06:14.670 --> 05:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
Library Inc like many other crypto
 
05:06:17.190 --> 05:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
companies was sued by the secc um over a
 
05:06:18.830 --> 05:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
year ago and has already spent over a
 
05:06:20.990 --> 05:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars in legal fees money
 
05:06:22.628 --> 05:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
which would have otherwise been spent
 
05:06:24.230 --> 05:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
expanding our New Hampshire office and
 
05:06:25.990 --> 05:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
continuing to build our
 
05:06:28.270 --> 05:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
platform we intend to continue fighting
 
05:06:29.830 --> 05:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
and hope to win the SEC lawsuit but
 
05:06:31.270 --> 05:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
there are many other companies all over
 
05:06:32.590 --> 05:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
the United States which which which
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
decided to settle and simply shut down
 
05:06:36.910 --> 05:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation will not be a
 
05:06:38.708 --> 05:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
silver bullet but it will by joining
 
05:06:39.910 --> 05:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
with other states that have passed
 
05:06:42.310 --> 05:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
similar laws begin to form a consensus
 
05:06:44.470 --> 05:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
on how this industry can be regulated
 
05:06:45.868 --> 05:06:45.878 align:start position:0%
and we hope that future blockchain
 
05:06:47.510 --> 05:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
startups can avoid the uncertainty and
 
05:06:50.190 --> 05:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
legal cost which we continue to endure
 
05:06:51.670 --> 05:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration of this
 
05:06:53.110 --> 05:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
very important legislation to provide
 
05:06:55.070 --> 05:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
much needed Clarity for individuals and
 
05:06:58.750 --> 05:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:01.510 --> 05:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
space uh do you have any questions any
 
05:07:01.520 --> 05:07:03.670 align:start position:0%
space uh do you have any questions any
questions

05:07:03.670 --> 05:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:07:07.150 --> 05:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative Herbert ask a question
 
05:07:09.750 --> 05:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
this is a question right
 
05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes um could you tell me what you do
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
again I didn't quite get it I didn't
 
05:07:17.430 --> 05:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
understand what you your service is oh
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
our service so uh are you familiar with
 
05:07:23.070 --> 05:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
YouTube sure okay so we're we're a
 
05:07:24.270 --> 05:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
competitor to YouTube That's
 
05:07:26.750 --> 05:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
decentralized where instead of having to
 
05:07:28.628 --> 05:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
go to a website to watch the video you
 
05:07:31.390 --> 05:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
can uh watch the videos using your
 
05:07:33.390 --> 05:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
computer but connect ing to other people
 
05:07:35.548 --> 05:07:35.558 align:start position:0%
who are also connected to the same
 
05:07:38.548 --> 05:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
network but there's no Central Computer
 
05:07:39.868 --> 05:07:39.878 align:start position:0%
uh where the videos are stored they're
 
05:07:41.628 --> 05:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
shared on everybody's
 
05:07:44.310 --> 05:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
computer so you allow me to avoid
 
05:07:46.590 --> 05:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
YouTube you yeah you could use this as
 
05:07:47.868 --> 05:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
an alternative it doesn't have
 
05:07:49.628 --> 05:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
everything that YouTube has but we have
 
05:07:52.470 --> 05:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
15 million videos so that's quite a
 
05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
bit good to know
 
05:07:59.670 --> 05:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative AEL yes thank you
 
05:08:02.948 --> 05:08:02.958 align:start position:0%
representative um I have to admit that
 
05:08:05.750 --> 05:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
I've was I've been somewhat confused by
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
this bill the Bill's clear but I don't
 
05:08:11.590 --> 05:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
understand what it's trying to achieve
 
05:08:13.628 --> 05:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps you can explain let me
 
05:08:17.030 --> 05:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
let me just tell you what confuses
 
05:08:22.230 --> 05:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
me uh it appears that New Hampshire does
 
05:08:26.708 --> 05:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
not uh consider blockchain transactions
 
05:08:30.990 --> 05:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
as uh or cryptocurrency transactions as
 
05:08:34.750 --> 05:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
as being uh uh something covered by as a
 
05:08:38.750 --> 05:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
as a uh security and yet we have a bill
 
05:08:42.390 --> 05:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
asking asking for an exemption from that
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
and so I'm not sure what the problem is
 
05:08:46.628 --> 05:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
since New Hampshire already is not
 
05:08:48.750 --> 05:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
considering this to be a
 
05:08:51.868 --> 05:08:51.878 align:start position:0%
security uh unless I misunderstood you
 
05:08:54.510 --> 05:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
you are correct um the issue is that New
 
05:08:56.948 --> 05:08:56.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't uh doesn't have a
 
05:08:58.470 --> 05:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
definition and doesn't regulate the
 
05:09:00.590 --> 05:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
space and the federal government also
 
05:09:02.708 --> 05:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't have uh definition
 
05:09:04.910 --> 05:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
and doesn't regulate the space except
 
05:09:06.750 --> 05:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
for the Securities and Exchange
 
05:09:07.788 --> 05:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
Commission has decided that
 
05:09:10.310 --> 05:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies are securities and so
 
05:09:12.190 --> 05:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
any company that does anything in the
 
05:09:14.030 --> 05:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
space they consider a security and
 
05:09:15.708 --> 05:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
they've just started suing every company
 
05:09:19.628 --> 05:09:19.638 align:start position:0%
that has anything to do with with uh
 
05:09:21.910 --> 05:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
blockchain so by passing this
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
legislation like I said in my testimony
 
05:09:26.628 --> 05:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
this isn't a silver bullet so this won't
 
05:09:29.548 --> 05:09:29.558 align:start position:0%
solve our problem but it's it starts
 
05:09:31.708 --> 05:09:31.718 align:start position:0%
down the path of having you know like
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
wyom in Texas right these states are
 
05:09:37.788 --> 05:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
passing legislation that um explicitly
 
05:09:40.868 --> 05:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
allows what we're already doing and
 
05:09:42.230 --> 05:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
therefore if the federal government
 
05:09:44.708 --> 05:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
tries to go in we can say well we've
 
05:09:46.190 --> 05:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
registered with the state we've followed
 
05:09:48.868 --> 05:09:48.878 align:start position:0%
all the state laws you don't defi you
 
05:09:51.070 --> 05:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
you haven't you haven't specified how
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to do it because one of
 
05:09:54.350 --> 05:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
the problems we have with with a with a
 
05:09:56.470 --> 05:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is that when we ask us to see
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
how what can we do to be legitimate what
 
05:10:00.788 --> 05:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
can we do for you not to continue suing
 
05:10:02.670 --> 05:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
us and they can't answer that
 
05:10:05.430 --> 05:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
so part of this would be we you know we
 
05:10:07.510 --> 05:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
can at least show that there's a state
 
05:10:09.270 --> 05:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
law and we followed the state law to the
 
05:10:11.470 --> 05:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
te and therefore you know we're
 
05:10:13.670 --> 05:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
legitimate so that that's that's the
 
05:10:15.708 --> 05:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
reason is is is is to regulate it so
 
05:10:17.430 --> 05:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we can say we have followed the law
 
05:10:20.750 --> 05:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
because right now we can't there's no um
 
05:10:22.788 --> 05:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
05:10:24.910 --> 05:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
regulation but in the end of the day if
 
05:10:27.590 --> 05:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
the SEC has the right to ignore the
 
05:10:31.430 --> 05:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
state law yes I mean they can but
 
05:10:33.910 --> 05:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully if there is a state law then
 
05:10:35.990 --> 05:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit you know there's
 
05:10:40.350 --> 05:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
there's a u sort of I I I guess yeah I
 
05:10:41.510 --> 05:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
can't answer
 
05:10:44.510 --> 05:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
that it just it helps right if there is
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
a state law that you are following and
 
05:10:47.548 --> 05:10:47.558 align:start position:0%
if the federal government I mean there's
 
05:10:49.070 --> 05:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
there's other laws that states don't
 
05:10:50.750 --> 05:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
exactly align with the with the federal
 
05:10:53.310 --> 05:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
laws there's compar to the marijuana law
 
05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
exactly is that at some point in time
 
05:10:57.310 --> 05:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
the other shoe could drop and the FEDS
 
05:10:59.948 --> 05:10:59.958 align:start position:0%
decide to enforce the and ignore the
 
05:11:02.270 --> 05:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
state laws but at this point so in a
 
05:11:05.670 --> 05:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
sense by passing this we would be you
 
05:11:07.430 --> 05:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
know one of the few states that are kind
 
05:11:09.270 --> 05:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
of setting the policy forward and then
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
if the federal government if the shoe
 
05:11:13.470 --> 05:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
were to drop then they may adopt the
 
05:11:15.830 --> 05:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
existing laws that the states have that
 
05:11:17.230 --> 05:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
several states have already passed just
 
05:11:19.990 --> 05:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
to kind of keep things
 
05:11:22.670 --> 05:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
saying fair
 
05:11:24.750 --> 05:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
enough no more questions thank you very
 
05:11:26.390 --> 05:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thank you sorry
 
05:11:30.670 --> 05:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
about misplacing your card okay uh just
 
05:11:33.948 --> 05:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
uh before I close the hearing um on the
 
05:11:37.830 --> 05:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh midnight uh posting of uh uh this
 
05:11:40.910 --> 05:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
hearing the remote testimony we had two
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
support and 27
 
05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
opposed and um here in the committee
 
05:11:48.470 --> 05:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
room we
 
05:11:50.788 --> 05:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
had it must be Suzanne Smith
 
05:11:52.830 --> 05:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative Smith who's in opposed to
 
05:11:55.910 --> 05:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
it uh Sarah Reid is in support Joe
 
05:11:58.390 --> 05:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
Alexander in support Lisa Tapas in
 
05:12:00.788 --> 05:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
support uh represent Mark wardens in
 
05:12:03.990 --> 05:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
support and and represent pres is in
 
05:12:05.948 --> 05:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
support with that I will close the
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing and open the final public
 
05:12:10.750 --> 05:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on 1
 
05:12:14.910 --> 05:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
154 and the sponsor will be even more
 
05:12:19.868 --> 05:12:19.878 align:start position:0%
brief I will try 6 succinct so this
 
05:12:22.708 --> 05:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation uh creates a new
 
05:12:25.190 --> 05:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
type of Charter and it's called a
 
05:12:27.868 --> 05:12:27.878 align:start position:0%
special purpose depository
 
05:12:32.110 --> 05:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
institution uh again again it provides
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
rules and protections on how to handle
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
custody of a digital asset and there's
 
05:12:41.788 --> 05:12:41.798 align:start position:0%
an expression uh in cryptocurrency and
 
05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
it it goes like this not your keys not
 
05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
your coin that that's a very common
 
05:12:50.310 --> 05:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
refrain and what it means is if unless
 
05:12:53.830 --> 05:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
you have the magic number the private
 
05:12:57.270 --> 05:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
key that represents what you own unless
 
05:12:59.310 --> 05:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
you have that in your possession you
 
05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
don't really own it and
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
um not everybody is capable of
 
05:13:08.270 --> 05:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
protecting you know of handling the
 
05:13:11.070 --> 05:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility of managing their digital
 
05:13:13.948 --> 05:13:13.958 align:start position:0%
keys so that's where these third parties
 
05:13:15.628 --> 05:13:15.638 align:start position:0%
would come in they would provide the
 
05:13:17.910 --> 05:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
custody uh you know they'd have
 
05:13:21.310 --> 05:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
procedures and practices around securely
 
05:13:24.910 --> 05:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
custody your digital asset and so the
 
05:13:26.708 --> 05:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
the uh special purpose depository
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
institution I think um the the uh the uh
 
05:13:34.150 --> 05:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
staffer from the banking Department
 
05:13:36.868 --> 05:13:36.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned that Wyoming has four of these
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
they're Bas basically a special kind of
 
05:13:40.510 --> 05:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
bank and they have four of these
 
05:13:42.708 --> 05:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
chartered in Wyoming uh
 
05:13:46.030 --> 05:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
currently um one of them is one of the I
 
05:13:47.910 --> 05:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
think the third largest cryptocurrency
 
05:13:50.110 --> 05:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
Exchange in the US which is called
 
05:13:53.070 --> 05:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
Kraken um I believe there're the third
 
05:13:56.190 --> 05:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
largest uh and binance and coinbase are
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
two other large ones but um the main
 
05:14:02.670 --> 05:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
thing about this bill um
 
05:14:05.350 --> 05:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
and you have to forgive me I don't have
 
05:14:08.470 --> 05:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
the line memorized but it has to do with
 
05:14:11.190 --> 05:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
hypothecation so basically a bank is
 
05:14:14.150 --> 05:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to take deposits and then lend
 
05:14:16.708 --> 05:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
out some of those deposits right up to a
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
certain fraction they can I don't I
 
05:14:20.430 --> 05:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly what the fraction is
 
05:14:22.190 --> 05:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
currently it might be 7% or something
 
05:14:24.350 --> 05:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
close to that so you give me $100 I can
 
05:14:27.628 --> 05:14:27.638 align:start position:0%
loan out 93 dollars and charge interest
 
05:14:30.708 --> 05:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
on that um a special purpose depository
 
05:14:34.510 --> 05:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
Institution would require 100% reserves
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
so they they're not able to hypothecate
 
05:14:39.350 --> 05:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
their deposits the way that a normal
 
05:14:41.350 --> 05:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
Bank does and the reason for that is
 
05:14:44.110 --> 05:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
because cryptocurrency it's you know
 
05:14:45.948 --> 05:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
some of it's in in its infancy and there
 
05:14:48.868 --> 05:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
are fluctuations in the price that it
 
05:14:50.750 --> 05:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
would be dangerous it could provide
 
05:14:53.868 --> 05:14:53.878 align:start position:0%
systemic risk to the system if you let
 
05:14:57.708 --> 05:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
uh you know if you let fractional uh uh
 
05:15:00.350 --> 05:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
lending happen on those based on those
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
deposits so that's kind of the key
 
05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
um idea in this bill the rest of it has
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
to do with how do you Charter a special
 
05:15:10.548 --> 05:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
purpose depository institution what are
 
05:15:12.230 --> 05:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
the you know the Hoops that you have to
 
05:15:14.190 --> 05:15:14.200 align:start position:0%
go through to Charter it what happens if
 
05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
you don't uh live up to your obligations
 
05:15:18.390 --> 05:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh what kind of recourse does the
 
05:15:22.350 --> 05:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
banking Department have to uh you know
 
05:15:24.628 --> 05:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
uh take control of your institution that
 
05:15:27.510 --> 05:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
isn't behaving correctly why would an
 
05:15:30.110 --> 05:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
institution like this be interesting uh
 
05:15:31.590 --> 05:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know why why why would someone want
 
05:15:35.390 --> 05:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
want to create an institution like this
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
um that's that's kind of a significant
 
05:15:40.150 --> 05:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
question um we're
 
05:15:43.110 --> 05:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
seeing we're seeing companies that have
 
05:15:45.070 --> 05:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
significant cash
 
05:15:47.548 --> 05:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
reserves take some of that cash and put
 
05:15:48.750 --> 05:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
it into
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency uh to protect them from
 
05:15:53.310 --> 05:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
inflation so that's one thing that's
 
05:15:56.590 --> 05:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
happening um and again it's volatile
 
05:15:58.070 --> 05:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
over the short time frame but over a
 
05:16:01.670 --> 05:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
long time frame it's uh you know it it
 
05:16:03.910 --> 05:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
goes up and down but the long time frame
 
05:16:06.830 --> 05:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
is uh is more up than down so that's why
 
05:16:08.270 --> 05:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
they do it there's a company called
 
05:16:10.628 --> 05:16:10.638 align:start position:0%
micro strategy uh they're a software
 
05:16:13.150 --> 05:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
company and they've invested hundreds of
 
05:16:15.628 --> 05:16:15.638 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars they they've taken
 
05:16:18.628 --> 05:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
their cash reserves put it into Bitcoin
 
05:16:21.150 --> 05:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
and so that would be a use case for the
 
05:16:22.910 --> 05:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
special purpose depository institution
 
05:16:24.830 --> 05:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
where they could custody that
 
05:16:28.990 --> 05:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
significant amount of uh of assets for a
 
05:16:33.230 --> 05:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
company like micro strategy um
 
05:16:35.830 --> 05:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh Speedy is is the short way to say the
 
05:16:40.150 --> 05:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
acronym Speedy um but there there they
 
05:16:42.910 --> 05:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
perform things like on an off-ramps uh
 
05:16:45.030 --> 05:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
an asset management support they could
 
05:16:47.190 --> 05:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
it could be support for again anything
 
05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
with property rights ownership where
 
05:16:50.670 --> 05:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
that can be tokenized so it could be
 
05:16:52.430 --> 05:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
real estate it could be oil field
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
equipment it could be Transportation
 
05:16:57.110 --> 05:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
assets anything that's non-fungible that
 
05:17:00.750 --> 05:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
can be bundled uh and and store you know
 
05:17:03.910 --> 05:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
the ownership proven by a digital
 
05:17:06.868 --> 05:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
token can be a digital asset that a
 
05:17:09.590 --> 05:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
speedy could custody
 
05:17:13.230 --> 05:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
um again this is a big it's not Beanie
 
05:17:15.510 --> 05:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
Babies this is like the future of how we
 
05:17:17.830 --> 05:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
prove ownership to each other uh and
 
05:17:19.510 --> 05:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be done in this this
 
05:17:22.150 --> 05:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
digital asset space and so this would
 
05:17:24.910 --> 05:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
create a I think a fourth uh type of
 
05:17:28.030 --> 05:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
Charter if I'm if I'm not incorrect we
 
05:17:30.070 --> 05:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
would have a bank credit union and a
 
05:17:32.310 --> 05:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
trust uh this would be an additional
 
05:17:33.150 --> 05:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
type of
 
05:17:35.430 --> 05:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
Charter so with that I'll take any
 
05:17:37.708 --> 05:17:37.718 align:start position:0%
questions and we do have some questions
 
05:17:37.718 --> 05:17:39.390 align:start position:0%
questions and we do have some questions
representative

05:17:39.390 --> 05:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:17:43.070 --> 05:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
Bartlett thank you Mr chair thanks again
 
05:17:46.548 --> 05:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
representative Emon
 
05:17:49.708 --> 05:17:49.718 align:start position:0%
um each of these bills relate to each
 
05:17:54.350 --> 05:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
other yes that's correct y so what
 
05:17:58.548 --> 05:17:58.558 align:start position:0%
happens if only part of these bills move
 
05:18:01.070 --> 05:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
forward well we could rectify like let's
 
05:18:02.990 --> 05:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
say definition that's not included in
 
05:18:04.708 --> 05:18:04.718 align:start position:0%
one but is in another you know we could
 
05:18:08.190 --> 05:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
rectify that so I think I believe the
 
05:18:09.990 --> 05:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
Speedy bills stand alone but I could be
 
05:18:13.110 --> 05:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
wrong okay it it does relate to there's
 
05:18:14.910 --> 05:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
similar language in this bill as there
 
05:18:15.868 --> 05:18:15.878 align:start position:0%
is in
 
05:18:18.750 --> 05:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
1502 and if you remember the the fiscal
 
05:18:20.788 --> 05:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
statement for both was the same so that
 
05:18:22.708 --> 05:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
gives you an indication of that they're
 
05:18:26.110 --> 05:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
structurally similar but the 152 applies
 
05:18:28.910 --> 05:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
to the banking industry currently and
 
05:18:30.510 --> 05:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
this would create sort of a new type of
 
05:18:33.548 --> 05:18:33.558 align:start position:0%
Bank that wouldn't be FDIC insured
 
05:18:35.310 --> 05:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in the bill that
 
05:18:37.030 --> 05:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
requires them to tell the customer that
 
05:18:40.350 --> 05:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
they're not FDIC insured but they would
 
05:18:43.708 --> 05:18:43.718 align:start position:0%
you know they would specialize in uh
 
05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
custody a digital asset all the security
 
05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's involved with that whether it's
 
05:18:49.628 --> 05:18:49.638 align:start position:0%
online security or you know maybe
 
05:18:51.590 --> 05:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's a fence around the the facility
 
05:18:53.430 --> 05:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
where they keep it whatever that
 
05:18:55.270 --> 05:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
whatever best practices there are in
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
cusing a digital asset these
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
institutions would be specialists in
 
05:19:05.470 --> 05:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
that for the question question um
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm what I'm I I think what
 
05:19:10.150 --> 05:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
we're struggling with what we're going
 
05:19:12.510 --> 05:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
to struggle with um and I'm not on the
 
05:19:14.510 --> 05:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but the subcommittee is
 
05:19:17.948 --> 05:19:17.958 align:start position:0%
going to struggle with too is If part of
 
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
this moves forward to just say putting a
 
05:19:24.990 --> 05:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
structure in place but not allow not
 
05:19:28.110 --> 05:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
pulling the trigger not really allowing
 
05:19:30.788 --> 05:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
it to happen how does that affect the
 
05:19:30.798 --> 05:19:33.230 align:start position:0%
it to happen how does that affect the
industry

05:19:33.230 --> 05:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
industry
 
05:19:35.230 --> 05:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
um the industry will go somewhere else I
 
05:19:37.470 --> 05:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
mean that's you know the industry is
 
05:19:40.590 --> 05:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
going to countries that are uh that are
 
05:19:42.910 --> 05:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
being open-minded to this type of thing
 
05:19:45.230 --> 05:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
so we're competing not only with other
 
05:19:48.070 --> 05:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
countries but with other states um so I
 
05:19:50.948 --> 05:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
mean time is sort of of the essence this
 
05:19:53.230 --> 05:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
again Bitcoin was invented 13 years ago
 
05:19:56.750 --> 05:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
so it's you know and and in uh internet
 
05:19:59.948 --> 05:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
land that's a very long time ago right
 
05:20:01.230 --> 05:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
but we're getting to the point where
 
05:20:02.430 --> 05:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
where everybody's coming to the
 
05:20:04.390 --> 05:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
conclusion that this is here to stay
 
05:20:06.390 --> 05:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's not going away you know do we want
 
05:20:09.470 --> 05:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
to be last to get on board because you
 
05:20:11.548 --> 05:20:11.558 align:start position:0%
know what would be left over for us as a
 
05:20:15.150 --> 05:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
state you know to again attract Capital
 
05:20:16.830 --> 05:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
so this is capital is very fluid it can
 
05:20:19.830 --> 05:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
go anywhere in the world it can go just
 
05:20:21.628 --> 05:20:21.638 align:start position:0%
like your internet access Can it can go
 
05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the world um and there's a
 
05:20:27.548 --> 05:20:27.558 align:start position:0%
lot of big thinkers in this space
 
05:20:29.230 --> 05:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of like a lot of the tech
 
05:20:30.750 --> 05:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
Innovation that's happening is happening
 
05:20:33.628 --> 05:20:33.638 align:start position:0%
all around around the space it's it's if
 
05:20:35.590 --> 05:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
you talk about like an evolution of
 
05:20:38.110 --> 05:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
Technology it's such a rapid evolution
 
05:20:39.788 --> 05:20:39.798 align:start position:0%
in the space and it's all based on you
 
05:20:42.830 --> 05:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
know the foundational Innovation so do
 
05:20:44.190 --> 05:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
we want to attract the capital do we
 
05:20:45.708 --> 05:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
want to attract the intellect you know
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
do we want our universities to be uh in
 
05:20:51.230 --> 05:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
an area where this is attracted uh you
 
05:20:54.350 --> 05:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
know attractive to that kind of talent
 
05:20:58.070 --> 05:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you that your
 
05:21:01.670 --> 05:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
question representative Herbert turn
 
05:21:03.190 --> 05:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
your mic on
 
05:21:07.030 --> 05:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
please so these organizations will be
 
05:21:07.040 --> 05:21:08.670 align:start position:0%
please so these organizations will be
100%

05:21:08.670 --> 05:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
100%
 
05:21:14.590 --> 05:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:16.910 --> 05:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin am I right yeah Bitcoin or
 
05:21:18.510 --> 05:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
whatever digital asset you're talking
 
05:21:20.548 --> 05:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
about it could be dollars it could be
 
05:21:23.310 --> 05:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
whatever not dollars uh I believe it
 
05:21:25.470 --> 05:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
could be gold or silver physical gold or
 
05:21:27.070 --> 05:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
silver but I don't think that this is
 
05:21:30.270 --> 05:21:30.280 align:start position:0%
being used that way in you know places
 
05:21:31.548 --> 05:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
where it's adopted
 
05:21:33.708 --> 05:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
okay I just mention the way you just
 
05:21:36.030 --> 05:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
explained it to me that's 100% reserves
 
05:21:38.868 --> 05:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
on on the Bitcoin not the other
 
05:21:41.628 --> 05:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
things they would have to keep 100%
 
05:21:44.150 --> 05:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
reserve on the deposit on the Bitcoin
 
05:21:47.350 --> 05:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
deposit right digital asset dig generic
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
term for that yeah so um I'm curious as
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
to the tax consequences so if if uh
 
05:21:59.670 --> 05:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
somebody has a an account a Bitcoin
 
05:22:02.548 --> 05:22:02.558 align:start position:0%
account and then they put some 100 acres
 
05:22:06.190 --> 05:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
of property into that account and then
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
they they decide to sell
 
05:22:12.548 --> 05:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
it normally there would be a a purchase
 
05:22:14.910 --> 05:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
price and then a tax that would trigger
 
05:22:17.948 --> 05:22:17.958 align:start position:0%
a taxable event so I'm just
 
05:22:22.070 --> 05:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
curious how that works under this system
 
05:22:26.590 --> 05:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
well anytime you sell digital a digital
 
05:22:29.110 --> 05:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
currency or asset digital asset it Tri
 
05:22:32.590 --> 05:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
would trigger a capital gains uh tax so
 
05:22:33.910 --> 05:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
short term or long term depending on how
 
05:22:35.548 --> 05:22:35.558 align:start position:0%
long you hold it so I I think that would
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
be the answer that it would trigger no I
 
05:22:38.628 --> 05:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
don't have I don't have a problem with
 
05:22:41.830 --> 05:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
the currency pipe I'm talking about the
 
05:22:41.840 --> 05:22:42.788 align:start position:0%
the currency pipe I'm talking about the
hard

05:22:42.788 --> 05:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
hard
 
05:22:46.270 --> 05:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
assets the hard asset
 
05:22:49.868 --> 05:22:49.878 align:start position:0%
um so that's I think tying the digital
 
05:22:51.628 --> 05:22:51.638 align:start position:0%
token to a physical asset is that what
 
05:22:53.670 --> 05:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I think so I think
 
05:22:55.868 --> 05:22:55.878 align:start position:0%
that's coming it's not quite here yet
 
05:22:58.390 --> 05:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
but uh in certain industries they're
 
05:23:00.990 --> 05:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
using it like to track you know Liv
 
05:23:03.948 --> 05:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
stock for instance um but down the road
 
05:23:05.670 --> 05:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
you could see that your your house that
 
05:23:08.030 --> 05:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
you live in you could prove ownership
 
05:23:10.070 --> 05:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
with that digital token and it's stored
 
05:23:11.670 --> 05:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
on the blockchain that no one can change
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
so we're not quite there yet I think is
 
05:23:17.548 --> 05:23:17.558 align:start position:0%
would be the right answer okay thanks
 
05:23:19.708 --> 05:23:19.718 align:start position:0%
well I guess the question is he saying
 
05:23:21.910 --> 05:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
is if the transaction was all
 
05:23:24.150 --> 05:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
done in
 
05:23:25.990 --> 05:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency How can there be a
 
05:23:28.548 --> 05:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
capital gains if it was never
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
transferred into dollars
 
05:23:34.670 --> 05:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's on the honor
 
05:23:38.230 --> 05:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
System go everywhere right right but
 
05:23:39.990 --> 05:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
again this is about this is about
 
05:23:42.510 --> 05:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
custody the digital asset this is what
 
05:23:44.270 --> 05:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
this institution would do that they
 
05:23:46.670 --> 05:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
would they would securely they would be
 
05:23:49.628 --> 05:23:49.638 align:start position:0%
like the Brinks Vault for a digital
 
05:23:51.788 --> 05:23:51.798 align:start position:0%
asset well but if we're going to compare
 
05:23:55.590 --> 05:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
it to a stock that you're holding the
 
05:23:57.868 --> 05:23:57.878 align:start position:0%
stock is going to pay a
 
05:24:00.190 --> 05:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
dividend that can happen in crypto too
 
05:24:01.708 --> 05:24:01.718 align:start position:0%
and so when that dividends getting paid
 
05:24:03.868 --> 05:24:03.878 align:start position:0%
it's got to be recorded and if it's paid
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
in crypto then you're going to have to
 
05:24:08.628 --> 05:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
translate it for dollars for tax
 
05:24:10.628 --> 05:24:10.638 align:start position:0%
purposes it's on the honor System
 
05:24:12.628 --> 05:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
currently but there I mentioned
 
05:24:14.310 --> 05:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
different consensus mechanisms earlier
 
05:24:18.708 --> 05:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
proof of stake you get rewarded uh for
 
05:24:20.990 --> 05:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
for taking some crypto and kind of
 
05:24:23.270 --> 05:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
encumbering it for a period of time and
 
05:24:25.070 --> 05:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
then you'll get rewards sort of like a
 
05:24:27.628 --> 05:24:27.638 align:start position:0%
dividend so that that's happening
 
05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
already right so but I think where his
 
05:24:31.708 --> 05:24:31.718 align:start position:0%
question is coming from is his concern
 
05:24:34.590 --> 05:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
is that it it create even though you're
 
05:24:37.750 --> 05:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
talking about an honor honor System that
 
05:24:40.708 --> 05:24:40.718 align:start position:0%
that I think that was uh a lot of people
 
05:24:43.590 --> 05:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
who believe the reason this technology
 
05:24:45.708 --> 05:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
exists the reason it's occurring is that
 
05:24:48.590 --> 05:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
people want to avoid taxation that they
 
05:24:52.750 --> 05:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to be out of dollars they of they
 
05:24:54.750 --> 05:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to be in this other world that
 
05:24:56.070 --> 05:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
that the government couldn't get its
 
05:24:59.590 --> 05:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
paws on and tax it you could do that if
 
05:25:01.470 --> 05:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
you wanted to but anytime there's an
 
05:25:04.070 --> 05:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
on-ramp or an offramp to a fiat currency
 
05:25:06.430 --> 05:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
that's where the government can control
 
05:25:08.270 --> 05:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
who who's doing what and that's that
 
05:25:12.150 --> 05:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
seems to be you know the that's the main
 
05:25:14.110 --> 05:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh right but you could be sitting there
 
05:25:16.788 --> 05:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
for years doing that and then when it
 
05:25:18.990 --> 05:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
comes finally time to the offramp and
 
05:25:21.470 --> 05:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
decide to turn it into to greenbacks and
 
05:25:23.190 --> 05:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
and how the hell are we going to trace
 
05:25:25.030 --> 05:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
all the transac and how to figure out
 
05:25:26.430 --> 05:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
well it's like cash right like what the
 
05:25:28.990 --> 05:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
capital gains really
 
05:25:32.070 --> 05:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
was uh a good question I don't have the
 
05:25:33.948 --> 05:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
answer to that but you know I could mow
 
05:25:35.788 --> 05:25:35.798 align:start position:0%
your lawn you could pay me in Bitcoin I
 
05:25:38.150 --> 05:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
could mow 100 Lawns and get paid in
 
05:25:39.708 --> 05:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin and then I could go find a
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
farmer to sell me a cow for Bitcoin
 
05:25:43.350 --> 05:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
right that that would never touch cash
 
05:25:45.470 --> 05:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
exactly it's possible but it's not
 
05:25:45.480 --> 05:25:48.150 align:start position:0%
exactly it's possible but it's not
practical

05:25:48.150 --> 05:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
practical
 
05:25:52.590 --> 05:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
right okay representative M well just a
 
05:25:54.230 --> 05:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
quick comment on the material that I've
 
05:25:56.548 --> 05:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
read is that actually capital gains
 
05:26:01.110 --> 05:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
would be uh easy to to trace back with
 
05:26:03.670 --> 05:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh with the blockchain so whatever but
 
05:26:07.430 --> 05:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
my question to you Mr amens is this
 
05:26:10.548 --> 05:26:10.558 align:start position:0%
speedy this could be a totally separate
 
05:26:12.868 --> 05:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh company that came into uh New
 
05:26:15.628 --> 05:26:15.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the Bank of New Hampshire
 
05:26:18.868 --> 05:26:18.878 align:start position:0%
could create a a new division which
 
05:26:21.110 --> 05:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
would be a speedy is that correct yeah
 
05:26:22.110 --> 05:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding that you could
 
05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
have a a a corporation could own another
 
05:26:26.070 --> 05:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
Corporation and that that child
 
05:26:28.190 --> 05:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
Corporation could be a speedy Bank
 
05:26:30.390 --> 05:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
second question um is there such thing
 
05:26:33.310 --> 05:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
as a Bitcoin backed credit
 
05:26:35.670 --> 05:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
card there are products in the
 
05:26:38.070 --> 05:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
marketplace that you can send your
 
05:26:40.868 --> 05:26:40.878 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin to an address they'll send you a
 
05:26:42.190 --> 05:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
Visa card in the mail and then you can
 
05:26:44.070 --> 05:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
use that Visa card to pay for your your
 
05:26:45.868 --> 05:26:45.878 align:start position:0%
groceries it would seem to me if that if
 
05:26:48.830 --> 05:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
I went over seas with a Bitcoin uh
 
05:26:50.948 --> 05:26:50.958 align:start position:0%
credit card that I wouldn't have any of
 
05:26:52.910 --> 05:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
the transaction costs of having to
 
05:26:55.830 --> 05:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
convert my currency that that is a big
 
05:26:58.470 --> 05:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh there's a longer conversation around
 
05:27:01.230 --> 05:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
that but that is the the you know it's
 
05:27:03.030 --> 05:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
to replace sort of Western Union where
 
05:27:04.750 --> 05:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
they charge you an exorbitant fee you
 
05:27:07.070 --> 05:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
can do it for fractions of a penny as a
 
05:27:08.708 --> 05:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I mentioned El Salvador
 
05:27:10.910 --> 05:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
earlier that they've added Bitcoin to
 
05:27:14.910 --> 05:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
their uh their uh you know their legal
 
05:27:17.070 --> 05:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
tender laws they have there's Al
 
05:27:20.310 --> 05:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
salvadorians earning a living in in the
 
05:27:23.628 --> 05:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
United States and they're sending their
 
05:27:26.430 --> 05:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
relatives their earnings in Bitcoin back
 
05:27:28.628 --> 05:27:28.638 align:start position:0%
in El Salvador and then their relatives
 
05:27:30.270 --> 05:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
are able to go to the coffee shop and
 
05:27:33.628 --> 05:27:33.638 align:start position:0%
buy things or the you know the market so
 
05:27:37.030 --> 05:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
that is that uh is eliminating a a
 
05:27:39.030 --> 05:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
middleman like Western Union from
 
05:27:40.868 --> 05:27:40.878 align:start position:0%
charging exorbitant fees that's one use
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
case for it
 
05:27:45.750 --> 05:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
yeah right but Rick Steve told me last
 
05:27:47.708 --> 05:27:47.718 align:start position:0%
night that it's always best to get your
 
05:27:50.510 --> 05:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
money exchange at the ATM you get the
 
05:27:51.990 --> 05:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
best exchange
 
05:27:54.110 --> 05:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
rate representative
 
05:27:56.070 --> 05:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
gson thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:28:00.150 --> 05:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon uh how does a one
 
05:28:01.830 --> 05:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
of the these new special purpose
 
05:28:05.310 --> 05:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
depository institutions make a profit if
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
they have to have 100%
 
05:28:09.948 --> 05:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
reserves where's it what's in it for
 
05:28:12.150 --> 05:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
them they would charge a fee uh you know
 
05:28:13.750 --> 05:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
they would they they would charge their
 
05:28:15.470 --> 05:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
customers probably an annual fee or
 
05:28:18.110 --> 05:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
whatever fee structure they came up with
 
05:28:20.628 --> 05:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
and in exchange for you being able to
 
05:28:24.110 --> 05:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
sleep soundly at night knowing that your
 
05:28:26.590 --> 05:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
gazillion Bitcoin or whatever it is is
 
05:28:29.150 --> 05:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
safely stored right but you have you
 
05:28:31.070 --> 05:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
have it based on the deposit
 
05:28:35.510 --> 05:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
If I deposit 100 million Bitcoin or
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
whatever well there's a there's an
 
05:28:38.990 --> 05:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
agency fee is that what you're referring
 
05:28:40.430 --> 05:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
to there's an agency fee based on the
 
05:28:42.190 --> 05:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
deposit oh I must have over which would
 
05:28:44.470 --> 05:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
be different yeah okay I I might have
 
05:28:45.670 --> 05:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
over overlooked that but are there
 
05:28:47.670 --> 05:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
transaction fees applied as well if I
 
05:28:50.948 --> 05:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
want to do this uh transfer from A to B
 
05:28:53.070 --> 05:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
whatever this onr onramp off-ramp is
 
05:28:54.990 --> 05:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
there is there coming and going fees as
 
05:28:57.070 --> 05:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
well because no bank is going to not
 
05:28:58.990 --> 05:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
make money coming and going that would
 
05:29:01.150 --> 05:29:01.160 align:start position:0%
be up to the terms of
 
05:29:02.310 --> 05:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be up to the terms of
 
05:29:04.190 --> 05:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
service whatever is competitive in the
 
05:29:06.628 --> 05:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
marketplace right
 
05:29:10.510 --> 05:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
yeah great thank you thank you oh well
 
05:29:10.520 --> 05:29:11.470 align:start position:0%
yeah great thank you thank you oh well
yes

05:29:11.470 --> 05:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:29:13.548 --> 05:29:13.558 align:start position:0%
represent uh I want to commend you on
 
05:29:16.150 --> 05:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
your um presentation you did a great job
 
05:29:19.990 --> 05:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you kind of explaining you know um
 
05:29:23.548 --> 05:29:23.558 align:start position:0%
the U Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies but
 
05:29:26.190 --> 05:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
my question to you is as a Republican
 
05:29:28.708 --> 05:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
representative um this is an expansion
 
05:29:31.070 --> 05:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
of government and there is a impact
 
05:29:33.310 --> 05:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
could you maybe address how you feel
 
05:29:35.948 --> 05:29:35.958 align:start position:0%
about that it's very interesting yeah
 
05:29:35.958 --> 05:29:39.788 align:start position:0%
about that it's very interesting yeah
I'm

05:29:39.788 --> 05:29:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:43.070 --> 05:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
conflicted yeah but so we we did that La
 
05:29:44.350 --> 05:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
Fair law in
 
05:29:47.270 --> 05:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
2017 and we had trouble getting
 
05:29:48.830 --> 05:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
companies to pay attention to New
 
05:29:49.868 --> 05:29:49.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because they didn't know how
 
05:29:51.750 --> 05:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
to interface with the state every other
 
05:29:54.470 --> 05:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
state had some kind of regulatory regime
 
05:29:56.868 --> 05:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
so that's really what changed my mind
 
05:29:59.310 --> 05:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
about this particular industry is that
 
05:30:01.110 --> 05:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know and we're not a big state so
 
05:30:03.270 --> 05:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know we're not Texas we're not
 
05:30:08.030 --> 05:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
California um that uncertainty scares
 
05:30:10.990 --> 05:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
away the the uh entrepreneurs in the
 
05:30:14.190 --> 05:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
space are deathly afraid of getting in
 
05:30:16.510 --> 05:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
trouble with the regulation because of
 
05:30:18.270 --> 05:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
some of the reputation around this stuff
 
05:30:21.990 --> 05:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
right so uh I think having some clarity
 
05:30:24.548 --> 05:30:24.558 align:start position:0%
in our regulations and making it
 
05:30:27.910 --> 05:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
inviting uh would attract you know that
 
05:30:30.270 --> 05:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
industry to our it's it's an industry
 
05:30:32.470 --> 05:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to be here from now on
 
05:30:35.230 --> 05:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
right and be able to attract it early to
 
05:30:36.628 --> 05:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
our state would be a benefit for
 
05:30:38.670 --> 05:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
everybody I think so that that's how I
 
05:30:41.310 --> 05:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
justify my my lack of principle that you
 
05:30:41.320 --> 05:30:43.990 align:start position:0%
justify my my lack of principle that you
pointed

05:30:43.990 --> 05:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:46.708 --> 05:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
out thank you believe you me I asked him
 
05:30:46.718 --> 05:30:48.110 align:start position:0%
out thank you believe you me I asked him
that

05:30:48.110 --> 05:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:30:51.070 --> 05:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you very much than you
 
05:30:53.230 --> 05:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry represent gon has another
 
05:30:54.910 --> 05:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
question just a very quick would you
 
05:30:56.708 --> 05:30:56.718 align:start position:0%
believe would you believe New Hampshire
 
05:30:58.868 --> 05:30:58.878 align:start position:0%
is larger in population than the state
 
05:31:01.990 --> 05:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
of Wyoming so Wyoming can do it we can
 
05:31:05.190 --> 05:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
too we can too that's a good point but
 
05:31:06.510 --> 05:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
they do have a different banking
 
05:31:09.750 --> 05:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
structure right why not so there there
 
05:31:13.310 --> 05:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
is an interesting twist that uh New
 
05:31:16.830 --> 05:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are assessment system so
 
05:31:20.350 --> 05:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
our banks pay for the Department same
 
05:31:23.470 --> 05:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
with insurance but Vermont for instance
 
05:31:27.150 --> 05:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
is not in Vermont everything is General
 
05:31:31.990 --> 05:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
funds so all right uh milia
 
05:31:34.670 --> 05:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
gard and Nancy
 
05:31:34.680 --> 05:31:44.830 align:start position:0%
gard and Nancy
dagel

05:31:44.830 --> 05:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:47.110 --> 05:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
Renault what do we think about creating
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:59.080 --> 05:32:01.150 align:start position:0%
 
division

05:32:01.150 --> 05:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
division
 
05:32:02.750 --> 05:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
and we won't accuse you of build of
 
05:32:04.670 --> 05:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
Empire Building here on this
 
05:32:09.990 --> 05:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:13.230 --> 05:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
you H good afternoon uh again my name is
 
05:32:14.910 --> 05:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
Amelia Galder and I'm the Deputy
 
05:32:16.150 --> 05:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioner for the New Hampshire
 
05:32:18.590 --> 05:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
banking Department with me is Nancy deel
 
05:32:20.350 --> 05:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
renad she is the director of trust
 
05:32:22.548 --> 05:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
supervision at the banking Department
 
05:32:25.190 --> 05:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our testimony today
 
05:32:27.548 --> 05:32:27.558 align:start position:0%
um so I did distribute a handout I hope
 
05:32:29.150 --> 05:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
I had enough copies for everyone if
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
anyone needs more I can can certainly
 
05:32:34.310 --> 05:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
obtain more or email them to you
 
05:32:36.788 --> 05:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking the department
 
05:32:38.230 --> 05:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
again does not have a position on the
 
05:32:41.470 --> 05:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
underlying policy of this of
 
05:32:46.190 --> 05:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
hp504 um however as a generally speaking
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is written does not does
 
05:32:49.990 --> 05:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
not align with current statutory
 
05:32:52.628 --> 05:32:52.638 align:start position:0%
constructs under our jurisdiction um and
 
05:32:54.830 --> 05:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
a significant rewrite of it would be
 
05:32:58.350 --> 05:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
required to make it work for us um more
 
05:32:59.750 --> 05:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
significant I'd say than the first bill
 
05:33:01.230 --> 05:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
we testified on
 
05:33:04.310 --> 05:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
1502 um additionally as you've noted
 
05:33:07.708 --> 05:33:07.718 align:start position:0%
there's a pretty significant um fiscal
 
05:33:11.190 --> 05:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
impact of uh this legislation as written
 
05:33:14.868 --> 05:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
um as detailed in the fiscal note um so
 
05:33:17.070 --> 05:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
what I've done is I provided a handout
 
05:33:19.350 --> 05:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
um I think most of the issues here lie
 
05:33:21.750 --> 05:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
in the fact that as you stated uh as
 
05:33:25.190 --> 05:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt stated the uh Wyoming
 
05:33:28.110 --> 05:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
structure um was taken in this bill and
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't really match what we we what we
 
05:33:31.830 --> 05:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
do with the New Hampshire banking
 
05:33:34.548 --> 05:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
Department um the handout that I've
 
05:33:37.830 --> 05:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
distributed kind of gives the highlevel
 
05:33:42.270 --> 05:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
highlights of the big picture issues um
 
05:33:43.548 --> 05:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
that would need to be addressed on a
 
05:33:46.868 --> 05:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
procedural matter um to make this work
 
05:33:49.628 --> 05:33:49.638 align:start position:0%
for us at the banking Department um
 
05:33:51.430 --> 05:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
specifically I won't read my hand out
 
05:33:54.310 --> 05:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
now but specifically um the big one that
 
05:33:55.548 --> 05:33:55.558 align:start position:0%
stands out a couple of big ones that
 
05:33:57.628 --> 05:33:57.638 align:start position:0%
stand out to us are you know I think
 
05:33:59.590 --> 05:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
what I think how Wyoming works is they
 
05:34:03.030 --> 05:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
have board that Charters banks in New
 
05:34:05.390 --> 05:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we um got rid of the it was
 
05:34:07.750 --> 05:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
called the botsy board I think the B
 
05:34:11.390 --> 05:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
ster board but at any rate bsy it was
 
05:34:13.830 --> 05:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
several years ago in 2015 I believe
 
05:34:15.590 --> 05:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
there was a significant rewrite that
 
05:34:19.628 --> 05:34:19.638 align:start position:0%
board was eliminated this bill um
 
05:34:21.590 --> 05:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
essentially I think requires a board
 
05:34:24.070 --> 05:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
like that so right now the um chartering
 
05:34:27.110 --> 05:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
Authority for um Banks or depository
 
05:34:29.350 --> 05:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
institutions or trust companies rests
 
05:34:31.548 --> 05:34:31.558 align:start position:0%
with the bank commissioner solely so
 
05:34:34.110 --> 05:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
that's kind of one big picture thing
 
05:34:37.030 --> 05:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
additionally as has been discussed uh a
 
05:34:39.628 --> 05:34:39.638 align:start position:0%
few times now um is how the banking
 
05:34:41.230 --> 05:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
Department in New Hampshire is funded is
 
05:34:44.230 --> 05:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
very different than in Wyoming so any
 
05:34:46.390 --> 05:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
reference to funding in this bill
 
05:34:49.150 --> 05:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's like taking fees or um
 
05:34:50.948 --> 05:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
examination costs that would all need to
 
05:34:54.150 --> 05:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
be reworked to match how we are
 
05:34:56.150 --> 05:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
currently funded at the banking
 
05:34:59.190 --> 05:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
Department um let's see I'm trying to
 
05:35:00.510 --> 05:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
kind of summarize because I know we've
 
05:35:03.390 --> 05:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
been here for a while um another big
 
05:35:05.670 --> 05:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
picture issue is there's um safety and
 
05:35:08.190 --> 05:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
soundness Provisions in our law that
 
05:35:10.910 --> 05:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
govern how um chartered institutions
 
05:35:14.590 --> 05:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
operate um and what we examine for um
 
05:35:16.430 --> 05:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
those are pretty clear in particularly
 
05:35:19.110 --> 05:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
in our trust trust company laws they
 
05:35:20.868 --> 05:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
don't line up they they I mean there
 
05:35:23.628 --> 05:35:23.638 align:start position:0%
might be some overlap but um we find
 
05:35:25.750 --> 05:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
that the ones that we have work best for
 
05:35:28.310 --> 05:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
us in New Hampshire um so we would need
 
05:35:30.548 --> 05:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
to really look carefully at those
 
05:35:32.788 --> 05:35:32.798 align:start position:0%
Provisions also our Provisions are very
 
05:35:35.030 --> 05:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with federal law because for
 
05:35:36.910 --> 05:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
banks we go in and regulate banks with
 
05:35:40.150 --> 05:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
our federal counterparts um and it's
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
important that those what we're looking
 
05:35:46.030 --> 05:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
for kind of aligns nicely um and that's
 
05:35:47.270 --> 05:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's not that it couldn't be done it
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
just needs to be looked over um pretty
 
05:35:52.270 --> 05:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
carefully um so that's kind of the big
 
05:35:55.070 --> 05:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
picture things in my handout um I wanted
 
05:35:57.548 --> 05:35:57.558 align:start position:0%
to mention too that um at the very end
 
05:36:00.430 --> 05:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
of the bill there's um reference to RSA
 
05:36:02.910 --> 05:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
399 G that exemption that I um
 
05:36:05.070 --> 05:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
referenced in my earlier testimony I
 
05:36:07.150 --> 05:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
would just caution you that any changes
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
to that it took a lot of work to kind of
 
05:36:10.948 --> 05:36:10.958 align:start position:0%
get that to where we needed it to be and
 
05:36:13.310 --> 05:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
I would it probably would take a lot of
 
05:36:15.548 --> 05:36:15.558 align:start position:0%
work to review the proposed changes here
 
05:36:18.230 --> 05:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
to get them to where we want them to be
 
05:36:21.270 --> 05:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
um a couple of other like little nuances
 
05:36:23.150 --> 05:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
just to you know I didn't I don't want
 
05:36:24.708 --> 05:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
to go line by line through the bill and
 
05:36:27.430 --> 05:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
point out all like the the issues but
 
05:36:29.910 --> 05:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
you could there's almost every line
 
05:36:31.390 --> 05:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
would probably need to be changed a
 
05:36:35.548 --> 05:36:35.558 align:start position:0%
little bit um so um and it's not to say
 
05:36:36.948 --> 05:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
that it couldn't be done it would just
 
05:36:40.030 --> 05:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
need some work um some big ones that
 
05:36:41.830 --> 05:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
stand out of those kind of needly
 
05:36:43.990 --> 05:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
nuanced things um putting aside the big
 
05:36:47.230 --> 05:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
procedural things uh for example and I
 
05:36:49.070 --> 05:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
apologize again I was not able to print
 
05:36:51.190 --> 05:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
out the line by line number version of
 
05:36:54.628 --> 05:36:54.638 align:start position:0%
the bill before I came here um but there
 
05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
is a part of the bill in 383 F4 that
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
references make making an application to
 
05:37:04.030 --> 05:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
become a member of the Federal Reserve
 
05:37:06.590 --> 05:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
System in order to do that you have to
 
05:37:09.948 --> 05:37:09.958 align:start position:0%
qualify for FDIC insurance and then
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
below that it talks about how these
 
05:37:14.350 --> 05:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
entities will not qualify for FDIC
 
05:37:17.628 --> 05:37:17.638 align:start position:0%
Insurance um just just you know it you
 
05:37:19.628 --> 05:37:19.638 align:start position:0%
can work through that problem it would
 
05:37:21.868 --> 05:37:21.878 align:start position:0%
just need some time to be work how did
 
05:37:23.910 --> 05:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
Wyoming work through it I don't I don't
 
05:37:26.190 --> 05:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
know I don't I don't know exactly
 
05:37:28.350 --> 05:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
because I I didn't I haven't gone
 
05:37:30.270 --> 05:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
through this line by line with wyom
 
05:37:32.190 --> 05:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
right um and it could be that none of
 
05:37:33.990 --> 05:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
their institutions are interested in
 
05:37:35.830 --> 05:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
that provision because it's an optional
 
05:37:38.708 --> 05:37:38.718 align:start position:0%
provision um you know it doesn't they're
 
05:37:40.948 --> 05:37:40.958 align:start position:0%
not requ it's just enabling the yeah so
 
05:37:42.230 --> 05:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
it could be that the four that are in
 
05:37:44.548 --> 05:37:44.558 align:start position:0%
Wyoming don't aren't interested in that
 
05:37:46.510 --> 05:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
but you know it is a Nuance that you
 
05:37:48.868 --> 05:37:48.878 align:start position:0%
have to be aware of
 
05:37:52.948 --> 05:37:52.958 align:start position:0%
um uh let's see some other issues um so
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to address um currently
 
05:37:58.310 --> 05:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
under current law the um New Hampshire
 
05:38:00.270 --> 05:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
banking Department charters has two
 
05:38:03.470 --> 05:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
Charter types A State Bank and a credit
 
05:38:06.270 --> 05:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
union underneath a State Bank there are
 
05:38:08.708 --> 05:38:08.718 align:start position:0%
three types of three flavors of State
 
05:38:11.590 --> 05:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
Banks there's a a depository bank
 
05:38:14.310 --> 05:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
there's a Trust Company trust a non-
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
depository trust company and then
 
05:38:17.830 --> 05:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
there's a Family Trust Company um a
 
05:38:19.910 --> 05:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
private Family Trust Company so I would
 
05:38:22.150 --> 05:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
assume that you would want to put this
 
05:38:24.230 --> 05:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
somehow under the def the umbrella of a
 
05:38:27.190 --> 05:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
state bank to make it work but that's
 
05:38:30.230 --> 05:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
that needs to be reconciled
 
05:38:34.350 --> 05:38:34.360 align:start position:0%
um with the bill currently
 
05:38:37.948 --> 05:38:37.958 align:start position:0%
um no let's it contemplate now it seems
 
05:38:40.548 --> 05:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
to contemplate it seems I yeah seems to
 
05:38:42.628 --> 05:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
contemplate a separate Standalone
 
05:38:46.190 --> 05:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
Charter type okay um maybe maybe that's
 
05:38:48.628 --> 05:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
appropriate um but I I frankly I think
 
05:38:50.548 --> 05:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
that is yeah I mean I I don't want
 
05:38:52.390 --> 05:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
anybody to be confused that they're a
 
05:38:54.948 --> 05:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
bank so I would almost change you know
 
05:38:56.350 --> 05:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
so you might want to I would almost
 
05:38:58.430 --> 05:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
require that they they write
 
05:38:58.440 --> 05:39:00.190 align:start position:0%
require that they they write
SD

05:39:00.190 --> 05:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
SD
 
05:39:02.910 --> 05:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
in their name yep almost yeah and I
 
05:39:05.190 --> 05:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
think that to the extent this interplays
 
05:39:08.390 --> 05:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
with 1502 that references just a bank
 
05:39:09.948 --> 05:39:09.958 align:start position:0%
you might want to just you just got to
 
05:39:11.548 --> 05:39:11.558 align:start position:0%
be mindful of all these Bank references
 
05:39:12.990 --> 05:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
we don't like that word we don't want
 
05:39:14.590 --> 05:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
them anybody to think they're a bank
 
05:39:17.548 --> 05:39:17.558 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so I you know again it's just
 
05:39:19.390 --> 05:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
a Nuance that would need to be
 
05:39:19.400 --> 05:39:21.230 align:start position:0%
a Nuance that would need to be
contemplated

05:39:21.230 --> 05:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
contemplated
 
05:39:21.240 --> 05:39:23.310 align:start position:0%
contemplated
um

05:39:23.310 --> 05:39:23.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:27.788 --> 05:39:27.798 align:start position:0%
so I I could keep going with issues but
 
05:39:30.110 --> 05:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
um but I'm happy to to answer any
 
05:39:32.270 --> 05:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
questions you may have um certainly how
 
05:39:34.110 --> 05:39:34.120 align:start position:0%
long will it take you to make it to make
 
05:39:37.868 --> 05:39:37.878 align:start position:0%
it work uh well we'd have to go like I
 
05:39:39.750 --> 05:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
said if you saw my if you could see my
 
05:39:41.788 --> 05:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
notes on this it's almost every chunk
 
05:39:44.948 --> 05:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
needs something um changing a little bit
 
05:39:48.270 --> 05:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
you know it's not it's not unworkable um
 
05:39:49.830 --> 05:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
certainly Wyoming doesn't we have a good
 
05:39:51.350 --> 05:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
relationship with Wyoming and can talk
 
05:39:53.150 --> 05:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
to them and kind of work through some of
 
05:39:54.350 --> 05:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
these issues but some of it is just
 
05:39:55.788 --> 05:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
fundamentally Wyoming just runs
 
05:39:59.030 --> 05:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
differently than New Hampshire um so it
 
05:40:01.110 --> 05:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
would takes some some some pretty
 
05:40:03.468 --> 05:40:03.478 align:start position:0%
significant work I I am shocked about
 
05:40:07.590 --> 05:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
the 91a piece you that is unbelievable
 
05:40:09.110 --> 05:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's an issue that needs
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
to be thought about did that W said did
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
did they see I'm not I haven't gone line
 
05:40:16.910 --> 05:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
by line and compared um uh so a lot of
 
05:40:18.548 --> 05:40:18.558 align:start position:0%
this you haven't really seen what's
 
05:40:20.190 --> 05:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
their actual statue well I haven't like
 
05:40:21.948 --> 05:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
lined it up like one for one we've
 
05:40:23.868 --> 05:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
talked to Wyoming in pretty broad terms
 
05:40:26.030 --> 05:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
about it but in terms of really going
 
05:40:28.548 --> 05:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
line by line you know I I don't know and
 
05:40:29.708 --> 05:40:29.718 align:start position:0%
I don't know what they're policy
 
05:40:32.070 --> 05:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
considerations were if they did make
 
05:40:34.150 --> 05:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
that call
 
05:40:34.160 --> 05:40:36.990 align:start position:0%
that call
um

05:40:36.990 --> 05:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:40.070 --> 05:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
so okay um and I'm happy to answer any
 
05:40:42.548 --> 05:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
questions I am and I have Nancy who's my
 
05:40:44.510 --> 05:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
expert in trust companies to the extent
 
05:40:47.070 --> 05:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
there's overlap right well and I would
 
05:40:48.868 --> 05:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
say that as the sponsor of the original
 
05:40:52.628 --> 05:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
trust law um it was in in that case it
 
05:40:54.990 --> 05:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
was different I wasn't we weren't
 
05:40:57.030 --> 05:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
lifting it from some other place we
 
05:40:59.310 --> 05:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
actually had a room full of trust
 
05:41:02.030 --> 05:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
lawyers it was a double room like this
 
05:41:03.910 --> 05:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
and it was packed full of lawyers and
 
05:41:05.628 --> 05:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
they literally you know we went through
 
05:41:07.990 --> 05:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
every piece but we were building on the
 
05:41:10.230 --> 05:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
case law we were building on what is was
 
05:41:12.110 --> 05:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
already occurring case law in New
 
05:41:14.548 --> 05:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in this case we're it's there
 
05:41:17.350 --> 05:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
is no case law right has been any case
 
05:41:20.110 --> 05:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
law and that we're now trying to create
 
05:41:22.468 --> 05:41:22.478 align:start position:0%
something that is modeling theoretically
 
05:41:24.670 --> 05:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
off of somebody else who already put
 
05:41:27.070 --> 05:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
their feet in the water yeah I I would
 
05:41:29.030 --> 05:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
add to that too that this talks a lot
 
05:41:29.040 --> 05:41:29.750 align:start position:0%
add to that too that this talks a lot
about

05:41:29.750 --> 05:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:41:32.708 --> 05:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
custody and there's lots of different I
 
05:41:34.468 --> 05:41:34.478 align:start position:0%
couldn't begin to listen Nancy's much
 
05:41:35.868 --> 05:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
better than me there's lots of trust
 
05:41:36.910 --> 05:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
companies that do lots of different
 
05:41:39.510 --> 05:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
types of custody work correct um and it
 
05:41:41.750 --> 05:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
could be that some of this already fits
 
05:41:44.548 --> 05:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
within that world I you know it we'd
 
05:41:46.430 --> 05:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
have to really understand what somebody
 
05:41:48.788 --> 05:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
would want to do to see it to the extent
 
05:41:50.750 --> 05:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
some of it might fit in Trust Company
 
05:41:54.350 --> 05:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
world I don't know um but that's another
 
05:41:57.270 --> 05:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
discussion that could be had with more
 
05:41:59.910 --> 05:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
detail good
 
05:42:02.628 --> 05:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
05:42:05.150 --> 05:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
members I guess I guess they finally got
 
05:42:09.030 --> 05:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
it all figured out now yeah or I st them
 
05:42:11.990 --> 05:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
sorry all right good job thank
 
05:42:15.030 --> 05:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you all right last but not
 
05:42:17.430 --> 05:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
least Christy Merill and Ryan
 
05:42:20.110 --> 05:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
hail and you're not really going to take
 
05:42:20.120 --> 05:42:28.150 align:start position:0%
hail and you're not really going to take
10

05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:28.160 --> 05:42:42.510 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

05:42:42.510 --> 05:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:45.628 --> 05:42:45.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again thank you Mr
 
05:42:47.150 --> 05:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and honorable members of the
 
05:42:48.628 --> 05:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
House Commerce Committee I will try to
 
05:42:50.310 --> 05:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
go quickly we also have a lot to say on
 
05:42:52.310 --> 05:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
this um I'm christe Merl president of
 
05:42:53.948 --> 05:42:53.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bankers Association and
 
05:42:57.310 --> 05:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
with me is Ryan hail um even though this
 
05:42:59.468 --> 05:42:59.478 align:start position:0%
legislation it doesn't say it expressly
 
05:43:00.868 --> 05:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it's designed to
 
05:43:02.788 --> 05:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
allow institutions to hold in transfer
 
05:43:04.990 --> 05:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
virtual currencies including crypto and
 
05:43:05.000 --> 05:43:06.110 align:start position:0%
virtual currencies including crypto and
digital

05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
digital
 
05:43:08.390 --> 05:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
assets um as I've said earlier given the
 
05:43:09.948 --> 05:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
increasingly digital nature of our
 
05:43:12.070 --> 05:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
transactions um a lot of our banks are
 
05:43:14.628 --> 05:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
open to and interested in digital assets
 
05:43:16.990 --> 05:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
and crypto and they ultimately would
 
05:43:18.468 --> 05:43:18.478 align:start position:0%
like the option to partner with
 
05:43:20.430 --> 05:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
companies working in the space and also
 
05:43:22.310 --> 05:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
to increase their their digital
 
05:43:24.430 --> 05:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
offerings um one example that I want to
 
05:43:26.430 --> 05:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
point out if you're not aware um Walden
 
05:43:28.548 --> 05:43:28.558 align:start position:0%
Mutual is presently seeking a charter
 
05:43:29.628 --> 05:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
with the new Hampshire banking
 
05:43:31.030 --> 05:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
department and if they're approved
 
05:43:33.430 --> 05:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
they'll be the first new Mutual Bank in
 
05:43:35.830 --> 05:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
decades I think actually 99 years in New
 
05:43:39.350 --> 05:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and within uh nationally I
 
05:43:41.150 --> 05:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
think it's the first in 50 years but
 
05:43:42.868 --> 05:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
they would be an institution that would
 
05:43:45.510 --> 05:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
have a primarily digital footprint so I
 
05:43:47.788 --> 05:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
think they are evidence um that New
 
05:43:49.030 --> 05:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is at the Forefront of
 
05:43:51.390 --> 05:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about these types of ideas and
 
05:43:53.230 --> 05:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
how the needs of financial consumers are
 
05:43:55.310 --> 05:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
evolving and increasing
 
05:43:57.430 --> 05:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
online um with respect to Virtual
 
05:43:58.990 --> 05:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
currencies there are several Banks acoss
 
05:44:00.430 --> 05:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
Ross the country that have made the
 
05:44:02.910 --> 05:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
decision to get in the space um just a
 
05:44:04.390 --> 05:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
few examples you may have heard of
 
05:44:06.548 --> 05:44:06.558 align:start position:0%
silvergate Bank in California they're
 
05:44:07.990 --> 05:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
one of the leading banks in the space
 
05:44:10.110 --> 05:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
and they accepted 4.3 billion in
 
05:44:12.030 --> 05:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
deposits from new and existing digital
 
05:44:14.310 --> 05:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
currency customers in the second quarter
 
05:44:17.750 --> 05:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
of 2021 Alone um US Bank recently
 
05:44:19.230 --> 05:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
announced it will provide custody
 
05:44:21.510 --> 05:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
services for fund managers and these are
 
05:44:23.230 --> 05:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
just a couple of examples of banks that
 
05:44:25.868 --> 05:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
are in the space and there are many more
 
05:44:27.628 --> 05:44:27.638 align:start position:0%
um engaged and others looking to do so
 
05:44:29.708 --> 05:44:29.718 align:start position:0%
as well and we know there are other
 
05:44:31.708 --> 05:44:31.718 align:start position:0%
banks that are reluctant to take the
 
05:44:34.270 --> 05:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
plunge until the Federal Banking uh
 
05:44:35.948 --> 05:44:35.958 align:start position:0%
Regulators create clear
 
05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
guidance as introduced this proposal
 
05:44:40.910 --> 05:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
establishes a regulatory framework to
 
05:44:42.990 --> 05:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
allow a new class of banks um that would
 
05:44:45.110 --> 05:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
be able to hold uninsured deposits has
 
05:44:47.350 --> 05:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
been addressed uh and is similar to a
 
05:44:48.590 --> 05:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
law in
 
05:44:50.990 --> 05:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
Wyoming um they would carry non-lending
 
05:44:53.230 --> 05:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
business for depositors provide payment
 
05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
services apply to become a member of the
 
05:44:57.788 --> 05:44:57.798 align:start position:0%
FED reserve and engage in other business
 
05:44:59.548 --> 05:44:59.558 align:start position:0%
of banking
 
05:45:01.350 --> 05:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
um even though it establishes a new type
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
of Bank Charter it would not be treated
 
05:45:05.190 --> 05:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
like a Traditional Bank in a lot of
 
05:45:07.708 --> 05:45:07.718 align:start position:0%
important ways um besides not being
 
05:45:09.990 --> 05:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
insured by the FDIC and we understand
 
05:45:12.628 --> 05:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor tries to address that
 
05:45:14.708 --> 05:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
um but it also won't be regulated by a
 
05:45:17.310 --> 05:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
federal agency these are very
 
05:45:19.910 --> 05:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
significant policy considerations um for
 
05:45:21.270 --> 05:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature and for you all to
 
05:45:23.070 --> 05:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
consider and uh there are other issues
 
05:45:25.788 --> 05:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
that we want to point out um this being
 
05:45:28.030 --> 05:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
coupled with the ability to apply for a
 
05:45:30.430 --> 05:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve master account exposes
 
05:45:32.948 --> 05:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
consumers and the payment system and if
 
05:45:34.910 --> 05:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
a bank fails today we know that
 
05:45:36.590 --> 05:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
consumers are assured their deposits are
 
05:45:40.430 --> 05:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
protected um through the FDC insurance
 
05:45:42.150 --> 05:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
if this passes a bank chartered under
 
05:45:44.030 --> 05:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
this new framework and if it fails it's
 
05:45:45.750 --> 05:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
unclear how the depositors would be
 
05:45:47.910 --> 05:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
impacted um and this raises concerns
 
05:45:50.270 --> 05:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
about consumer protections as well as
 
05:45:51.628 --> 05:45:51.638 align:start position:0%
subjecting the traditional banking
 
05:45:54.628 --> 05:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
system to reputational risk um I just
 
05:45:55.990 --> 05:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
want to kind of go through some of the
 
05:45:57.830 --> 05:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
other issues we want to highlight um as
 
05:46:00.270 --> 05:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
been discussed this this legislation
 
05:46:02.030 --> 05:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
places the sole responsibility on the
 
05:46:03.510 --> 05:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire banking
 
05:46:05.548 --> 05:46:05.558 align:start position:0%
Department um we've there's been some
 
05:46:07.190 --> 05:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
discussion about the fiscal note this
 
05:46:08.548 --> 05:46:08.558 align:start position:0%
will put a tremendous amount of pressure
 
05:46:10.270 --> 05:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
on them and like a lot of other New
 
05:46:11.948 --> 05:46:11.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses they're having
 
05:46:13.590 --> 05:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
their own Workforce issues it's very
 
05:46:15.590 --> 05:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to hire right now um the
 
05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note indicates they'll have to
 
05:46:20.150 --> 05:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
hire and train seven new staff um incur
 
05:46:21.390 --> 05:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
expenses totaling three and a half
 
05:46:23.910 --> 05:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
million over the next three years and um
 
05:46:25.990 --> 05:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to us how the department
 
05:46:27.990 --> 05:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
will locate these individuals with the
 
05:46:31.270 --> 05:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
requisite expertise to to provide safe
 
05:46:33.430 --> 05:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
and sound regulatory oversight um and
 
05:46:36.430 --> 05:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
just an example of this um in the
 
05:46:38.150 --> 05:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
Department's review of these new
 
05:46:40.670 --> 05:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
applications one of the criteria that
 
05:46:42.910 --> 05:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
the department has to evaluate is the
 
05:46:46.270 --> 05:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
adequacy Imp plausibility plausibility
 
05:46:48.030 --> 05:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
of the business plan of the special
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
purpose depository institution um I
 
05:46:53.070 --> 05:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
think it's obvious that this will be uh
 
05:46:55.390 --> 05:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
require a very sophisticated employee
 
05:46:57.670 --> 05:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
with expertise and and um experience in
 
05:46:59.990 --> 05:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
this field our next issue we want to
 
05:47:02.190 --> 05:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
highlight has to do with supervision um
 
05:47:04.190 --> 05:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
as also been mentioned but when it comes
 
05:47:05.830 --> 05:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
to safety and soundness a New Hampshire
 
05:47:08.390 --> 05:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
Chartered Bank they're examined every 18
 
05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
months on a rotational basis by the New
 
05:47:12.788 --> 05:47:12.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire banking department and the
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
FDIC or the Federal
 
05:47:17.590 --> 05:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
Reserve in this under this legislation
 
05:47:19.430 --> 05:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's left to the banking Department to
 
05:47:22.190 --> 05:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
establish rules on the frequency um
 
05:47:23.948 --> 05:47:23.958 align:start position:0%
that's concerning to us we think it
 
05:47:25.990 --> 05:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
should be a matter of policy to set the
 
05:47:28.230 --> 05:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
schedule for what the supervision would
 
05:47:30.990 --> 05:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
be um and we would Advocate that it
 
05:47:33.868 --> 05:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
should be at least every 18 months um
 
05:47:36.350 --> 05:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
and given the risk profile of these
 
05:47:38.910 --> 05:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
novel Technologies ongoing may be
 
05:47:41.310 --> 05:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a shorter for a period
 
05:47:44.868 --> 05:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
of time um given how fast this area is
 
05:47:47.230 --> 05:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
evolving another issue we want to raise
 
05:47:49.430 --> 05:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
is has to do with public reporting Banks
 
05:47:51.830 --> 05:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
and Credit Unions today they have to
 
05:47:54.110 --> 05:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
provide quarterly reports that are known
 
05:47:55.788 --> 05:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
um they report condition and income
 
05:47:58.390 --> 05:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
they're known as call reports so given
 
05:48:00.510 --> 05:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
the the risk profile of these new
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
technologies uh what would we would
 
05:48:04.670 --> 05:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
request that there be some type of
 
05:48:07.110 --> 05:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled public disclosure of audited
 
05:48:07.120 --> 05:48:08.628 align:start position:0%
scheduled public disclosure of audited
financial

05:48:08.628 --> 05:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
financial
 
05:48:11.628 --> 05:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
statements um moving on to the financial
 
05:48:13.750 --> 05:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
impact to the depository Banks there's
 
05:48:15.350 --> 05:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
been some discussion about how the
 
05:48:17.910 --> 05:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
banking department is funded and we
 
05:48:20.030 --> 05:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
recognize that it does create a new
 
05:48:22.110 --> 05:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
accounting unit that supervises the
 
05:48:24.948 --> 05:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
Speedy Charters um but it does
 
05:48:27.070 --> 05:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
explicitly say that the the application
 
05:48:28.868 --> 05:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
fee is limited to the cost of the
 
05:48:31.270 --> 05:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
Department's review and so we would just
 
05:48:33.150 --> 05:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
ask the question where the funding to
 
05:48:35.548 --> 05:48:35.558 align:start position:0%
set this up would come from um and
 
05:48:37.230 --> 05:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
practically speaking with just a large
 
05:48:39.190 --> 05:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and the impact of the
 
05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
department will New Hampshire Charter
 
05:48:42.788 --> 05:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
banks have to pay to help set this up
 
05:48:44.750 --> 05:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
because that would be a concern of
 
05:48:46.948 --> 05:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
ours we also just want to point out the
 
05:48:51.190 --> 05:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
effective date of um July one I'm sorry
 
05:48:53.590 --> 05:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
if my time up is that what no I
 
05:48:58.270 --> 05:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
got oh okay okay sorry about that um
 
05:49:01.788 --> 05:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
with effective data of July 1 2022 uh we
 
05:49:03.310 --> 05:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
that is concerning and we're not sure
 
05:49:04.990 --> 05:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
how the department would be able to
 
05:49:07.150 --> 05:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
staff up in time before a new Charter
 
05:49:09.910 --> 05:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
start coming in um it's our
 
05:49:11.468 --> 05:49:11.478 align:start position:0%
understanding in Wyoming just a few
 
05:49:14.830 --> 05:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
months after this became law they began
 
05:49:17.270 --> 05:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
um they started receiving
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
applications so I think ultimately a
 
05:49:21.910 --> 05:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
question for us is why this legislation
 
05:49:24.750 --> 05:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
is needed um it appears that this would
 
05:49:27.230 --> 05:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
create a new type of Bank um that does
 
05:49:28.468 --> 05:49:28.478 align:start position:0%
not have the oversight of federal
 
05:49:30.910 --> 05:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulators but would have access
 
05:49:32.468 --> 05:49:32.478 align:start position:0%
to the FED
 
05:49:34.830 --> 05:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
Reserve um as has been mentioned there
 
05:49:36.830 --> 05:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
have been four Charters approved Speedy
 
05:49:39.788 --> 05:49:39.798 align:start position:0%
charters in Wyoming and their law allows
 
05:49:42.070 --> 05:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
that um but the Kansas City fed has yet
 
05:49:44.070 --> 05:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
to respond to those
 
05:49:46.190 --> 05:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
applications um and I believe actually
 
05:49:47.948 --> 05:49:47.958 align:start position:0%
chairman Powell commented on this just
 
05:49:49.390 --> 05:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday before the Senate Banking
 
05:49:52.270 --> 05:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
Committee um about regarding questions
 
05:49:55.510 --> 05:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
on Where the FED is on granting access
 
05:49:57.230 --> 05:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
um they've said that it's is going to be
 
05:49:59.430 --> 05:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
coming soon they issued a notice of
 
05:50:01.830 --> 05:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
proposed rulemaking a year ago um and I
 
05:50:03.430 --> 05:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
think their goal is to really create
 
05:50:05.708 --> 05:50:05.718 align:start position:0%
uniform standards in terms of how that
 
05:50:08.628 --> 05:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
access is granted um and the purpose is
 
05:50:10.590 --> 05:50:10.600 align:start position:0%
to create a consistent and transparent
 
05:50:12.310 --> 05:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
approach to be used by all the reserve
 
05:50:14.948 --> 05:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
banks um they don't have final rules out
 
05:50:16.750 --> 05:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
yet is my
 
05:50:19.070 --> 05:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
understanding um just we do want to
 
05:50:21.190 --> 05:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
point out there's a lot of U movement
 
05:50:23.510 --> 05:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
here on the federal level uh last
 
05:50:27.948 --> 05:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
November the fed the FDIC and the OCC
 
05:50:29.670 --> 05:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
they issued ued a joint statement on
 
05:50:31.868 --> 05:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
crypto asset policy Sprint initiative
 
05:50:33.948 --> 05:50:33.958 align:start position:0%
and the next steps and their whole goal
 
05:50:36.110 --> 05:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
was to address the rapidly evolving
 
05:50:39.628 --> 05:50:39.638 align:start position:0%
technology and they plan to look at how
 
05:50:41.868 --> 05:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
Banks can safely offer and expand their
 
05:50:41.878 --> 05:50:43.270 align:start position:0%
Banks can safely offer and expand their
crypto

05:50:43.270 --> 05:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
crypto
 
05:50:46.110 --> 05:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
offerings um in their review you know
 
05:50:48.190 --> 05:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
they put time and resources into looking
 
05:50:49.750 --> 05:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
at these issues and their initial
 
05:50:51.110 --> 05:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
conclusion was that they needed more
 
05:50:54.190 --> 05:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
time um they've outlined their work and
 
05:50:56.510 --> 05:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
what it's expected to cover in 2022 and
 
05:50:57.868 --> 05:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
we've included that for you all to take
 
05:51:00.670 --> 05:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:03.628 --> 05:51:03.638 align:start position:0%
um so just kind of the the last point
 
05:51:06.868 --> 05:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
that we want to um raise with you all is
 
05:51:09.070 --> 05:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
um the unlevel playing field I think
 
05:51:11.430 --> 05:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
there's a concern that you know we have
 
05:51:12.750 --> 05:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
banks that continue to move in New
 
05:51:15.070 --> 05:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that speaks well about New
 
05:51:17.350 --> 05:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy and you know our
 
05:51:19.190 --> 05:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
banks are very used to competition they
 
05:51:22.468 --> 05:51:22.478 align:start position:0%
don't shy away from that um and our
 
05:51:24.830 --> 05:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
members are are good corporate citizens
 
05:51:26.150 --> 05:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
and they take their commitment to
 
05:51:27.628 --> 05:51:27.638 align:start position:0%
supporting their communities and the
 
05:51:30.510 --> 05:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofit seriously um you all have
 
05:51:31.990 --> 05:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
probably heard from us before in other
 
05:51:33.590 --> 05:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that the regulatory
 
05:51:35.310 --> 05:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
challenges and the burdens on Community
 
05:51:37.708 --> 05:51:37.718 align:start position:0%
Banks um has definitely contributed to
 
05:51:39.830 --> 05:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
the increased trend of mergers and
 
05:51:42.948 --> 05:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions and along with fewer Banks
 
05:51:45.628 --> 05:51:45.638 align:start position:0%
being created so um this type of Charter
 
05:51:47.150 --> 05:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
We Believe would result in tipping the
 
05:51:49.270 --> 05:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
scales against Community Banks and would
 
05:51:50.868 --> 05:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
create an unlevel playing
 
05:51:53.190 --> 05:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
field um we don't believe that
 
05:51:54.708 --> 05:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency is going away anytime
 
05:51:56.310 --> 05:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
soon and the digitization of
 
05:51:58.670 --> 05:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
transactions will only continue to rise
 
05:52:01.070 --> 05:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
including in banking um and our banks
 
05:52:02.868 --> 05:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
are working to make progress in the
 
05:52:04.590 --> 05:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
space and meet the demands of their
 
05:52:07.070 --> 05:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
customers as they continue to evolve um
 
05:52:08.150 --> 05:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
but we don't believe this is the way to
 
05:52:10.750 --> 05:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
move it forward so for all these reasons
 
05:52:13.670 --> 05:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
we're in opposition and we would um ask
 
05:52:15.468 --> 05:52:15.478 align:start position:0%
for an expedient to legislate and we're
 
05:52:21.990 --> 05:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:24.750 --> 05:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
questions questions
 
05:52:28.868 --> 05:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
so I'm a little confused um it it
 
05:52:32.150 --> 05:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
sounded like this is something the banks
 
05:52:33.510 --> 05:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
that exist in New Hampshire already
 
05:52:35.190 --> 05:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
might want to
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
do so rather than creating a new
 
05:52:42.270 --> 05:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
division shouldn't we be working towards
 
05:52:44.670 --> 05:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
allowing our New Hampshire Banks the
 
05:52:47.868 --> 05:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
people who are already in the state to
 
05:52:50.708 --> 05:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
do this um chairman hun I think we would
 
05:52:52.510 --> 05:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
agree that that's certainly um
 
05:52:55.628 --> 05:52:55.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:58.750 --> 05:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
it okay well
 
05:53:02.350 --> 05:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:07.430 --> 05:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:07.440 --> 05:53:09.070 align:start position:0%
 
committee

05:53:09.070 --> 05:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:53:15.070 --> 05:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
right uh I guess we're all set thank
 
05:53:17.868 --> 05:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
you uh let's see so do I have the right
 
05:53:21.070 --> 05:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
build now what's my blue sheets blue
 
05:53:24.510 --> 05:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
sheets blue sheets what I do blue sheet
 
05:53:26.350 --> 05:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
I thought I thought I had them
 
05:53:33.670 --> 05:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:35.468 --> 05:53:35.478 align:start position:0%
uh that's
 
05:53:39.110 --> 05:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
it all right um we're just waiting for
 
05:53:42.830 --> 05:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet that's not it
 
05:53:46.948 --> 05:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
I maybe I got it here there I think it
 
05:53:51.670 --> 05:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
got lost in the pile here 1504 all
 
05:53:56.110 --> 05:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
right so we had uh one One support and
 
05:54:00.150 --> 05:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
34 uh posed to to the bill
 
05:54:03.070 --> 05:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
electronically and then uh pretty much
 
05:54:05.750 --> 05:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
the same uh Suzanne Smith representa
 
05:54:08.110 --> 05:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
Smith is opposed representative
 
05:54:10.708 --> 05:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
Alexander and representative Warden are
 
05:54:13.270 --> 05:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
in support and Lisa tap is also in
 
05:54:15.948 --> 05:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
support and with that I will close the
 
05:54:15.958 --> 05:54:16.750 align:start position:0%
support and with that I will close the
public

05:54:16.750 --> 05:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:54:19.548 --> 05:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
hearing um I have
 
05:54:22.390 --> 05:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
scheduled the subcommittee uh for this
 
05:54:26.510 --> 05:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
bill it will be on Wednesday the
 
05:54:29.270 --> 05:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
26th and I think think it's going to be
 
05:54:29.280 --> 05:54:30.948 align:start position:0%
26th and I think think it's going to be
