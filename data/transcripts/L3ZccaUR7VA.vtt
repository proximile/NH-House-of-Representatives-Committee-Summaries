00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open the work session uh
 
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
anybody watching the work session for
 
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
public employees Labor Relations Board
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
has had to be rescheduled
 
00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 align:start position:0%
to March 8th at 11 A.M so what we're
 
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
going to do today is just start going
 
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
through House Bill 2 maybe we can tick
 
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
off a few little things and plba has
 
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
presented us with a breakdown of all
 
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
Melissa and Mr Hoffman if is anything
 
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
that you think we should hit right off
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
the bat or do we should just start with
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
the first one number one the department
 
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
of Information Technology
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
makes sense to start at the top and work
 
00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.490 align:start position:0%
makes sense to start at the top and work
through

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
example number one I think we heard from
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner Goulet that that is
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
a change
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
to make the statute align with the way
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
no problem no no problem with this one
 
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
number two is a continuation of the
 
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 align:start position:0%
ability for
 
00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
doat to fill unfunded positions
 
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
so they use the Appropriations that are
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
are given to them
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
and they have that flexibility as long
 
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
as they don't exceed those
 
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.170 align:start position:0%
as they don't exceed those
Appropriations

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
I representative everybody okay with
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
that as well Dan well I have a question
 
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
which is I mean if if some of their
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
money like it was given to them by dot
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
or something can they go fill a position
 
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
for safety you know what I mean is it
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
this seems a little weird yeah
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
they would have had the
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
Authority with this to make the
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate accounting adjustments so
 
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
they're not charging
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
transportation for a safety position
 
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.930 align:start position:0%
transportation for a safety position
okay

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
so they have this because to me this
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
makes it look like they can just take
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
all their salary make one big blob and
 
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
and hire
 
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
whoever they want with it no
 
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
no all of their budget is other funds
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
right so everything they do is paid for
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
by other agencies to their shared costs
 
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
they distribute across the whole state
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
event costs are specific to that agency
 
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
and they charge that Agency for those
 
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.230 align:start position:0%
and they charge that Agency for those
costs

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know representative McGuire actually
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
so number two is
 
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
that was the employee incentive program
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
I think we discussed right Mr Hoffman
 
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
yes the
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
liquor commissioner um
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
described that when he was in with the
 
00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:11.830 align:start position:0%
described that when he was in with the
division

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
in relation to their struggle to find
 
00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:17.930 align:start position:0%
in relation to their struggle to find
people

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
given the salaries they can offer this
 
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt do you have a
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
house bill too or I
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
my house bill too is oh oh okay well
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
there's another you can get there's one
 
00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
it might might come up with some good
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
so we okay with 12. yeah for sure so
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
what are the dollar amounts associated
 
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
yeah liquor when they gave us their
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
presentation there was a dollar amount
 
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
again it's their funds no General funds
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
but yeah
 
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
so it's in other words it'd be other
 
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.630 align:start position:0%
so it's in other words it'd be other
funds

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
that would be a good idea
 
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
I think most of these divisions need to
 
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
set up programs
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
Mike do you have a dollar amount by
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
Melissa's pulling up their presentation
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
right now that was the one happens so
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
oh no apology necessary so
 
00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:48.650 align:start position:0%
oh no apology necessary so
okay

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
we get whatever they don't spend you
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
know I think it was about so the more
 
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
might be included because I think they
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
made the argument representative Griffin
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
when they were here that if they didn't
 
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
do this they couldn't keep some of their
 
00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
liquor stores open or fully staffed and
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
I think representative Hewitt just
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
picked up
 
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
thanks Janet
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
what they said was it was a team
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
approach and as opposed to increasing
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
salaries one of the things they thought
 
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
so we okay with 12 Jerry
 
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm fine
 
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest on 13 and 14 that we
 
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
wait because Corrections is coming in
 
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.050 align:start position:0%
wait because Corrections is coming in
tomorrow

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
it was my thought that when these folks
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
come in to see us as we've done uh in
 
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
the past those of you have been here
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
like representative Griffin is when the
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
Departments present their budget they
 
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
talk speak to the house bill 2 impacts
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
that have been listed so everybody okay
 
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
with waiting on the 13 and 14.
 
00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:14.339 align:start position:0%
and 15. and 15 and 16. yeah 15 and 16.
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
and then we go to 17.
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
yes yeah Des is coming in to see us
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
and that's uh 18.
 
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
as well I'm looking at my
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I went through and highlighted
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
everything here let's see 18
 
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
I believe these Environmental Services
 
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
sections go up into the second page
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
section 39 on page 16.
 
00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.870 align:start position:0%
section 39 on page 16.
in

00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
I did speak with Susan Carlson of
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and they're going
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
to be prepared to talk about
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
the house bill two sections for their
 
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.090 align:start position:0%
the house bill two sections for their
Department

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
so just we're skipping over 19 again
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
that was the Department of Justice
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.220 align:start position:0%
it looks very minor
 
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
you want to get rid of 19 representative
 
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
yeah McGuire it's adding five words or
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
at the top of page nine it's on yeah
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
qualified applicants to service hearing
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
officers that I mean it seems pretty
 
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:52.700 align:start position:0%
well 19 starts
 
00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman 29 oh you said 21
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
yeah 21-0 the 21s are all the statutes
 
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
that govern the various departments
 
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.629 align:start position:0%
that govern the various departments
um

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
I mean I I can answer it in a way so at
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
DES there's the waste management Council
 
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
there's the water Council there's the
 
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
air Council and what this is saying is
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General already has
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
some appointment appointment power to
 
00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
those councils and I think it's
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
expanding it to include clerical and
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
support Personnel yeah I think
 
00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
that's what all that is about
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
lesson all right representative evils
 
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
suggesting we bless it another
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire say why not yeah
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
sure yeah I see agreement there yeah but
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
I jump on that while we can so 19 we're
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
all set with Mr Hoffman Melissa
 
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:11.579 align:start position:0%
all right so now there's a bunch of
 
00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:14.090 align:start position:0%
all right so now there's a bunch of
Environmental

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
Environmental
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
and Mike you said that they're prepared
 
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:26.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
so we're already I'm up to page 15.
 
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.329 align:start position:0%
so we're already I'm up to page 15.

00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
16.
 
00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:34.610 align:start position:0%
16.
it's

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
it's office of regulatory review

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
yeah Melissa Mr Hoffman can you help us
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.910 align:start position:0%

um

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:17.220 align:start position:0%
I guess a watchdog kind of agency that
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
keeps an eye on administrative rules on
 
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:21.300 align:start position:0%

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
looks like it's part of the Bea
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at page 18 my number
 
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
one section 41.
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
and the appropriation
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
looks like it's 1.5 million
 
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
two years is that right
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
see page 18 number four you know
 
00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:50.339 align:start position:0%
appropriation office of regulatory
 
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:55.019 align:start position:0%
review ah yes the sum of 750
 
00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:57.730 align:start position:0%
review ah yes the sum of 750
000

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
twice twice so it's 1.5 million
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
all right so maybe we should hold on to
 
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
this in case we need to find it yes we
 
00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:12.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
Melissa also pointed out on that it may
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
need an amendment
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
because RSA 12p is the Department of
 
00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
energy oh it's a small Point she she has
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard any testimony or
 
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
Melissa is this on the big list of House
 
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 appropriation
 
00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:50.459 align:start position:0%
yeah it would be a general fund
 
00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:54.769 align:start position:0%
yeah it would be a general fund
appropriation

00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
you're looking for what this one that
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
so we'll hear from um
 
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
them I think next week as far as a

I think they're in Wednesday Wednesday
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
okay this Wednesday
 
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.789 align:start position:0%
okay this Wednesday
should

00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
I want to just take home and stuff we'll
 
00:17:53.049 --> 00:17:53.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna go to oh you got it yeah
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
yes it is Wednesday
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
page 18 historic housing preservation
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's uh a new section uh
 
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.169 align:start position:0%
that's uh a new section uh
where

00:18:15.169 --> 00:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
the development of residential property
 
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
not single family
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
provides a
 
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:31.669 align:start position:0%
there is
um

00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
there's a cap on the amount of five
 
00:18:36.529 --> 00:18:36.539 align:start position:0%
million dollars in any fiscal year
 
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
and there's also similar language in a
 
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
to me this seems like something
 
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.730 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:09.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.130 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
but this this is a credit so it's not
 
00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
just a deduction so it could cost us
 
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
five million a year here so this is a
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
or just say no and let them find a
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
legislature to put it to put it in next
 
00:19:59.330 --> 00:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
I can tell you this is modeled after the
 
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
cdfa credit very similar parameters as
 
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.590 align:start position:0%
cdfa credit very similar parameters as
cdfa

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
cdfa
 
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
the requirements are a little bit
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
different but the way the tax credit is
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
basically word for word as cdfa tax
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
credit and what is cefa
 
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.669 align:start position:0%
credit and what is cefa
Community

00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
Community
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
um development housing or Community
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.010 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's important
 
00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start position:0%
as at a minimum right either say no or
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:08.690 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
like Mike Hoffman said there's a similar
 
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
bill being heard in this in Senate
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
Finance right now with very similar
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
languages so there's been a lot of talk
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
and discussion on there too if you
 
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
wanted some more information we could
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
get you the committee report on that so
 
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
you could have a read through of what
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
was discussed on that if you'd like
 
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
have they made a determination or no
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
they're still talking um I think maybe
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we'll come up to vote on it
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
who's the Prime sponsor that
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
does it have a fiscal note
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
it does
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
10 million
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
um it's broken out because there's other
 
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
Appropriations involved in it but it's
 
00:21:57.409 --> 00:21:57.419 align:start position:0%
it's less because it's 65 percent of the
 
00:22:00.409 --> 00:22:00.419 align:start position:0%
five five million dollars so the
 
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
donation or the credit that's being made
 
00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:06.419 align:start position:0%
is 65 of 5 million of the cap and then
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
that can be carried forward so I think
 
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
the first year is that that 65 of the 5
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
million and after that it's
 
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
indeterminable because there can be a
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
carry forward of that credit if not used
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
against the BET BBT or insurance premium
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.409 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:27.419 align:start position:0%

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
okay so let's let's
 
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.350 align:start position:0%
okay so let's let's
um

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
get the data from Senator Ennis and ask
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
ways and means if they think they're
 
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
likely to want to pass this bill in the
 
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:30.419 align:start position:0%
first fiscal year it's 3.25 million and
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
then an indeterminable increase in the
 
00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:33.539 align:start position:0%
Years After
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.280 align:start position:0%

what's the number of the percent of bill
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:18.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you all right invest in h program
 
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.700 --> 00:25:03.409 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:03.409 --> 00:25:03.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:06.970 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:06.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so this is um there's another
 
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
big box item
 
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:21.169 align:start position:0%
big box item
30.

00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
all right so I think you probably want
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
to hold on to this one this again is
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
also in that same SB 231 that I just
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
spoke about as well that the Senate's
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
right but this is just a straight
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
expenditure right
 
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
make grants and loans for the purpose of
 
00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.230 align:start position:0%
make grants and loans for the purpose of
accelerating

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
accelerating
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
no I think it's just spending
 
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:22.490 align:start position:0%
no I think it's just spending
yeah

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:41.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
right and
 
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.450 align:start position:0%
right and
accelerated

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:49.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
this will be within Bea so we could ask
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
them to speak about this on Wednesday as
 
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
well if you'd like
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
yeah let's do that and and I object in
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
the maximum Grant is so much right it's
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
it lets it it lets the department decide
 
00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
but maybe this is one of those things
 
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
they've already been doing for 10 years
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
and some other guys and they're going to
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know just continue it under this
 
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
name or something like that right so
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
okay so which department are we talking
 
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.870 align:start position:0%
okay so which department are we talking
about

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.370 align:start position:0%
about
back

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
business and economic Affairs okay in
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
the coming Wednesday this may be related
 
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
to some things they've done with the uh
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
our money that the state received it
 
00:27:50.169 --> 00:27:50.179 align:start position:0%
extends extends it using general funds
 
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
I'll let you
 
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
go right along okay sure so we're on um
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
there's 30 million for
 
00:27:59.159 --> 00:27:59.750 align:start position:0%
there's 30 million for
um

00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
for housing this invest NIH program so
 
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
yeah and notice it's 2023
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
right so this is leftover money from
 
00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:48.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
so this is money that otherwise would go
 
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:59.810 --> 00:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
section four okay so so these are all
 
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
three together yeah effective date
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
for some reason you wrote them as
 
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.769 align:start position:0%
for some reason you wrote them as
separate

00:29:20.769 --> 00:29:20.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
John is going to the Housing Finance
 
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.769 align:start position:0%
John is going to the Housing Finance
Authority

00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
so the index uses the section numbers in
 
00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
oh I see
 
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.510 align:start position:0%
oh I see
so

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.649 align:start position:0%
so
and

00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of years when
 
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
drafting House Bill 2 instead of having
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
all the effective dates piled up at the
 
00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
end of the bill which was very confusing
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
OS has tried to where they can put the
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
effective dates with the section
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
I see so you can see when that section
 
00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:57.059 align:start position:0%
is effective without flipping back and
 
00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
forth all right so the next thing we're
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
going to consider is sections 47 and 48.
 
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
yes yes so that's another 25. and uh
 
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
Ben Frost of the New Hampshire Housing
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
Finance has has been invited sometime
 
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
Friday he'll be here to discuss that
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
okay it's not scheduled yet she was just
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
on the phone trying to give oh was he he
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
sent an email saying he he's available
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
to come Friday just tell us tell him
 
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.070 align:start position:0%
to come Friday just tell us tell him
when

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
because there's somewhat of an
 
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
overlapping purpose between this 25 and
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
interesting to hear why they decided to
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
and not to be redundant but this is also
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
in that same Senate bill so they'll have
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
some in the committee report they'll
 
00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
does the Senate Bill prevent somebody
 
00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.330 align:start position:0%
does the Senate Bill prevent somebody
from

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:19.340 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
applying for both sets of funds for the
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
so we'll get 65 percent here and another
 
00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:33.220 align:start position:0%
65 percent there and we're happy
 
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:38.210 align:start position:0%
65 percent there and we're happy
[Laughter]

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.610 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
okay

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.100 align:start position:0%
all right Bridges House special account
 
00:31:59.510 --> 00:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
I don't think that
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
that appropriated money I think that was
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
just a place to
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
donate yeah richest houses oh Mom no
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
money right
 
00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:18.539 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman we sure there's no money here
 
00:32:21.769 --> 00:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
there's no appropriation for that
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
so we should be okay with that I think I
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
feel fine about that an empty money
 
00:32:28.919 --> 00:32:30.769 align:start position:0%
feel fine about that an empty money
okay

00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
so that's uh 66 and 67.
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
and now Corrections again so we're going
 
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
oh this is to buy the building for the
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
yeah we have the Department of Justice
 
00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
coming in tomorrow at 9 30. okay
 
00:33:06.659 --> 00:33:08.269 align:start position:0%
coming in tomorrow at 9 30. okay
Gucci

00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
Gucci
 
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
wait where are you
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
page 31 right section 75 yeah
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
question there I mean that involves Das
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
too because are we leasing that place
 
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
this was one
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh Melissa Mr Hoffman did you get a hold
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
of someone from Das to come as well
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
I mean it's all involved with everything
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's going on with the parking garage
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
question Mr Hoffman or Melissa how do we
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
find out what arpa funds we can use
 
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
seems very fluid
 
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell will be here and
 
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
he's also the
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
the person in charge of the Gopher
 
00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:18.730 align:start position:0%
the person in charge of the Gopher
organization

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:18.740 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
that administered the federal funds
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
so that would be a good question for
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
them and there's also
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
some spending information on their
 
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.490 align:start position:0%
some spending information on their
website

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
um we have a she where we track what's
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
come in through fiscal but as far as
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
allowable uses he would probably be one
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
of the better people to ask
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
you might warn them we're going to ask
 
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
him I mean I I'd like to understand the
 
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
procedure too
 
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
carry on sir
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
okay next is the parking garage and
 
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
here's that's that's
 
00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:08.099 align:start position:0%
um section 79 toward the bottom of page
 
00:35:08.099 --> 00:35:09.650 align:start position:0%
um section 79 toward the bottom of page
31.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
31.
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
and and unfortunately our house bill has
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
25 million not 15 and I was I asked dais
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
and they said 25 is correct so therefore
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
this 15 needs to be increased to 25.
 
00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:30.349 align:start position:0%
this 15 needs to be increased to 25.
no

00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
either way because the bill is going to
 
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
come up either next week or the week
 
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
after in full committee okay so do you
 
00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:38.579 align:start position:0%
want to just
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman Melissa we can just remove
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
this since we've got a separate house
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
bill is that correct
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
you could you could remove it
 
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.470 align:start position:0%
you could you could remove it
um

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
add the house bill language to the
 
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill if you want it all in one
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
place it's whatever you decide
 
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire since you were in
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
the minority on that and you have a
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
preference I want to be fair
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
well yeah I mean I think the what makes
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
sense is to edit this paragraph to have
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
the 25 and if there's any other language
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
from the house bill
 
00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
there's a lot in the house bill was this
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
I thought it was sort of a short well no
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
well I mean I'm
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
well this would be the proper place for
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
it I think well if it passes it will go
 
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
to the floor and go to the Senate
 
00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of a rush to get going
 
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.530 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of a rush to get going
yeah

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
oh because this is 2023 yeah you'd
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
rather just pass it as a bill yeah since
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
it came out as a bill I know that's a
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
preference of the speaker okay
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
um and just on our list
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
mentally subtract 25 million from 2023.
 
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
yeah Melissa and Mr Hoffman will make a
 
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
note that with the house bill
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation okay that's fine yeah so
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:19.320 align:start position:0%

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
line

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
um 17.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
all it all it's doing is adding one
 
00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:41.579 align:start position:0%
sentence that one member of the board of
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals shall be an
 
00:39:43.079 --> 00:39:47.410 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals shall be an
attorney

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:47.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm looking at their budget
 
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.870 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm looking at their budget
separately

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
separately
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
yeah see we had them in here on the 16th
 
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
for their budget presentation
 
00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339 align:start position:0%
I think we're okay with their
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
budget at the time yeah
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
did did that budget anticipate this
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
change that's in HP hb2 I think actually
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
one of the Commissioners is a lawyer
 
00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
isn't that correct Mr Hoffman yes it
 
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't add a new position it just says
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
one of the members shall be an attorney
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
they did have a request to make an
 
00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
adjustment for their doat costs and we
 
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
have that on a sheet of additional
 
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:31.310 align:start position:0%
have that on a sheet of additional
requests

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
so are you okay with them
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
requiring the attorney because again I
 
00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:38.339 align:start position:0%
think at least one of them is an
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I was inclined in general to give
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
them what
 
00:40:53.569 --> 00:40:53.579 align:start position:0%
the resources they want because they
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
seem quite efficient and heavily used
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
right so we're considering raising their
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
65 fee to I don't know a hundred dollars
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
or something else yeah I'm fine with it
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:41:11.089 --> 00:41:11.099 align:start position:0%
all right next one repeal the
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means took that out didn't they
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
um that's true yes in there well
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it's
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
they listed it right but on the other
 
00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:31.550 align:start position:0%
they listed it right but on the other
hand

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
they just went by existing law right so
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
it's I don't I'm not sure that they
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
really make a decision to keep it or did
 
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.089 align:start position:0%
really make a decision to keep it or did
they

00:41:41.089 --> 00:41:41.099 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:43.190 align:start position:0%
they
um

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
yeah just give us 17. I think house
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
resolution 17 gives us you know if we
 
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
don't change any laws here's what you're
 
00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.089 --> 00:41:58.099 align:start position:0%
so the pleasure of our group
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
yeah they have it here
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
um I'm not excited about repealing it
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
when I look at all the other how much
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
money was that it's 30 million 30
 
00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.170 align:start position:0%
money was that it's 30 million 30
million

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of dough it just leave that
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
alone for the time being yeah
 
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579 align:start position:0%
um someone made a com comment to me that
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
if there are no tax cuts we lose 100
 
00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:31.220 align:start position:0%
that wasn't me and uh so if that's true
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
this is the the smallest possible tax
 
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:36.150 align:start position:0%
cut there is right so
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:40.849 align:start position:0%
cut there is right so
[Laughter]

00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
so I don't know I
 
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
think this is a matter for the whole
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
committee and something else right it's
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a substantial it's a
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
substantial amount it's 56 million for
 
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
the for the biennials and there's a lot
 
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
more to it than fixing a telephone
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
so we'll put that on hold as far as
 
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
bring it up before the full committee
 
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.210 align:start position:0%
bring it up before the full committee
yeah

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
or when we get closer to the wire
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
department of revenue is coming in on
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
Wednesday at 10 so these Department of
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
Revenue things are quite a few of them
 
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
here we can
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
these two way down through 108 109.
 
00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.670 align:start position:0%
these two way down through 108 109.
so

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
those enhanced 9-1-1 is that Revenue so
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
that's that takes care of sections 101
 
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
just changing the statute story
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
references or fixing them yes
 
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
well like some of them I see they've
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
deleted a reference to the communication
 
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
Services test so it would depend so it's
 
00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:50.339 align:start position:0%
related yeah some of it I mean I'm
 
00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:53.540 align:start position:0%
looking at 10 section 106
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
107 is public utilities
 
00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.150 align:start position:0%
107 is public utilities
yeah

00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
so that reminds me of Representative
 
00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.650 align:start position:0%
so that reminds me of Representative
McGuire

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
I had fiscal that Friday that you
 
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.190 align:start position:0%
I had fiscal that Friday that you
handled

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
handled
 
00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.569 align:start position:0%
handled
uh

00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and the
 
00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:16.220 align:start position:0%
Community Development Finance Authority
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
did you guys find those okay that was on
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
any recollection Melissa or Mike on the
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
17th when the department of energy and
 
00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
the three attached boards and
 
00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:40.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
any need for them to come back or
 
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.630 align:start position:0%
any need for them to come back or
um

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think so unless
 
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.430 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think so unless
um

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
I don't think we've decided to have them
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
come back but we didn't dream of making
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
a decision without him oh yeah that's
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
why I lead representative there's one
 
00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:03.020 align:start position:0%
related bill which is House Bill 234
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.190 align:start position:0%
right and so
um

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams bill yeah
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
and that came out without recommendation
 
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
I think you're right yeah so
 
00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:23.339 align:start position:0%
a lot of this like the 911 I'm looking
 
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
at this redefining communication
 
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.950 align:start position:0%
at this redefining communication
services

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
so it's related to the tax repeal I
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
yes all the way through Section 110 has
 
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
to do with that Communications tax yeah
 
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:44.099 align:start position:0%
we can ask the commissioner when she's
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
here on Wednesday to maybe go over some
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
of this it's pretty confident right
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
I do believe Ways and Means has a bill
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
right to repeal this tax okay and I
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if they've acted on It or Not
 
00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
by the energy here
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
anything on that Mike a Melissa that
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
weighs the means a bill to repeal
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of that but we can follow
 
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
up we'll I'll check with uh
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
Chris too on what the resolution does
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
because sometimes they show current law
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:26.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
so we have one that 110
 
00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
which is emergency waiver out-of-state
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
business employees Communications sir
 
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.530 align:start position:0%
business employees Communications sir
okay

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
that's where it talks about
 
00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
communication services
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're correct for house ways and means
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
they do have a repeal CST bill it goes
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
to Executive session on March 8th so in
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
a couple of days okay thanks Melissa and
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
all right so we should wait for that
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
also on our tracking sheet we don't have
 
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
any additional requests for the
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.870 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
okay

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
so are we good with the Department of
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
energy checking them off so the LBA has
 
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
another check mark
 
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.569 align:start position:0%
another check mark
anybody

00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
yes I guess
 
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.970 align:start position:0%
yes I guess
representative

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
well he just made a reference of the
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
Department of energy that was here back
 
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:33.560 align:start position:0%
on February uh
 
00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.270 align:start position:0%
on February uh
17.

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
17.
 
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
you remember the day we saw Department
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about that we're just
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the regular budget
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
the big budget
 
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:50.300 align:start position:0%
those particular sections
 
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative Leachman wants to know
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
can we sort of pass those or or do we
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
want to revisit I mean I just don't
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
remember them well enough I don't
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
remember thinking I had a problem but
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
we should at least take a glance we'll
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
all right so I think now we jump to what
 
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
a back to house bill 2. I want to oh go
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
ahead I do seem to recall there was one
 
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
guy who said he was new and he hadn't
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
had any work yet or something right he
 
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
was he was given some tasks and like
 
00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:29.339 align:start position:0%
nobody had applied for that thing
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
whatever it was
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
do you remember that guy no that was the
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh site evaluation committee oh that's
 
00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:39.740 align:start position:0%
right yeah and uh you had asked him for
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh the cost of the permits for something
 
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:45.020 align:start position:0%
at uh Seabrook
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
and I have a voicemail
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
from him that I haven't deciphered yet
 
00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:51.770 align:start position:0%
from him that I haven't deciphered yet
um

00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
because he was talking about 1991
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
dollars converted to current dollars so
 
00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know how relevant it is I gotta
 
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
listen to it again
 
00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
but in general he seemed very underused
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
right I mean he
 
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.210 align:start position:0%
right I mean he
right

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:11.579 align:start position:0%
he he he fielded these requests and
 
00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
there was hardly any of them right so
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
the uh the structure is there for when a
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
utility wants to build something yeah
 
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
but there's not there are times when
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of activity right he
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
said there was nothing pending right
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
right exactly but in those site yeah
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
applications that's where Northern Pass
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
was right so they had plenty to do for a
 
00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.089 align:start position:0%
was right so they had plenty to do for a
while

00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
his little section yeah yeah yeah he had
 
00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
somebody that was the
 
00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
but it well anyways it was an idea for
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
if you absolutely needed to cut
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
something there might be some room there
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay well wait Mike and see what you can
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
decipher and get that back to represent
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
so we have button 112 labor 111.
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
so 111 through 118 all have to do with
 
00:50:14.829 --> 00:50:14.839 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor some of those
 
00:50:20.089 --> 00:50:20.099 align:start position:0%
are changes in response to an LBA audit
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
had to do with where they deposit the
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
fees they collect
 
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
so a lot of it is clean up but the
 
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor will be in here
 
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I believe
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
the other department of labor yet
 
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.010 align:start position:0%
the other department of labor yet
tomorrow

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
at 11 A.M okay
 
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
yeah instead of putting things in
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
general funds they're putting it in some
 
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:03.410 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
penalty appeals or
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
so they they can talk to us about the
 
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
Family and Medical Leave Insurance labor
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.049 --> 00:51:33.059 align:start position:0%
so this one the attorney received
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
400 per diem
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
okay check with the guy on the end there
 
00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:45.770 align:start position:0%
okay check with the guy on the end there
yeah

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.329 --> 00:51:47.339 align:start position:0%
see the attorney member of the board
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
page 40. yeah
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:03.490 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a bargain right
 
00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:05.470 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a bargain right
[Laughter]

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:12.549 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
so

00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.609 --> 00:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.619 --> 00:52:17.470 align:start position:0%
 
compliance

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
all right so we're gonna ask these guys
 
00:52:22.609 --> 00:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
tomorrow yeah tomorrow yeah so that'd be
 
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but again they'll be here at
 
00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:25.910 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but again they'll be here at
11.

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
11.
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
okay family medical leave 116. that
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
should be with them as well
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
but then going to 117 boiler and
 
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
I know I'm sorry so then we skip all the
 
00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:00.140 align:start position:0%
way to 131 I believe abandoned property
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
yeah there's some weird stuff that's
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
part of I guess labor which is this
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
boiler inspections I think maybe
 
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
elevator inspections are also in labor
 
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
right if you go into an elevator and
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
look at who signs it's like the
 
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Labor right so he goes
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
and inspects us well somebody works here
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
but my point is there's a few things
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
like that that are just kind of randomly
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
scattered around anyway
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay so I think we jump all the way to
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
131 my
 
00:53:33.609 --> 00:53:33.619 align:start position:0%
highlight is correct
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
so unclaimed and abandoned property that
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
was with the treasury
 
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
so we can check that off Mr Hoffman
 
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.190 align:start position:0%
so we can check that off Mr Hoffman
Melissa

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
Melissa
 
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
now revenue is sharing we always suspend
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
Mike remind us what is it like 25
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
million a years or something like that
 
00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:09.980 align:start position:0%
and I think it's been since 2010 2011
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
that it's been suspended
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's been out yeah ever since uh yeah
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
about 2000 during the big crash I think
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
give you a big explanation oh yeah
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
representative evil wants to add it back
 
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
in no suspension and
 
00:54:41.809 --> 00:54:41.819 align:start position:0%
Jerry wants to give a little more to
 
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
want Vernon
 
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:46.300 align:start position:0%
oh Tony needs some more too
 
00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.530 align:start position:0%
oh Tony needs some more too
[Laughter]

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:54:53.329 --> 00:54:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
it's again it's it's weird that it's
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
here because we always suspend but
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
well I guess you have to do it by
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
Statute right right to do it I mean by
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
the way if we don't suspend it we do it
 
00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:10.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
you and I agree
 
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
this gentleman we shouldn't be too
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
absolute here but this gentleman I have
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
always agreed the rainy day final the
 
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
big Surplus all that money is really
 
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:29.220 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money it really should go back
 
00:55:31.609 --> 00:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
we've always agreed on that one pretzel
 
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
but okay so we can sit on it we can
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
could you Mike and Melissa get us the
 
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
actual the hard numbers because I
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
remember it's like about 25 million a
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
year but see what it works out to as far
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
as this bike you know because it goes
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
there's an escalator built into it this
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
isn't rooms of meals or is it no it's
 
00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
something separating for me it's just a
 
00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
payment from the general fund direct to
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
the yeah but there's a formula buy a
 
00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
formula yeah okay
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
yeah depending how much is in there as
 
00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
we know yeah
 
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
that would be at least a 50 million
 
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
dollar hit I think around
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
this isn't that funny is another 25
 
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:25.460 align:start position:0%
million years
 
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:28.460 align:start position:0%
everything you know
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
well and if you did want to share it
 
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be 25 even it's worth
 
00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:36.870 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:43.970 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:46.220 align:start position:0%
so like one
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
133 electric utility restructuring
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
I believe that's just some remaining
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
cleanup from when they created the
 
00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
department of energy two years ago yes I
 
00:57:11.089 --> 00:57:11.099 align:start position:0%
look at it that's what it looked like to
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
me except they
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.089 --> 00:57:19.099 align:start position:0%
because it
 
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
no it's um offshore wind is line 9 and
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
I would imagine there was a problem we
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
what do you guys think about one third
 
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
oh wait so 130 132 to 137 is okay
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
here London
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
previous of the commissioner
 
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:32.579 align:start position:0%
that's what it has been though right
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
that language yeah that's not a chance
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
but this is the fun representative
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
McWilliams wants more money in
 
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
I believe you're correct
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
yep but I think it looks like they're
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
just adding a reference to Offshore wind
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:06.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.839 --> 00:59:15.289 align:start position:0%
 
damn

00:59:15.289 --> 00:59:15.299 align:start position:0%
damn
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
so we're just working on some budget
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
stuff but just to give you an idea what
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking for any of your hb2
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
impacts I noticed like boxing they want
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
to move out of your neck of the woods
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
and some other things just to give you a
 
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
little repair
 
00:59:32.349 --> 00:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
so so are we agreed on 133 to 137 I
 
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
believe so all right everybody okay with
 
00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:41.089 align:start position:0%
believe so all right everybody okay with
that

00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
well it does require both the fiscal
 
00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.589 align:start position:0%
well it does require both the fiscal
committee

00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:17.230 align:start position:0%
so that's
amazing

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
it means they want to treat the
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy like the judicial
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
Council ah very good right so that they
 
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
run out of money
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
they're absolutely necessary therefore
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
they can come ask for more
 
01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
yeah Deanna and I have had a
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire an event this
 
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
conversation before I think the fiscal
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
committee has way too much power even
 
01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:43.700 align:start position:0%
though I've been there a long time
 
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
but it's true it basically usurps the
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislature do a lot of things when the
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
legislature's not in session we do a lot
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
of things so the original intent was was
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
laudable yeah because without it
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
but the state wouldn't spend any money
 
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
after the legislative
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
but so a number of different state
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
agencies as you know come to fiscal
 
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
whether it's Corrections or judicial
 
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
Council and we can or cannot approve
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
like traditional I mean Chris I think I
 
01:01:17.329 --> 01:01:17.339 align:start position:0%
don't like this okay personally I just
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
in general when people come to the
 
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee they want to move money
 
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
right they have it over here but they
 
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
need it over there so they shift because
 
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
this is saying funds we'll pour more in
 
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
that's almost a billion and a quarter
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
last year yeah it's a lot of money
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
so the way I explain fiscal to people is
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
the budget is a point in time
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
right the budget is our best guess for
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen over the next two
 
01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.230 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen over the next two
years

01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
and the fiscal committee is the
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
in-course correction
 
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
right things didn't go quite the way you
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
expected so the fiscal committee can
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
make changes so that you get to where
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
you want to go right so that that's the
 
01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.309 align:start position:0%
you want to go right so that that's the
idea

01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
um because we can't always predict
 
01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:22.849 align:start position:0%
um because we can't always predict
perfectly

01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
perfectly
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
what revenues coming in what you know
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
grants are going to come in all that
 
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff so you have to have
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
somebody who along the way can make a
 
01:02:31.559 --> 01:02:35.329 align:start position:0%
somebody who along the way can make a
change

01:02:35.329 --> 01:02:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.329 --> 01:02:43.339 align:start position:0%
dispensation by stats
 
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the authority
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
now certainly Corrections has it
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
judicial Council has it so is this a
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
standard Department of Health and Human
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
Services has it yeah so you're we'd be
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
giving another agency within state
 
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
government they could I don't want to I
 
01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say this but it's kind of true
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
if you're a little sloppy with your
 
01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
budget then you come and get it fixed or
 
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
is it it could be a problem you know
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
there could be a problem like over time
 
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
with corrections is a huge problem they
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
never have enough money
 
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
so thoughts on 138 Representatives
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
are they coming back no no not energy
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
unless you want them to come back Mr
 
01:03:24.119 --> 01:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
unless you want them to come back Mr
chair

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
just one difference here
 
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.849 align:start position:0%
just one difference here
um

01:03:28.849 --> 01:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
judicial Council comes in for General
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
funds this is a utility assessment right
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
and the department and the puc are
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.730 align:start position:0%
 
thoughts

01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
well since it's two o'clock we'll stop
 
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
at 1 38. Melissa Mr Hoffman and come
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
back to that
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
so it being
 
01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
two o'clock
 
01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
we have the Department of State I also
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
have the boxing and wrestling
 
01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:14.839 align:start position:0%
and I also had a note here the Ombudsman
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
they fall under your jurisdiction right
 
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
so maybe you can talk about that
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
position how it's working out but
 
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
so Mr secretary and Deputy are good to
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
see you and
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
yeah we you might you might as well come
 
01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
up you make all the decisions so you
 
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
but thanks for the record if you could
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
just identify yourselves thank you Mr
 
01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:44.099 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee I'm
 
01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
David Scanlon uh Secretary of State
 
01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'm Aaron Hennessey deputy secretary of
 
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.170 align:start position:0%
I'm Aaron Hennessey deputy secretary of
state

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.190 align:start position:0%
state
um

01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
just before we get into the hb2 items uh
 
01:04:58.370 --> 01:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
I'll say generally that
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
the proposed budget for our department
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
is an efficiency budget so we you know
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
complied with the governor's request and
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
we have created four new positions in
 
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
this budget
 
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
and there's one conversion from a
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary to a to a classified
 
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.650 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary to a to a classified
position

01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh the reason for the positions
 
01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
primarily are because of all the work
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
that we've been doing with our I.T
 
01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.289 align:start position:0%
that we've been doing with our I.T
systems

01:05:38.289 --> 01:05:38.299 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh updating our website uh getting our
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
databases in good order and functioning
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
properly and we've made a lot of Headway
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
uh in those areas and obviously we want
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
to maintain that so uh hopefully you've
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
been on our website and seen some of
 
01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
that activity but there have been some
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
major improvements there
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh there is one small request that I
 
01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
would like to make in the budget the
 
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:12.500 align:start position:0%
Canadian trade Council met this morning
 
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
in an organizational meeting and that
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
Council has had
 
01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:20.579 align:start position:0%
a budget line in our in our budget of
 
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
eight thousand dollars per year that
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
hasn't been changed probably at least
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
the last decade even though the council
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
has become a lot more active and so I'd
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
like to request uh changing that eight
 
01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh let's see what we don't have the same
 
01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
Pages yeah probably don't have the same
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
some of it is travel some of it is to
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
attend events between the United States
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
and Canada for example last year the
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
Canadian trade Council hosted
 
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:11.579 align:start position:0%
a contention from
 
01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:14.579 align:start position:0%
a contingent from Quebec to come down to
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester and tour the armi facility
 
01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:20.780 align:start position:0%
there Dean cayman's
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
facility and it was a it was a really
 
01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:27.059 align:start position:0%
really good event but those funds helped
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor things like that as well as
 
01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.890 align:start position:0%
sponsor things like that as well as
allowing

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
as well as allowing members to attend
 
01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:41.579 align:start position:0%
meetings like CSG because they have a
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
United States Canadian function there as
 
01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.450 align:start position:0%
United States Canadian function there as
well

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
it actually looks like if I mean it
 
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
actually looks like you only spent 35
 
01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
3600 this year or last year
 
01:07:59.089 --> 01:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't look like you're coming
 
01:08:01.609 --> 01:08:01.619 align:start position:0%
close we check coming over here it looks
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
like there's just over 6 000 in the
 
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.990 align:start position:0%
like there's just over 6 000 in the
budget

01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
um for for the biennium uh and that
 
01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
money I expect will be spent before the
 
01:08:13.849 --> 01:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
end of this fiscal year
 
01:08:13.859 --> 01:08:14.809 align:start position:0%
end of this fiscal year
the

01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:14.819 --> 01:08:15.950 align:start position:0%
the
uh

01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.110 align:start position:0%
uh
yes

01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
so the the Canadian trade Council put on
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
um historically we've done different
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
things crossing the border back and
 
01:08:28.249 --> 01:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
forth and taking turns and this year was
 
01:08:29.809 --> 01:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's turn and they had an
 
01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
event in the fall which spent the week
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
they had to save up their funds from
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
last year to spend at the event this
 
01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:43.729 align:start position:0%
last year to spend at the event this
year

01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.739 --> 01:08:46.370 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:49.970 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
and then a couple things I'm going to
 
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
let Aaron jump in here as well but just
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
a couple of things with hb2 that that I
 
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.590 align:start position:0%
a couple of things with hb2 that that I
noticed

01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
noticed
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
it talks about the uh the board of
 
01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.030 align:start position:0%
it talks about the uh the board of
Auctioneers

01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
Auctioneers
 
01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
on line 13 on that page
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh it says the board with the approval
 
01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
of the Secretary of State shall adopt
 
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
rules pursuant to RSA 541a and so I
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
would suggest that if they're moving to
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh generally speaking
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
there are a number of boards uh
 
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
commissions and licenses that are being
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
removed from the Secretary of State's
 
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
office in house bill 2.
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
20 years ago the Secretary of State's
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
office was the repository for those
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
types of entities in fact that the board
 
01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:05.300 align:start position:0%
of licensure and certification was
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and in the
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
interim a new agency has been created
 
01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:15.179 align:start position:0%
where most of those boards and
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
commissions have been moved to
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
um there were some stragglers left in
 
01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:22.460 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:27.620 align:start position:0%
Bill bondsman
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
regulated by our division of Securities
 
01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.209 align:start position:0%
regulated by our division of Securities
um

01:10:32.209 --> 01:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's only one of those maybe two that
 
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
are actually licensed
 
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
um you know picture uh a bounty hunter I
 
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
mean that's basically what it is
 
01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:43.729 align:start position:0%
mean that's basically what it is
um

01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh so there aren't there you know
 
01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.270 align:start position:0%
uh so there aren't there you know
there's

01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
just one or two licensed individuals in
 
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for that purpose
 
01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.630 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for that purpose
um

01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh athletic agents
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's any that are
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
currently registered in New Hampshire if
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
there are there's only one or two
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
we have Hawkers and Peddlers licenses
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
which does not generate a lot of Revenue
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
and so things like that so everything
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
that is being proposed to be moved out
 
01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
of the Department of State we really
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
don't have an objection to
 
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
Aaron do you want anything
 
01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:34.100 align:start position:0%
um the the Hawkers and Peddlers and the
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
sports agents both of those are
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled in House Bill too just to be
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
simply eliminated not just moved out so
 
01:11:41.699 --> 01:11:43.610 align:start position:0%
simply eliminated not just moved out so
yeah

01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
and again we would not object to that
 
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
do you have Mr secretary do you have a
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
list of those agencies that you could
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
give to Mr Hoffman and Melissa just so
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
him when they're all on the same page
 
01:11:59.209 --> 01:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
with you have like you said no problem
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
with any of those being reassigned or
 
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
abolished right and I'll get that too Mr
 
01:12:09.370 --> 01:12:09.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll yield to it or
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh so one thing I would like to add is
 
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
that the house and the Senate are very
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
busy this year
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
um especially with election laws but
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
some some related to our department
 
01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
having to do with Health and Human
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
Services or uh the Commerce Committee
 
01:12:27.239 --> 01:12:29.090 align:start position:0%
Services or uh the Commerce Committee
and

01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that any of the bills
 
01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
that are making their way through the
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
process right now actually have
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
Appropriations with them so that's one
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
thing that I would like to bring to your
 
01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:38.630 align:start position:0%
thing that I would like to bring to your
attention

01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
um the Senate has already passed a few
 
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
that do not have Appropriations
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
um they're bipartisan supported bills so
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that especially since the
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
house has some
 
01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
similar almost exact bills that seem to
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
have a lot of support that their will
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
that you will be getting house bills
 
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
sooner than the Senate ones but I just
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring to your attention
 
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
um there's a a an election portal that
 
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
is going to be that the Senate has
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
passed already and the cost of that is
 
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.689 align:start position:0%
passed already and the cost of that is
between

01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
um about 500 000 in the first year and
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
then ongoing between two and three
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars annually after
 
01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.430 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars annually after
that

01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
um a vital records related bill that the
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
Senate um floor will be hearing um
 
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
Thursday it passed out a committee and
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
the net effect of that would be
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
approximately three hundred thousand
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
dollars in the first year and two
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in Lost revenue
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
revenue going forward for a vital
 
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
records division
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
um and then just some smaller ones where
 
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
the incremental cost when looking at it
 
01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
individually as a bill is not much safe
 
01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
35 to 55 000 a year or maybe a little
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
bit of extra time for our elections
 
01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.729 align:start position:0%
bit of extra time for our elections
division

01:13:58.729 --> 01:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
um but that when you put all of them
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
together we might need somebody else to
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
help support that going forward so
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
something to bring to your attention I
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
know the LBA does a good job of tracking
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
all the bills that have passed out of
 
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
the different houses and um
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to bring those to your
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
attention as time goes on because I know
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
so are these bills with fiscal notes
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
that we haven't seen because I don't
 
01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
there have been quite a few in the
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
Senate side but we haven't had a lot
 
01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.630 align:start position:0%
Senate side but we haven't had a lot
here

01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
the house election law committee has
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
still is holding several of them I don't
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what your cutoff date is I
 
01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.450 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what your cutoff date is I
know

01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so for bills to come to us as a
 
01:14:55.729 --> 01:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
second committee already gone so
 
01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
yes that's a good point and there's also
 
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for pointing that out and
 
01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
that's one other thing I wanted to bring
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
up is that there is a bill that house
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
election law is undertaking right now
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
that did not come to us for a fiscal
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
note which would have shouldn't have
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
come to us for a fiscal note so um if
 
01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
that does pass I will bring that to your
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
attention and go to the LBA to have a
 
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
so moving right along anything else you
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
yeah the the only other thing is that
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
every four years we have a presidential
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
primary and the uh the budget currently
 
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
supports that expense
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
which will be in the next fiscal year
 
01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.450 align:start position:0%
which will be in the next fiscal year
and

01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
you know the only problem we'll have is
 
01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
as Aaron said you know some of these
 
01:15:52.729 --> 01:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
legislative specials passed uh pass it
 
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
will uh
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
be difficult to meet the costs if there
 
01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
isn't an additional appropriation that
 
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
goes along with it
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
now could you give us a little
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
background on the Hava funds and there's
 
01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
been a lot of stuff out there about the
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
need for new voting machines the cost of
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
same and where the money's coming from
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
for the new voting machines
 
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
is really two separate topics there the
 
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
voting machines and then the Java funds
 
01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:26.780 align:start position:0%
the help America vote Act was passed in
 
01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:28.669 align:start position:0%
the help America vote Act was passed in
2022

01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
and shortly after that New Hampshire
 
01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:33.620 align:start position:0%
received about 17 million dollars
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
in Hava funds
 
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
the um there was a federal mandate that
 
01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
all states had to create a Statewide
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
centralized voter database with those
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
funds they had to place accessible
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
voting equipment in each polling place
 
01:16:52.729 --> 01:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
for individuals with disabilities
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh they had to conduct extensive poll
 
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
worker training
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
the funds could also be used for voter
 
01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:03.020 align:start position:0%
education and
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement activity by the State
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office on the Java
 
01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.229 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office on the Java
laws

01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
there were two types of funds that came
 
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
through in the initial uh
 
01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.010 align:start position:0%
through in the initial uh
payments

01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
one was called Title One funds which
 
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
could be used
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
for the general Improvement of Elections
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
provided it was for a new program and
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
not sustaining something that was
 
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
already existing
 
01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
and then the the
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
majority of the funds the title II funds
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
were for actually meeting the mandates
 
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
of the help America vote act that could
 
01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
not be spent on anything else other than
 
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
let's say wide voter database
 
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
accessible equipment poll worker
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
training and so over uh at the time the
 
01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
legislature decided to create what we
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
call the election fund
 
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
to house the Hava money
 
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
and put a requirement at the time that
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
we could spend one twentieth
 
01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
of those funds in any given year with
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
the id idea being that we would hold the
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
principal amount
 
01:18:15.729 --> 01:18:15.739 align:start position:0%
as long into the future as we could
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
surviving off the interest
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and uh you know funding the
 
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
programs that way
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
and so here we are 20 years later
 
01:18:29.689 --> 01:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
there's still 12.8 million dollars in
 
01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:31.580 align:start position:0%
the election fund
 
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
and we've been able to continue those
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
those programs we're on probably the
 
01:18:36.239 --> 01:18:37.610 align:start position:0%
those programs we're on probably the
Third

01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
Third
 
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
generation of accessible voting
 
01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
equipment in the polling places we're
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
real rebuilding actually replacing the
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
Legacy Legacy voter database that we
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
have which will be completed sometime
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
this summer
 
01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.729 align:start position:0%
this summer
uh

01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:52.739 --> 01:18:53.410 align:start position:0%
uh
the

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:53.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
funds annually are being spent on uh
 
01:19:00.649 --> 01:19:00.659 align:start position:0%
maintaining the Statewide voter database
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
and a really extensive well done poll
 
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
worker education program
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
um I should say that in the interim when
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
they initially passed we could spend one
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
twentieth we're now down to 112. so um
 
01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
and and that translates into about a
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
more recently in 2018
 
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
we received roughly three million
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
dollars in additional Haba funds to be
 
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
used for
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
cyber security primarily
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
um at the time that was the crisis of
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
the day and so you know our our system
 
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
is pretty well protected that way
 
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
because we have used the money for
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
security measures uh in our information
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
technology systems related to elections
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then of course
 
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
the elections in 2020 we had the
 
01:19:55.630 --> 01:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh
 
01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
in full loan scale and we received
 
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
another 3.3 million dollars in Harbor
 
01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:04.669 align:start position:0%
another 3.3 million dollars in Harbor
funds

01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
to be spent just to address the pandemic
 
01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:08.270 align:start position:0%
to be spent just to address the pandemic
issues

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
that entire amount with the exception of
 
01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
about three hundred thousand dollars was
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
sent directly to the cities and towns to
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
reimburse them for the additional costs
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
of conducting an election and we did
 
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
that on the basis of the number of
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that each Town sent out
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
because there was a dramatic increase at
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
the time in the number of absentee
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
ballots that were requested
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
and voted on and then the remaining
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
roughly three hundred thousand dollars
 
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
we spent on a CPA firm to handle the
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
record keeping that was required to meet
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
the federal audit of those hovel funds
 
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
that were that were spent on the
 
01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.189 align:start position:0%
that were that were spent on the
pandemic

01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:20:49.199 --> 01:20:50.630 align:start position:0%
pandemic
um

01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:54.729 --> 01:20:54.739 align:start position:0%
so that money was gone we are currently
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
in line to receive another one million
 
01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:58.430 align:start position:0%
in line to receive another one million
dollars

01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
in Hava security funds three percent of
 
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
which have to be spent on security and
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
then and then the balance we could spend
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
on you know meeting the
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the help America
 
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
vote Act
 
01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:13.250 align:start position:0%
vote Act
um

01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
which will bring our balance up uh
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
then we have the issue of the electronic
 
01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
ballot counting devices the voting
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
machines that are used in polling places
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
those the machines are currently used
 
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
are reaching the end of their uh
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
functional life although I believe we
 
01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
could squeeze a couple more elections
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
out of them if we add to
 
01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
but at the same time the Bell luck
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
commission is working with us
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
in a very aggressive way to get ready to
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
approve the you know the next generation
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
of ballot counting devices
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh in fact in the upcoming town meeting
 
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
elections next week
 
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
we're going to be testing three
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
different manufacturers devices in four
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
towns in New Hampshire
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
Londonderry and Milford will be depended
 
01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
we'll be testing a device manufactured
 
01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
by Dominion
 
01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh Winchester will be testing a device
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
made by es and S and Ashland will be
 
01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
testing a device made by clear ballot
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to have members of our staff
 
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general staff
 
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
monitoring that over the course of the
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
election and then in the days following
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
the election there's going to be an
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
audit of each of those devices at the
 
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
polling places where they were used
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can confirm the accuracy of
 
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
the um technology is much newer than
 
01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
than the current accumo machine which is
 
01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
an optical scan technology
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's simply that technology simply uses
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
light to measure marks on the ballot and
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
and Records votes based on where those
 
01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
marks are made
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
the newer technology is digital scan
 
01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
technology so an image of every single
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
ballot front and back can be recorded by
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
those devices and used for auditing
 
01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.250 align:start position:0%
those devices and used for auditing
purposes

01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.209 align:start position:0%
purposes
um

01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:20.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
generally the legislature passed in the
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
last couple of sessions audit programs
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
one of which is a high using a high
 
01:23:31.729 --> 01:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
speed scanner to
 
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
to count the ballots using the digital
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
technology it is pretty impressive in in
 
01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
what that can do and certainly verified
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
the accuracy of the results of the
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
current accuvote machines that we're
 
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
it is up to the individual towns to
 
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not they're going to
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
use a ballot counting machine in their
 
01:23:55.689 --> 01:23:55.699 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
and it is the responsibility of the
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
towns to pay for the elections that take
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
place at the local level whether it's a
 
01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
local election or a state election
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
the towns that have decided to use
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
battle accounting devices are saving
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
money by using that instead of having to
 
01:24:17.209 --> 01:24:17.219 align:start position:0%
hire teams to come in and count the
 
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
ballots at the end of the night
 
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
um you know we believe that that is a
 
01:24:26.930 --> 01:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
cost that is the responsibility of the
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
Town replacing those machines I know
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
that there are many towns that have a uh
 
01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
you know a fund where they're saving
 
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
money for the future purchase of a new
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
accounting device
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
there have been proposals before the
 
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
legislature for several sessions now
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
to use the hobby funds to spend the
 
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
hobby monies down
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
for the purchase of equipment among
 
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.350 align:start position:0%
other things
um

01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
we believe that the program that we have
 
01:25:00.110 --> 01:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
been maintaining using the the interest
 
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
balance of those funds
 
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh has been very efficient and very
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
effective and as long as we keep that
 
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
balance healthy it will be
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
a long time before we have to go to the
 
01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taxpayers and say we have
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
to fund these programs now through the
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:21.830 align:start position:0%
general fund
um

01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
and that's the danger of spending the
 
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
fund balance down on special projects
 
01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:28.790 align:start position:0%
fund balance down on special projects
foreign

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
we are receiving additional Java funds
 
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
that are taking us above and beyond the
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
12 times and so we are open to a
 
01:25:40.189 --> 01:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
one-time program where we may be able to
 
01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
help with the cost of uh things like new
 
01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
ballot counting devices but when we do
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
that we want to do it in a uniform way
 
01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:52.100 align:start position:0%
that treats every town and City fairly
 
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
and helps them you know improve the
 
01:25:58.129 --> 01:25:58.139 align:start position:0%
conduct of Elections generally in New
 
01:25:58.139 --> 01:25:59.030 align:start position:0%
conduct of Elections generally in New
Hampshire

01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
so that's where we're at with that Mr
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
chair hopefully that answered your
 
01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:05.330 align:start position:0%
chair hopefully that answered your
question

01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
it did thank you very much other
 
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
questions represent McGuire
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
I think way yeah anyways
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
um are there multiple models of each
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
machine so if a town is a Tiny Town they
 
01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
get a cheaper machine than a for their
 
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
Manchester they need a
 
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:26.219 align:start position:0%
higher capacity machine
 
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a negotiation that we
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
have to have with the companies that
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
manufacture the machines the trend over
 
01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
time has been that these companies
 
01:26:38.530 --> 01:26:38.540 align:start position:0%
have developed ballot counting machines
 
01:26:42.169 --> 01:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
but they also want to sell a suite of
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
package you know a suite of other
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
services for example uh
 
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
you know a ballot creation software so
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
that you know you create your own ballot
 
01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
but it can only be used with their
 
01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
ballot accounting device
 
01:26:58.380 --> 01:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
ballot accounting device
um

01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
way too expensive for you know many
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
towns in New Hampshire so what we're
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
looking for primarily is just a
 
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
standalone battle accounting device we
 
01:27:13.129 --> 01:27:13.139 align:start position:0%
did test a device in the general
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
election that used open source software
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
the software worked great but the
 
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
hardware that was used for that device
 
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
was very lacking and so they're trying
 
01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
to make improvements to be under
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
consideration New Hampshire is a small
 
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
market for these devices so it's not
 
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
going to make sense for New Hampshire to
 
01:27:34.810 --> 01:27:34.820 align:start position:0%
decide to use more than two
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
companies ideally it would be one like
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
we have now so
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
um you know we are concerned about the
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
economies of scale and making them
 
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
affordable and functional and and that's
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
part of the equation
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
as the number of absentee ballots gone
 
01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
back to pre-pandemic levels or yes yes
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
okay good let's talk about your budget
 
01:27:59.159 --> 01:28:00.110 align:start position:0%
okay good let's talk about your budget
um

01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
other funds is is the biggest section is
 
01:28:06.169 --> 01:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
that business license fees or something
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
page 152.
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
which um which department are you in the
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
whole department the state this is the
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
grand total kind of thing
 
01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
at the top of page 152 it says other
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
funds 8 million
 
01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.659 --> 01:28:42.709 align:start position:0%
 
Facebook

01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.719 --> 01:28:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
so Paula has informed me that those are
 
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
funds that are charged in corporations
 
01:28:54.649 --> 01:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
and securities that go to the general
 
01:28:54.659 --> 01:28:56.930 align:start position:0%
and securities that go to the general
fund

01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:28:58.970 --> 01:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
they lapse I guess they lapse the
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
general fund right
 
01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.290 align:start position:0%
general fund right
yeah

01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
so those are fees on
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
corporations right of some kind yeah
 
01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
they would be they would be charges I
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
suppose you could call them fees for
 
01:29:13.629 --> 01:29:13.639 align:start position:0%
certain registrations
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and so your general fund usage you
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
actually use two million but you want to
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
bump that up to three
 
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
so that seems like a significant
 
01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
looking at that so fiscal year 2022
 
01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
actual General funds 2 million seventy
 
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
three thousand we definitely don't have
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.450 --> 01:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand I guess you had a
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
lot of federal funds in 2022 which
 
01:30:11.050 --> 01:30:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:19.930 --> 01:30:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
which can you tell me what number we
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
have for 2023
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
2.6 yeah we have 2.6 correct right so
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
the actual for 2022 is much less right
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
so you must have elapsed
 
01:30:39.649 --> 01:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
quite a bit or something like that
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
like we can find out what the what the
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
difference was for that I I do want to
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
point out that a lot of the general fund
 
01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
line right there
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of increase in rent that
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
has occurred over the years from
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
Department of admin Securities and we
 
01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
can't control that number on what they
 
01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139 align:start position:0%
charge us
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
um we we have
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
three different locations of where we're
 
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
located one in the State House second
 
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:09.780 align:start position:0%
floor and then third floor in the
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
um Annex of the State House corporations
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
and securities is over there and then we
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
have the archives building where
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
archives vital records and hover are
 
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
located we get charged rent for all of
 
01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:21.590 align:start position:0%
located we get charged rent for all of
those

01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's been a significant increase I don't
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
know if other departments have mentioned
 
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
that previously no so yeah maybe you
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
could point out the line or the page
 
01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
earlier the b28 line item 28. okay class
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
28. yeah okay
 
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
all right but I can I will find out for
 
01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
you what the what the difference was for
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
22 to 23.
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
and you got a considerable federal funds
 
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
in 2022 1.6 million
 
01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
and you're expecting more like 1.2
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.030 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
so the 2020
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
22 would have been
 
01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:12.050 align:start position:0%
22 would have been
um

01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
some homophones yeah well I'm thinking
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
and then you know the additional funds
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
coming in would be the one million
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
dollars plus it requires a 20 match so
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
would you like a breakdown of the 1.6
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
that we had in 22 Yeah and how it
 
01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
compares to what you expect going
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
forward yeah my my guess is that would
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
be the variance in the Java funds from
 
01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
year to year and tell us about the six
 
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
added employees
 
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.570 align:start position:0%
added employees
uh

01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
been making some changes within the
 
01:32:59.709 --> 01:32:59.719 align:start position:0%
department uh generally
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
focused primarily on the information
 
01:33:06.169 --> 01:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
technology services
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
um we are putting a business analyst in
 
01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
each of our divisions so that that
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
person can understand uh what the
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
business needs are of the office and the
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
customers and then be able to translate
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
those needs uh into the way the software
 
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
programs are developed so that we're
 
01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
working efficiently and we're on top of
 
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
contracts and and all of those items
 
01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
the the Staffing really is is
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
pretty much one position in each of the
 
01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
major divisions
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
so it's not a it's not a dramatic
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
increase but they are serving really
 
01:33:52.970 --> 01:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
important functions uh we are also going
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
through uh a transition of employees
 
01:33:59.330 --> 01:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
primarily because of retirement we've
 
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
had a lot of long time employees now
 
01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
that are starting to leave a tremendous
 
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
amount of knowledge going with them and
 
01:34:09.370 --> 01:34:09.380 align:start position:0%
it's tough to find one person that can
 
01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
you know do the job of the individual
 
01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
that was there before although we are
 
01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:19.739 align:start position:0%
acquiring some very competent new staff
 
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
um and we're having the same issues uh
 
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
that other departments are in terms of a
 
01:34:27.890 --> 01:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
labor shortage and trying to keep it
 
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
full Staffing
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
do you have a lot of open positions
 
01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh we have open positions in pollinating
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay so about 10 percent
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
further questions from members of The
 
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
Division I got one thing representative
 
01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:55.610 align:start position:0%
Division I got one thing representative
Hewitt

01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
Hewitt
 
01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:56.570 align:start position:0%
Hewitt
um

01:34:56.570 --> 01:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:59.930 --> 01:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
one of the things I think that was or is
 
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:03.179 align:start position:0%
in your department have the the bail
 
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
bondsman as opposed to Baylor
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
commissioners uh
 
01:35:09.169 --> 01:35:09.179 align:start position:0%
have you folks had any contact from the
 
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
justice department or anybody concerning
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
that because the there is a there is a
 
01:35:18.169 --> 01:35:18.179 align:start position:0%
there's legislation being prepared
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
to completely overhaul the uh the system
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
of bail and in criminal cases and
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
I don't know where that's going to go
 
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
but how much activity do you have I I
 
01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
remember a bill commissioner in
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh had an office right over
 
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
where one of the judges had an office
 
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
um but is there much activity in the
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
bail bond bail bondsman act uh
 
01:35:49.970 --> 01:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
no it has been declining over the years
 
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
and you know 20 years ago there might
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
have been eight uh but today there's
 
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
only one or two yeah okay
 
01:36:00.649 --> 01:36:00.659 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I think that you had wanted to
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
hear about the new position that is
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to our
 
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
thanks Aaron
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
we we have the ombudsman
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
it's a significant line on your budget I
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
think it was like 128 000 a year or
 
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
something that caught my eye so you do
 
01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:24.179 align:start position:0%
have the position filled and
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
the position is filled it was an
 
01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
appointment by the governor the office
 
01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:29.870 align:start position:0%
appointment by the governor the office
is

01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
just administratively attached to us so
 
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
we're providing the office space and uh
 
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
in the office equipment but the the
 
01:36:41.770 --> 01:36:41.780 align:start position:0%
right to know Ombudsman is
 
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
responsible for their own budget and
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
determining what the needs are and you
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
know convincing the governor's office if
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
that's what they need
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
Tom Kerr is the Zion budsman who
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
prior to this position was an employee
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
at admin services
 
01:37:04.729 --> 01:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
did lots of work with the right to know
 
01:37:04.739 --> 01:37:06.649 align:start position:0%
did lots of work with the right to know
area

01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
all right I did have a a budget question
 
01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:11.810 align:start position:0%
all right I did have a a budget question
um

01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a little follow-up on to
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's questioning
 
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
so your actual expenses on page 152 or
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
like 14.3 million
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
and yet in 23 the authorized was 11. I
 
01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
was just curious how and uh 22 you were
 
01:37:31.129 --> 01:37:31.139 align:start position:0%
able to cover that additional three I
 
01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
was looking through the budget and saw
 
01:37:35.209 --> 01:37:35.219 align:start position:0%
that there was some large expenses for
 
01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
elections I know we had a presidential
 
01:37:39.110 --> 01:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
election is that where some of that
 
01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:41.209 align:start position:0%
election is that where some of that
increase

01:37:41.209 --> 01:37:41.219 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
is from and you covered it with I'm
 
01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:45.830 align:start position:0%
is from and you covered it with I'm
assuming

01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
assuming
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
you see the page I'm on air and it's um
 
01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
so your actual expenses were 14 3 for 22
 
01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:58.510 align:start position:0%
so your actual expenses were 14 3 for 22
and

01:37:58.510 --> 01:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:01.090 --> 01:38:01.100 align:start position:0%
authorized for 23 or
 
01:38:04.729 --> 01:38:04.739 align:start position:0%
11.4 so it's kind of a curious in the
 
01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
the difference we spent 14.3 and 22 and
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
then had authorized 11.4
 
01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm going to turn to Paul again
 
01:38:24.770 --> 01:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
another explanation for that yeah
 
01:38:31.729 --> 01:38:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
budget them until we're sure that you
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
know we had space on the revenue we take
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
in okay so once we receive the revenue
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
um we're then able to appropriate it and
 
01:38:43.010 --> 01:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and that's why we see it that way
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
um one area that went up considerably is
 
01:38:49.370 --> 01:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
vital records
 
01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
there is a a large I.T project that
 
01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
they're undertaking
 
01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.270 align:start position:0%
they're undertaking
um

01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
and so there is a significant cost cost
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
involved with that and that made me most
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
they have a vital records Improvement
 
01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
fund that they used
 
01:39:20.570 --> 01:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
all is most if not all where that money
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
um is it okay if I just get back to
 
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's earlier
 
01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:26.390 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's earlier
question

01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
um so the Ombudsman that is attached to
 
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
our office again that we don't that the
 
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
governor appoints
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
um that gen that is the source of
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
General funds that we didn't used to
 
01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:41.219 align:start position:0%
have in our office so that's 128 and 24
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
and 136 and 25 so that would be where a
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
big general fund increase would have
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
now it's this individual's office on the
 
01:39:58.669 --> 01:39:58.679 align:start position:0%
second floor or somewhere else in your
 
01:40:00.890 --> 01:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
the ombudsman's office is on the third
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
floor over the ens for the time being
 
01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
they're getting ready to do a renovation
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
project there so they're going to be
 
01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.810 align:start position:0%
project there so they're going to be
asking

01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
other questions for the secretary or the
 
01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
for those who don't know Aaron was on
 
01:40:24.610 --> 01:40:24.620 align:start position:0%
finance with us and then abandoned us
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
went to this went to the Senate and then
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
abandoned the Senate and that's good to
 
01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
see where you are good to see you too
 
01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:34.739 align:start position:0%
your loss is our gained yes it certainly
 
01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
is it certainly is
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none I guess it's just a few
 
01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
little things you'll get back to us

01:41:19.570 --> 01:41:19.580 align:start position:0%
State's office I'm here on behalf of
 
01:41:21.649 --> 01:41:21.659 align:start position:0%
commissioner Bobby Stevens who's the
 
01:41:23.209 --> 01:41:23.219 align:start position:0%
chair of the boxing wrestling commission
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
but boxing and wrestling currently is
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
attached to the Secretary of State's
 
01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
office we provide them with the
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
administrative support that they need as
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
you can see they have a fairly small
 
01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.830 align:start position:0%
you can see they have a fairly small
budget

01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:43.550 align:start position:0%
budget
mostly

01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
um with um Personnel money which they
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
get the Commissioners get a per diem for
 
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
each event boxing and wrestling and also
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
now mixed martial arts which is part of
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
their purview
 
01:41:57.050 --> 01:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
um and some travel which is basically
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
but for mileage between the events
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
um and as you know it's a little they're
 
01:42:06.290 --> 01:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
looking to be moved from us to to the
 
01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:07.669 align:start position:0%
looking to be moved from us to to the
oplc

01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.930 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:42:17.930 --> 01:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:21.169 --> 01:42:21.179 align:start position:0%
Cena I do have one how many events do
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
they oversee in the course of a year do
 
01:42:26.689 --> 01:42:26.699 align:start position:0%
you know or you um typically like two or
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
three a month all that many yeah mostly
 
01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
smaller I mean not that you would see
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
advertised per se they have a couple of
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
big events a year they have a big WWE
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
event at the
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
I guess it's this new Arena now and
 
01:42:43.010 --> 01:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
natural trying to think what it's called
 
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
um in Manchester and another big boxing
 
01:42:48.290 --> 01:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
event but the rest are mostly smaller
 
01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
boxing events
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
um some held in Hampton
 
01:42:53.570 --> 01:42:53.580 align:start position:0%
