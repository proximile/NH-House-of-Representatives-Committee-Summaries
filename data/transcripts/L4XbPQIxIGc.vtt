00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
I open the work session for the children
 
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
and family law subcommittee that is
 
00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 align:start position:0%
going to be considering House Bill
 
00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 align:start position:0%
499 the court shall admit any evidence
 
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
or testimony in any form which the
 
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
respondent believes will be favorable
 
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
and 475 the judge shall follow the rules
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
of evidence in admitting um items into
 
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.990 align:start position:0%
of evidence in admitting um items into
evidence

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh they're very similar bills so my
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
thought is to proceed with a general
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
discussion on Rules of Evidence uh and
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
then break it out into the two
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
particular bills um let me start with an
 
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
opening remark and um then we'll turn it
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
over anybody else uh on the work group
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
who wishes to share just a reminder that
 
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
this is a work session not a hearing
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
therefore um all of the pink cards that
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
people would like to sign in on are in
 
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
my pocket and you don't get one uh we
 
00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
can occasionally admit someone to answer
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
a brief and Technical question if we so
 
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
desire but it's not a hearing with
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
people giving evidence we've heard a lot
 
00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
of evidence and a lot of
 
00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.629 align:start position:0%
of evidence and a lot of
testimony

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
indicating that uh some judges seem to
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
be w way too broad in their
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
discretionary powers and in fact um a
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
wonderful book I it should be on the
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
best seller list called New Hampshire
 
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
Court rules annotated Rules of Evidence
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
the Chief Justice gave me one of these a
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
couple months ago and I've read it four
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
times it's 280 Pages lots of nice
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
footnotes and cross references and it
 
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
makes it abundantly clear that in New
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the
 
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh Circuit Court The Rules of Evidence
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
in this book um are at the total
 
00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
discretion of the judge the judge may
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
choose to honor one of these rules or
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
not and the book gives the reason why
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
that is because the judge needs the
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
discretion to make things in his or her
 
00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
opinion to be fair and good for everyone
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
the question question is however does
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
that take place and according to some
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've heard some people
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
believe the judge in his or her case was
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
way too broad in admitting things other
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
people indicated the judge was way too
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
restrictive still other people believed
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
that the judge was restrictive towards
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
men but not women and other people
 
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 align:start position:0%
believed it was women not men so the
 
00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:30.070 align:start position:0%
believed it was women not men so the
question

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
is what should we do about Rules of
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
Evidence the two bills before us lay
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
down blanket statements uh telling the
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
judge exactly what to do uh this is the
 
00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
case in
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
Vermont and we have learned that in
 
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont according to their rules rule of
 
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.070 align:start position:0%
Vermont according to their rules rule of
evidence

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
1101 family cases are not accepted that
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
the Rules of Evidence apply literally in
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
Vermont it is totally the opposite the
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty comes in that about 80% of
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
the cases heard in Family Court one or
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
both litigant are their prosay that is
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
to say they are representing themselves
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
lawyers some of these are very well read
 
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
in law most of them are not
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
and so when something comes up for
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
example the judge rules a piece of
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
evidence in and one of the litigants
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
does not like that many times the
 
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
litigant does not know what to do or the
 
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
litigant will much later in the trial
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
say oh I object to that in the Rules of
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
Evidence in New Hampshire objections
 
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
must be made as soon as possible as soon
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
as the judge allows a piece of evidence
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
in the other side protesting should say
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
objection secondly the other side must
 
00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:10.519 align:start position:0%
give a reason why that piece of evidence
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
should not be admitted other than just I
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
don't like it or it hurts my case many
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
people who are prade do not know that
 
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
what to do there are many other places
 
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
where uh rules of evidence that a judge
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
may use may be confusing
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
or not known to a litigant going
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
prosay uh the Same by the way is true if
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
a judge decides not to admit something
 
00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:41.959 align:start position:0%
into evidence objection must be
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
immediately made and the reason given in
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
fact if this does not occur and the
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
decision of the judge is
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
appealed that piece of evidence not
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
admitted cannot be admitted
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
in an appell at court it's too late or
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
if you wanted that piece of evidence
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
stricken and do not object and now it is
 
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
in the appell at court it's too late for
 
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
that as well so the question here is
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
what do we do especially when it seems
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps a judge is going too far one way
 
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
or the other or is tipped into an
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
imbalance should we like
 
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
Vermont just require everything in this
 
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
book be done by the judge or should we
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
keep it as it is now but find a way to
 
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that many people
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
have raised so that's my sort of opening
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
Salvo I've um pretty much said this
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
several times to the others with me so
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
with that I'll shut up and just see who
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:05.150 align:start position:0%
 
speak

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
wrong yes so I I I agree I believe that
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
we we're on the right concept right now
 
00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
or the right uh rules of EV evidence uh
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
however tweaking
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
something um to balance the scales may
 
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
be something we look at uh as far as for
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
75 um you know it requires all evidence
 
00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:36.750 align:start position:0%
75 um you know it requires all evidence
be

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
presented uh then it asks for what
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
evidence is not presented um to be a
 
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
reason written um so it sort of
 
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
conflicts with what it what it what it
 
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.310 align:start position:0%
conflicts with what it what it what it
first

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:02.910 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
Frozen uh yeah so it's sort of conflicts
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh from the beginning where everything
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
will be presented uh to the starting in
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
uh the judge needs to write a reason as
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
to why it wasn't uh
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
admitted um so I'm not sure
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
if this is a correct Avenue to make any
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.550 align:start position:0%
if this is a correct Avenue to make any
fix

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.949 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
you all for being here today I know it's
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
cold in here you know I I'm conflicted
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
on this um just because when we say
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
something you know I've known quite a
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
few people that have had their own court
 
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
cases and stuff and it's always hard
 
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
whenever we think something's pertinent
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know the the overseer
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
of the situation also thinks it's
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
pertinent because it's all up to
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
individual you know your own own
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
perception and
 
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.750 align:start position:0%
perception and
stuff

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
I I think we would have to think long
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
and hard before we start to you know
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
encroach on the judges in a way that the
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
reason they are in the position they're
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
in is to be able to you know see things
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
impartially now in cases where we have
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
judges and I know that these are not the
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
norm right these are not the majority of
 
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing but the ones that we
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
are seeing where there's you know a lack
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
of well we say discretion maybe we have
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
it looks like moms are getting more
 
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
favor or fathers getting more favor
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
whichever way there are other states
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
Illinois being one that have um kind of
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
like a Judicial kind of an oversight
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
where they do have um almost like when
 
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
you're a student teacher you have the
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
principal kind of come sit in they do
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
have somebody that comes and sits in and
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
observes you know we've talked about
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
this before we've talked about the
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
recordings being turned on and off and
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
and all that I also want to be very
 
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the fact that when we
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
discuss how much evidence we're going to
 
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
make or you know if we're going to
 
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
decide that we're going to tell the
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
judges to take in all this evidence the
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
amount of time that that's going to take
 
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
I know that there are certainly um
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
litigants that would love to you know
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
hold up a case and give months and
 
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
months and months of hearsay and all
 
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:22.839 align:start position:0%
these other things so um you know saying
 
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
that they just have to take all that
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
evidence and would bog down our already
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
very busy court system so I just want to
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
think about those things when we're
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
thinking about you know making some kind
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
of legislation or whatever but I do not
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
think that either one of these um bills
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
hold uh a best case scenario for our
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
front well they're thinking of something
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh the five of
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
us um are this work group in children
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
and family law because the five of us up
 
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
here are also on the special committee
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
for the Family Division of Circuit Court
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
uh the clerk of the house ruled we could
 
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
not have a joint meeting so what I've
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
told the five of us here in the children
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
and family law work group is remember
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
everything we said and heard because
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking at this very
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
issue in our special
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
committee um we heard testimony on this
 
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
the other day so just that was uh buying
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
some time to see if the people to my
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
right have anything you'd like to share
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh Representatives ball or
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
McMahon Mr chairman I'll oh microphone I
 
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
us I talk too
 
00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:53.079 align:start position:0%
loud yeah thing I uh have a just in The
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
Narrative of what brought forth the this
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
um the particular Bill I'm referring
 
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
to uh it's 475 at this point at this
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
point I is to is to ensure that the
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide evidence at the
 
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
at the appropriate
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
time uh is a commitment to respect the
 
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
rights of both um both litigants on
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
either side
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
and that struck me as well struck me as
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
just in The Narrative of the bill that
 
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
that right would not be as a States
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
would not be limited to
 
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
a uh third party from the two litigants
 
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
determining what is an appropriate U
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
piece of evidence or not and have so
 
00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
that it would ensure it would be
 
00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.079 align:start position:0%
adjudicated in the discussion and
 
00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:46.759 align:start position:0%
presentation before the judge and then
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
the judge can make the decision or or
 
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
not can but makes the
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
decision that's why I thought that's why
 
00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
in my view I thought that uh in meeting
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
the challenges we Face based on the
 
00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.030 align:start position:0%
the challenges we Face based on the
early

00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
early
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
the early testimonies that we heard is
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
the um litigants would have their right
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
insured to be
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
heard and I and I wasn't seeing this I
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
did not see this as infringing on the
 
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
authority having jurisdiction which is
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
the judge says to ensure that the
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
authority has the evidence to then
 
00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
determine the
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that's what like to offer
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
that is consideration on 455 475 thank
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
anything I agree that I think we need to
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
take a closer look at this through the
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
special committee
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I do think there has to be an Avenue
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
for allowing evidence which um we do
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
have I I think that what we were hearing
 
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
or what at least I was hearing in all
 
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
the testimony is that people want to be
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
heard they want an opportunity to
 
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
present themselves and I think when that
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
does not happen um that is when we're
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:12.110 align:start position:0%
 
courts

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay in talking with several Family
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
Court Justices and having sat in on
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
Nashua Family
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
Court my experience was that the
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
judges were quite open to allowing
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
pieces of evidence to come in except for
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
a couple
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
of kinds of
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
evidences and they're both actually
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
addressed in the New Hampshire Rules of
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
Evidence book one of these is if the
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
probative value of the piece of
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
evidence um is less than any and I'll
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
use my term now
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
besmirching of someone's
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
character um that's not allowed you
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
don't bring in a piece of evidence
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
that's basically an attack piece more
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
than it is anything else secondly um the
 
00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
judges that I have spoken with are
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
concerned with somebody just churning
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
the case and there's a couple of
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
references in rules of evidence that a
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
judge should not admit a piece of
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
evidence if that piece of evidence does
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
not further the knowledge of the case if
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
it's repetitive you know he didn't pick
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
up Billy when he said on Tuesday then
 
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
the next piece of evidence is he didn't
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
do it on Thursday well we've already
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
established a problem uh because to keep
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
churning the case like this with
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
requests for evidence to come in that
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't help the case one way or the
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
other is what wastes time and uh so then
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
the this begs the question is every
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
judge observant of those two things I
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
just said do judges bring in pieces of
 
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
evidence where the probative value is
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
minimal and the sming value is great
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
does that happen do judges keep letting
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
one party churn churn churn with more
 
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
pieces of evidence and that's where um
 
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
you know even if these rules were
 
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.310 align:start position:0%
you know even if these rules were
followed

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
followed
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
are they followed if it says don't do
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
this and the judge is doing this a Bill
 
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
signed into law doesn't actually Advance
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
anything because they're already
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
breaking the law you've got
 
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
um so therefore the discussion that some
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
of us have had with the justice
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
department was there's a couple of
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
things that we probably need number one
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
we need better education for the protic
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
an how many prosay litigants know how
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
and when you object that a piece of
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
evidence is allowed in or not allowed in
 
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
um we were having a discussion
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
beforehand that um there are videos you
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
can watch there are handouts you can
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
have but the justices I spoke with said
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
but they can always be made better
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
bigger Fuller richer
 
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
um that may be something we explore in
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
some greater detail in the special
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
committee also um the conversation some
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
of us had was and this goes to the point
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
about uh that representative Greg made
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
about uh student teachers being
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
monitored my suggestion was that the
 
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
judges in Family
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
Division are monitored more frequently
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
and in particular
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
if there seems to be numbers of
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
complaints about that particular
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
judge um I Heard certain names of Judges
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned a lot more during all of our
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
time of um hearings than I heard other
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
judges names so maybe there are a few
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
judges who are way too broad or way too
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
narrow and once again how can we keep
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
the wisdom of giving judges
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
discretion yet re them in or expand them
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
out or rebalance them if they're
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
outliers and that I believe is best done
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
not by a hard fast rule that may
 
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely be the wrong rule to have in
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
a case across the board but have more
 
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring more continuing ed um any any
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that representative Greg um
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
I absolutely agree I had something to
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
say and then I was like like it went
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
blank I think my brain froze sorry about
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
that um you know I did just look up I
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
Googled super quick like what to do like
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
for State of New Hampshire if you're
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's all here like I don't even know
 
00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:12.919 align:start position:0%
that we always run into the problem
 
00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559 align:start position:0%
though these are emotional cases right
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that we're seeing over
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
and over and by the way the judges that
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
we had mentioned over and over are no
 
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
longer judges and that's probably for
 
00:23:26.269 --> 00:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
good reason but I because the judicial
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
system kind of has a check and balance
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
however I do think kind of observing or
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
having somebody that drops in on courts
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
from time to time where they don't
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily know that they're going to
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
be there that's that's kind of a better
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
way to do it the
 
00:23:41.549 --> 00:23:41.559 align:start position:0%
forms I know that there and that's
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
something we're going to talk about
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
later today but I know that they're
 
00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:45.559 align:start position:0%
working on streamlining them they have
 
00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
made progress on them but honestly I
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
went through and I looked at it and of
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
course I you know I've been to court
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
with other people and stuff before so I
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of background
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge but it's it really is all here
 
00:23:59.710 --> 00:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
it's just a a matter of the emotions in
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
a case whether or not you can slow down
 
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
and look at it and read what you're you
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
know what you're supposed to do there
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
are videos on here too so I think
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
that I just want to be mindful of how
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
many cases we're hearing about versus
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
how many I don't want to create a bigger
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
problem because the majority of this is
 
00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:18.710 align:start position:0%
problem because the majority of this is
going

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
well um how does one access that what's
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
the Google line well I Googled um New
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Court representing
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
prosay that's all I did and then it
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
takes you to courts. nh.gov and I've
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
done it a few different ways I kind of
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
look you know representing yourself New
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it it always brings you to
 
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
this and then there it takes you to
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
self-help and then you got fors and fees
 
00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
you got videos what to expect your first
 
00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
day of Court um you know lot preparing
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
for court there's a whole section here
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
before your court date what to do on
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
your court date um even things like
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
arrive on time I mean that's all on here
 
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
to to anyone's
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge if you file a
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
case and then they get back to you and
 
00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
say your case will be heard on November
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
14th is there a statement that says and
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
in your preparation you would be wise to
 
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
access because how would somebody not
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
know they don't know what they don't
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
know yeah well I do know I uh as
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
observed and conquered and I do know
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
they're on the they have the computer
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
where you can fill out forms and stuff
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
they actually had a link to come and and
 
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
look at this and I do I did hear a clerk
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
telling somebody too that they could
 
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
access it this way I talked to a clerk
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
and asked you know what they do if
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
there's a prosay and they do advise them
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
to go to this but then of course that's
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
personal choice how much of that you
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:25:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
judge mace
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
um testified before some of us on
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
specifically Rules of
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
Evidence and God bless him I uh I got in
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
touch with him and I said give me some
 
00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
statement give me a big statement on
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
what we're concerned about and he is
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
stuck in traffic trying to get off the
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
cape so he dictated it to a staffer over
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
the phone who typed it out and then it
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
was sent to me and then then to us um
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
but he
 
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh he covers three areas one
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
is what I think we've been saying up
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
here that we really do want to keep our
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
judges uh free to apply Rules of
 
00:26:56.909 --> 00:26:56.919 align:start position:0%
Evidence as they see fit because every
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
case is different
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
and he even mentions Vermont where that
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
is not the case and how much difficulty
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
it has for people who are not lawyers to
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
wend their way through the system where
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you know pick a rule the
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
other party has done
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
homework and you haven't because you
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
didn't know you don't own this book
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
amazingly um and so now you're caught
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
flat-footed and how is that fair and the
 
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
judge is not supposed to be the lawyer
 
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
you know so we uh spon is not a good uh
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
legal action so how do you know you
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
don't know the judge can't tell you well
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
you should have brought this up so he
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
said that first in other words tweak
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
what we've got rather than replicating
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
what he believes isn't working in
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
Vermont but then he also added a section
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
on even more uh narrative and videos and
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
handouts than we have presently and even
 
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519 align:start position:0%
louder uh hey look this stuff up for
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
folks if you're going prosay and then he
 
00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
also said the Chief
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
Justice Mr chairman is very supportive
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
of your idea about reviewing judges more
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
frequently particularly with the
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
assistance of retired judges we would be
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
happy to talk with you about how um this
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
can be done so I think there is a
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
willingness on the part of the Judiciary
 
00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:28.039 align:start position:0%
to recognize they may have a judge who's
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
too broad or too narrow or who is
 
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
imbalanced um it doesn't rise to the
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
level of this is a bad judge and and yes
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
representative Greg there are names that
 
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
were mentioned who we just don't see on
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
the bench anymore these are good judges
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
let's say who do need some
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
inservice um continuing education on how
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
to come back into a better
 
00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
Norm okay I've just basically said my
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
opening statement in other words all
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
over again
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
anything else from us up here before we
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
go to particular bills themselves yeah
 
00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
uh I recall I believe it was Judge uh
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
lamir was it or lame lamir lamir um who
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
said There are some evidence that I'm
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
not considering because for example if
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
somebody badly characterizes the other
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
party and the judge isn't buying it
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
she's not looking for evidence to defend
 
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
yourself so I'm going to say no and I
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
could see a party getting upset saying
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
hey wait a minute this is you know so I
 
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
don't know if the judges could tell uh
 
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
could say at that moment that um yeah as
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
far as your character assassination uh
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not considering that I I you know I
 
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
don't believe that or whatever uh the
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
judge would say so that would because I
 
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
know if somebody characteriz uh badly
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
characterized me and I went to put into
 
00:29:56.509 --> 00:29:56.519 align:start position:0%
evidence to support my character and the
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
judge wouldn't allow it I'd be upset
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
because I'd be assuming that she's
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
buying the other party's uh bad
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
characterization of me so that was
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
another thing I was thinking of is of
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
those that were calling on were calling
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
upon um you know ween allowed to give
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
evidence um were they assuming that the
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
judge was buying the opposition uh you
 
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
know they're the other parties uh
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
whatever the other party said so I don't
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
know if a judge can say you know that's
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
not in question your character is not in
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
question to me for me um so I'm not
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
going to take evidence supporting your
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
character because it's not what I'm
 
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
considering right now uh representative
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
Greg you have a judge in the family and
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sure this sort of thing has come up
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
once or twice I do have a judge in the
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
family and you know I've grilled him on
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
certain things but also I used to watch
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
him in court I do know just from I'd
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
like to I he was not here he's in
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
Illinois so I like to focus on what
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
we've got on going on in the New
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire courts but the judge that we
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
observed did say you know when they
 
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
weren't going to allow evidence like
 
00:31:02.669 --> 00:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
this is why like she was very good about
 
00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:05.799 align:start position:0%
explaining why or what I will say also
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
it at courts. new hampshire. goov you
 
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
can also just Google Rules of Evidence
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
and they have it so you can just put in
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
a keyword so say you want to talk about
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
stalking say you want to talk about
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
something else um you can put that in
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
there and see about the Rules of
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
Evidence there are cases where
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
especially in cases of domestic violence
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse um there are certain
 
00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:29.799 align:start position:0%
things that is there's a big push that
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
you see that they want to have brought
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
in like maybe um the aggressor might
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
want to have the mental health history
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
brought up or something like that and so
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
that's things that we're generally
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
seeing that no you can't I know one of
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
um somebody that's testified here and
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
shared some of their work that was you
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
know kind of something they wanted to
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
those are things that can't be brought
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
up and I do hear the judge saying that's
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
not admissible you know because we can't
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
bring up this or whatever so I do I do
 
00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:00.039 align:start position:0%
think there's that and and I want to be
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
cognizant that everybody that says hey
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
they're not listening to me that's
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
exactly the perception that's your
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
reality and stuff we've had people come
 
00:32:09.149 --> 00:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
in here before that I thought man that
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
person was so aggressive I can't believe
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
that and then I went back and watched
 
00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
the YouTube and I was like okay maybe
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
that was my own bias hearing that a
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
little differently but it's hard to come
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
out of that and really watch and see
 
00:32:22.269 --> 00:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
what's happening because these are high
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know High emotional I mean these are
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
very important cases and everybody's
 
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
evidence is very important but once
 
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
again you know there there are ways to
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
look up Rules of Evidence without having
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
that book that you actually don't have
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
to read through the entire thing you
 
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
just put a keyword in and see what what
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
those rules are for that particular
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
thing it might be helpful the last two
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
lines of House Bill
 
00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
475 which is if evidence or testimony is
 
00:32:49.159 --> 00:32:49.990 align:start position:0%
475 which is if evidence or testimony is
not

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
admitted or we could even say is
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
admitted over the objection of a
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
litigant that the reason should be noted
 
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
that might be helpful to diffuse some
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
people thinking the judge is biased
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
against me I'm just you know throwing
 
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
that out as a
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
possibility um I did watch a moot court
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
trial um
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
where the litigant was bringing suit and
 
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
against the respondent for breach of
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
contract and the litigant
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to exclude the
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
respondent from describing in her own
 
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
words things but instead stick only to
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
the contract that was allegedly
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
breached and in one moot Court rendering
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
of this the litigant said I would like
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
to give three examples of how this
 
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
person cannot be
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
trusted and the judge said the probative
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
value of that is exceeded by this again
 
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
my word the bment of character in
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
another rendering of the same moot court
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
case the um litigant bringing suit said
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
your honor for the purpose of this I
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
wish to bring in a piece of evidence
 
00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:20.230 align:start position:0%
wish to bring in a piece of evidence
where

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.470 align:start position:0%
where
unemployment

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
appeal indicated by the person presiding
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
that the individual wanting unemployment
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
payouts uh was self-contradictory
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
the judge allowed that because it didn't
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
besmer character but oral testimony
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
could be impeached by the track record
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
of the person in a similar thing I'm
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
going to go to law school darn it you
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
know I'm really getting into this uh so
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
there's an example where I never knew
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
that until I watched this I never knew
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
that until I read this book four times
 
00:34:59.310 --> 00:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
and if the judge simply said no I'm not
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
admitting it I'd want to know why so
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
maybe there is something to
 
00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:08.839 align:start position:0%
suggest in our special committee
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
judges should the reason be noted in the
 
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
record or not I'm just throwing that out
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
possibility uh yeah I could agree with
 
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
that uh as long as a judge doesn't have
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
to review the test
 
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.270 align:start position:0%
to review the test
the

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.069 align:start position:0%
the
evidence

00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
um you know the example that I gave of
 
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know the judge saying yeah I
 
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
don't want that evidence of of your good
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
character because that's not I'm not
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
weighing in on that I think you have I
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
think you're of good character so that's
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
not an issue U that I could note I
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
didn't re receive evidence on character
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
because that wasn't uh that wasn't an
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
issue in my in my judgment um but you
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
know as long as that as long as a judge
 
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to review the evidence or
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
testimony um which if for any reason
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
evidence or testimony is not admitted
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
the reason shall be noted in the record
 
00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
so you like lines eight and nine of
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
Representative posts Bill 475 yeah the
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
the actually the amendment uh the
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
amendment yes did we weigh in on the
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
amendment in
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
recall we rain
 
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
that so but yeah I'm I like the
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
amendment much better the words at the
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
end of the amendment is much better uh
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
than the original but the difficulty
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
about the amendment to 475 starts on
 
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
line six the presiding judge Etc shall
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
follow the New Hampshire Rules of
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
Evidence when admitting such evidence
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
and testimony so to me that's not good
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
for reasons we've been discussing but
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
what follows is good in my
 
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
opinion yeah I I was just specifying uh
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
line eight and nine if we somehow could
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
extract line eight and nine in what we
 
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
do in special committee into our
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations and that could be a
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
point of further discussion I mean the
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is really really indicating
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
they want to work with us on this you
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
know they they see that there's a
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
concern and and they want to uh
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
alleviate it yes representative
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman parison I guess
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
I just needed a little clarification uh
 
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
representative Greg maybe I'm not sure
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
if I misheard you um you said the
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
aggressor wants a wants a mental health
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
evaluation I'm not exactly sure what
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:52.839 align:start position:0%
to um this is so on a specific case but
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
we'll keep it um confidential but anyway
 
00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.109 align:start position:0%
we'll keep it um confidential but anyway
um

00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
and this and I've seen it multiple
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
multiple times but if you have an abuse
 
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
let's say an abuser not just aggressor
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that happens is
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
you have you might have the uh victim or
 
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
the Survivor uh has been to some kind of
 
00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
like psychiatric help That's Not Unusual
 
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
right because they go through depression
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
they go through denial of you know kind
 
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
of the mental and the emotional stuff
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
that comes with that so there's
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
something there like you know they're
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
trying to kind of deal with life well an
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
aggressor will use that as a weapon to
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
say they're unstable they shouldn't have
 
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
the kids because they've been to this
 
00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
mental health they don't even
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily know what's in there but
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's another way to weaponize that
 
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
system to put that person in a more
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
vulnerable position because obviously
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
you talk to um you know a counselor or
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
something about
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
very uh private details right and
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes maybe you've talked about your
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
abuse sometimes you talked about other
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
things but to then say you know what I'm
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
going to the person other person say I'm
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
G to I want this as evidence I want all
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
these records opened up and I wanted in
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
there it's a further abuse and it's a
 
00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
further manipulation of the situation is
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
what it
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
is so I guess that's where my confusion
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
is because from the people that we were
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
hearing from there were cases where the
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
person who filed the DV complaint was
 
00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
actually the aggressor and
 
00:39:20.119 --> 00:39:22.030 align:start position:0%
actually the aggressor and
um

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
so and they were using the court to
 
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
weaponize Yes um and that's where I get
 
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
concerned so how does a person who's now
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
been accused of DV how do they fight
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
that especially when it starts coming
 
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
into child custody and temporary orders
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
and how do they bring forward evidence
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
to say that maybe the person who
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
actually filed the DV does have mental
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
illness and this is part of their mental
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
illness to bring forward um this type of
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
retaliation or aggressive behavior
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
toward who is actually the victim um
 
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
who's being accused so I I
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
I think that's where I'm I'm just
 
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
concerned when evidence is not allowed
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
to show that the person who's being
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
accused has actually been the
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
victim well I think that if you have so
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
if you have a victim saying you know
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to fet it all out I'd like
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
to show you to prove my own you know
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm not like this or that's a
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
little bit different than somebody
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
coming up and saying Hey I want you to
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
do this I mean there that's the and
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's one of these situations
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
that's really hard and I think that's
 
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
when we talk about in our committee
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
we've talked about the training of
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
judges and stuff to really look at this
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
because it is a very challenging
 
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
situation and it is it is a a
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
statistical fact that many abusers if
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
not most will actually say that they've
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
been abused in some way or another and
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's their perception they didn't get
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
their way they didn't get anything else
 
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
so it is a challenge but these are the
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
types of evidences that you're seeing
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
seeing you know this it's kind of a
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
hearsay or it's a breach of HIPPA or
 
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:01.640 align:start position:0%
anything else that they're wanting to
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
have this evidence in and that just you
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
know that has to be up to the judge's
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
discretion and stuff and I I get your
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
point that so somebody's been accused it
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
is hard to prove one way or the other
 
00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:14.839 align:start position:0%
but there are Avenues you know within
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
the rules of evidence that you can
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
actually um do that but it's a matter of
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
being able to you know kind of look that
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
up and see that there are some things
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
you know text messages like text me
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
those can be admitted you know if you
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
have the actual not it has to have like
 
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
the full text message you know that kind
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
of stuff can be admitted um if you have
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
let's say a voicemail from that person
 
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
that can usually be admitted something
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
like that but there are there are
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes some kind of patterns but it
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
can be very challenging in a lot of
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
cases um people if they can will submit
 
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
to you know either psychological tests
 
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
of both parties or personality tests or
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
whatever so it is a challenge but it's
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
also not the the norm it's not the major
 
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
cases character evidence is Rule
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
404 and having read through not only the
 
00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
the uh law but the reporter's notes
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
which gives commentary on case law which
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
is the second level of law um it's it's
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
very nuanced to say the least um to be
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
admissible under evidentiary rule
 
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
governing character evidence two
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
requirements must be satisi satisfied
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
profit evidence must be pertinent that
 
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
is to say it is relevant to this case it
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
must constitute a character trait but
 
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
then there are other times when just
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
because somebody stole in the past
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean they stole this
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
time and it's you know past sexual
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
behavior for example is generally not
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
admissible to prove a particular thing
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
but sometimes it is so that's why on
 
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.150 align:start position:0%
but sometimes it is so that's why on
some

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
cases prosay may not be the way to go
 
00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that's I mean that's Mike sorry
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
that is that is the Dilemma of course
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
and and that's why we do see that
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
certain advocacy groups and stuff will
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
provide legal representation or there's
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know other ways to do that because
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
these These are incredibly complicated
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
and it it's your life on the line it's
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
one of those situations where you know
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
to have people that are actually trained
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
in this that have gone to school for
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
this is is the best option um there are
 
00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:28.839 align:start position:0%
advocacy grp group for that um and some
 
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
people can afford it and they choose not
 
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
to do it anyway so it's it's a
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
dilemma yes
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.270 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman uh
so

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:41.079 align:start position:0%
I I mean my concern I mean we're hearing
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
um uh domestic violence that has
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
actually happened it's the false claims
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
as representative ball says uh that's of
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
concern because now it's your it's your
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
children and I think
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
given a reason uh given a reason has to
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
not let in some character uh positive
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
information um you know give a reason
 
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
and then the judge would have to give a
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
reason especially if they found that
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
um there was a potential for domestic
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
violence you know um you know and that's
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
the issue and and uh I don't know and
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
the must of violence is it an automatic
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh criminal case or they could just be
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
litigated court and
 
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's okay so would a family would a
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
family court say that yes we believe
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
there's been domestic violence they'll
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
they'll make that statement they could
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
they could representative katab and I
 
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
have a meeting with the speaker later
 
00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
this week about a bill she's filed where
 
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases should go
 
00:44:57.309 --> 00:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
because I've heard uh
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
conflicting desires that is
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
automatically they should go to u a
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
criminal court or because they're
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
interwoven with a family court issue
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
they should stay so um that's something
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
that I think some further discussion is
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
going to ensue when representative kab's
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
Bill progresses through yes please so
 
00:45:22.549 --> 00:45:22.559 align:start position:0%
many times those two I've heard a lot of
 
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
discussion in domestic violence by the
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
way these the domestic abuse violence
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
that's kind of um an undercurrent of a
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
lot of what we've been seeing and stuff
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
but on those domestic violence cases you
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
know whether or not it should be you
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
know handled in the family courts
 
00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not should be criminal there
 
00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
are times when there'll be a finding of
 
00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
abuse but the level is not that it's
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
going to push to criminal or maybe it
 
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
was the first time or whatever um those
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
are constantly interwoven and sometimes
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the family courts something gets
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
missed that then when the criminal hits
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
they go back and revisit you know
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
visitation or whatever else but it is it
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
is challenging I could speak from
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
personal experience it is challenging
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at waiting for
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
investigations to happen for the courts
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
but for the family court what they can
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
say is they can look at like DCFS or
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
whatever there'll be investigations
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
there can just be a finding there they
 
00:46:17.069 --> 00:46:17.079 align:start position:0%
turn in the recommendation to the
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
authorities on charges that then have a
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
different perance of evidence but on
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
that first one for the family courts
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at the immediate
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
safety it's much quicker for uh just to
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
say that there was a finding and those
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
are investigated and can those be turned
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
around absolutely but they are done by
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
experts and they're looked at but it is
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
important to have the distinction
 
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
between the two courts and it's
 
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
important to have them in both
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
ball in the case that I observed
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
um with a DV case involved the judge was
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
not taking into to consider evidence
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
unless it was brought up by the person
 
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
who is making allegations so it wasn't
 
00:47:04.829 --> 00:47:04.839 align:start position:0%
so easy to just put in text messages or
 
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
anything um there was no evidence being
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
accepted my concern is that when you're
 
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
accused of DV there is no way um to
 
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:15.559 align:start position:0%
defend yourself if they can't get the
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
evidence in or if they can't question
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
the mental health of the person making
 
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:20.870 align:start position:0%
the mental health of the person making
the

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
allegation um so I I'm just worried it
 
00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:26.839 align:start position:0%
with the bill that there it I just
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
believe it needs to a little bit more
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
work I think that there needs to be some
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
caveats um if there is DV involved I
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
think that there has to be allowed to
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
have evidence brought in um people have
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
the right to defend themselves against
 
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
these are only
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
allegations and from what I'm hearing
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
when police are called to the house
 
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's getting arrested they don't
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
investigate it there they just make an
 
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
arrest and that is the way it is
 
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
happening these days and I I think think
 
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's difficult
 
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
um you say that there's help in the
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
courts there is lots of help in the
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
courts for the person that's going in
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
and claiming domestic violence but I
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
don't see help in the courts for people
 
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
who are accused of it there's no one to
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
walk them through the system to figure
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
out how to defend themselves they're
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
often forced out of their houses they
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
lose all their money they lose access to
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
their children and they need help and I
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
think that comes down to the fors it
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
comes down to education but it ALS also
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
comes down to evidence and they need to
 
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
have the right to present and um
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
evidence in the court so I'm not saying
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
all evidence has to be but I do think
 
00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
when it pertains to the domestic
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
violence um I think it does need to be
 
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to be in the courts does anyone
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
up here has anyone up here read uh
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
violence I'm going to take that as a not
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
no I'm going to take that as a fournos
 
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
one yes I think she's still working on
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
it she's still working and I saw the
 
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
original the reason I'm mentioning that
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
is if we say in general requiring judges
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
to follow strictly Rules of
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
Evidence um is wrong in our opinion
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
might there be a carve out for DV cases
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
and that would be perhaps the subject of
 
00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.510 align:start position:0%
and that would be perhaps the subject of
her

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:38.270 align:start position:0%
her
bill

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative long so my question would
 
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.230 align:start position:0%
representative long so my question would
be

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
um if that were the
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
case would the judge rule on whether
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
there there was a finding that there was
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or there was not
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
does that require this family court
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
judge to rule on
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
that I don't
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
know if it is brought in as evidence and
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
that evidence then is persuasive to the
 
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
judge for the larger question I would
 
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
say he is de facto ruling on it unless
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
argued that he would have or she would
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
have made that finding anyway
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
irrespective I mean it's for that reason
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
where admissible errors um are not
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
appealable if it is ascertained that the
 
00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:44.839 align:start position:0%
verdict would have been the same anyway
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
um how are we doing over there so are
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
you talking about one
 
00:50:48.119 --> 00:50:50.549 align:start position:0%
you talking about one
about

00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
coordinator I'm not quite
 
00:50:54.440 --> 00:51:16.230 align:start position:0%
coordinator I'm not quite
uh

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
but it's certainly something worth
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
exploring somewhere that if we simply
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
keep status quo anti in terms of um
 
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:27.799 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence do not apply in Family
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
Division there may want to be a separate
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
DV because that's where
 
00:51:38.119 --> 00:51:40.270 align:start position:0%
DV because that's where
the

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
subconscious bias on the part of a judge
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh might be more likely and I say
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
subconscious I agree with that chairman
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
Pearson and I I do feel that that is the
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
area of the family court that is being
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
weaponized and that's why we need to
 
00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that everyone has equal access
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
allegations are we ready to start moving
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
to the two different bills before us um
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take 475 because we've been
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
kindly kind of discussing it anyway um
 
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.829 align:start position:0%
kindly kind of discussing it anyway um
and

00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
we have I don't have 475 in front of me
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
but I ALS I do have the amendments in
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
front of
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
me um
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
would somebody like to make a motion on
 
00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.470 align:start position:0%
would somebody like to make a motion on
47

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
47
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
475 so if I may you may um uh the
 
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
amendment I
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
think I correct well actually I was
 
00:52:52.789 --> 00:52:52.799 align:start position:0%
going to because we're recommended to
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
the full committee yeah this is a
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation so I would I would
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
recommend to the full committee that um
 
00:53:03.309 --> 00:53:03.319 align:start position:0%
on Amendment 2023
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
10168 that beginning line8 and nine be
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the full committee if for
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
any reason evidence or testimony is not
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
admitted the reason shall be noted in
 
00:53:13.559 --> 00:53:15.789 align:start position:0%
admitted the reason shall be noted in
the

00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
record so that's not an
 
00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
otpa or itl it is a suggestion which is
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I mean this is a work
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
group and we're working and if you want
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
I could bring that motion forward or I
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
mean I can bring that Amendment for the
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
full committee to uh or would you want
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
to is it the general view of the five of
 
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
us that the
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
lines final bit of line 8 and all of
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
line nine are are
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
good but the rest of the
 
00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:03.030 align:start position:0%
good but the rest of the
bill

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
not you don't have the amendment
 
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
no okay well here's the amendment we've
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
been talking about the very end of line
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
8 and all of line n talking about Judges
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
giving reasons if they rule a certain
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
way that's objected to uh the what's
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
above it is just generally saying they
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
got to follow the rules of evidence and
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
that so we have a suggestion on the
 
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
floor that we bring our conversation
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%

I'll write some language in here to that
effect

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.349 align:start position:0%
effect
um

00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:05.359 --> 00:55:09.549 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:09.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.559 --> 00:55:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
righty

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
and uh where can you get a copy of the
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
amendment well you can if if you very
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
nicely ask um our committee researcher

475 you don't think you have it I have C
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
is there a copy machine is there a copy
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
could we copy
 
00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.950 align:start position:0%
could we copy
it

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
d116 yeah I
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't okay so
 
00:55:57.309 --> 00:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
we representative mcmah says no but I
 
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
believe there's a copier down the hall
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.829 align:start position:0%
 
need

00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think I don't know yeah while
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
you're up I volunteer to get oh okay all
 
00:56:17.029 --> 00:56:17.039 align:start position:0%
right all right all right all right four
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
under under um the next bill here 499

there is an amendment 619 but I list it

actually I got read I wrote on mine so I
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
think it may have been discussed just
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
probably not uh yeah I wrote on it too
 
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%

01:07:08.799 --> 01:07:10.349 align:start position:0%
 
just

01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman uh so I think
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
the first uh the first section uh
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
responded believes will have favorable
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
to his or her case for the record this
 
01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
is amendment 619 to House Bill 499 yeah
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
actually the original um this changes
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
the statute uh it's 169 C12 not uh the
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
490 that was in the original
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
um so that that tells me there are times
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
when respondents will put in evidence
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's not favorable to
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
them I don't know if that's ever the
 
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.029 align:start position:0%
them I don't know if that's ever the
case

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
um okay and then in section two it
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
appears that we I I I think it's going
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
complicated to tell to tell the judge
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
that you shall admit evidence and then
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
say if the judge has reason to believe
 
01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
that appli of rules shall adversely
 
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
affect the
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
case uh he could wave the evidence I
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
think that I think that becomes more of
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
a conflict sets up more of a conflict
 
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
between litigants because now the judge
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
because now you shall admit and then
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's saying however if you
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
believe uh that it'll adversely affect
 
01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.910 align:start position:0%
believe uh that it'll adversely affect
the

01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
case um in other words you do what we
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
tell you except when you don't want to
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
but well exactly I I you know it's it's
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
not it's not clear to me it it opens up
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
for more Arguments for more conflict in
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
my opinion you may remember and I only
 
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
remember because I wrote it down judge
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
headed who was the link from the
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
Judiciary to us at the time saw sections
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
one and two to be contradictory to each
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
other and you agree I agree you
 
01:09:04.669 --> 01:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
agree and and I think uh we're in the
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
other Bill we're addressing
 
01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.950 align:start position:0%
other Bill we're addressing
um

01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
um noting in the
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
file um the rationale for not allowing
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
and I think that's fair yeah in other
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
words here line 15 the judge May wave
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
wave the rules of evidence and shall
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
note in the file the rationale for this
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
decision is very similar to what we just
 
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
saw and what we are going to recommend
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
to the children and family law committee
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.309 --> 01:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
whole so what do we think well
 
01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I representative Greg would you
 
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion on uh Amendment
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
619 H sure I'd like to make a recommend
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh recommend I'd like to make a
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the um full committee
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
um uh now do we have to uh do the bill
 
01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.270 align:start position:0%
um uh now do we have to uh do the bill
as

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
unamended I don't know what to do next
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
well we're a subcommittee so we're
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
really a work group so we could pretty
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
much do what we can do what we want
 
01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
that's right so we recommend the bill
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
and the amendment it out firsted
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
I how about my folks to the right
 
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
here we have a motion on the
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
yes do you like it or you don't like
 
01:11:11.199 --> 01:11:17.070 align:start position:0%
yes do you like it or you don't like
it

01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to say
 
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
okay so and the cheer votes
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
itl um and so that makes the vote 3-2 we
 
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
recommend itl I would be
 
01:11:42.629 --> 01:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
interested um as to why you would say no
 
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
to itl because then you're telling me
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
you like
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
this the issue is what are we doing here
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
in the first place Mr chair and that's
 
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
because you have the judges doing
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
Collective enforcement of what Rules of
 
01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
Evidence are okay now that being said we
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
need when I say we need the system
 
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
should allow the uh as you have clearly
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
pointed out the litigants being given
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to provide their
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
evidence now that being said now it's
 
01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
saying what evidence how it's stated and
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
then adjudicated after it's been
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
submitted that's why for myself this is
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
we not recommending this to the
 
01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
committee to further discuss and this is
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm after that is to have more
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
application discussion on like like the
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
case here where the the judges it's
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
going back to what I believe brought us
 
01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
here in the first place is where judge
 
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
the judge is stating on his own on his
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
or her own whether uh the the rationale
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
for a decision not to not to follow the
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence okay now that's taking
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
place now without it being in Black
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
letter it it's it's just the the
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
Ambiance of the environment not the the
 
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
statement of how you can expect it to
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
perform and it it being in the court so
 
01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
that but that's why it was not for itl I
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
want us to do something versus not uh on
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh on this effort and that's providing
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
voice to the to both on both sides but
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
the judge is still there to have a fair
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
application of acceptance of of of this
 
01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
with a with something written uh for
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
course of rule I guess the reason why I
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
didn't have any trouble killing the
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
amendment SL bill is the idea of the
 
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
judge giving reasons for decision was
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
already discussed and agreed to under
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
499 and that would be um part of what we
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
recommended going forward uh to the
 
01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
whole Committee in other words line 15
 
01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
is fine perfectly fine it pretty much
 
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
replicates line nine in the previous
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment but did I misunderstand Mr
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
chairman you said to it both the
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
amendment and the bill okay now that
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
being said then it's as you stated
 
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
earlier it's moot to use the word in the
 
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
right context and I'm saying for like
 
01:14:10.629 --> 01:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
I'm for what you just stated is that the
 
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
case well then where did that reside
 
01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
because they just said the iil the bill
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
twice I mean twice meaning the bill
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
itself where yeah representative long
 
01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so so in 475 we asking the judge to
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
give a reason why evidence wasn't
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
submitted in 475 the first one we're
 
01:14:33.629 --> 01:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
we're in agreement with that the first
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
the first one so so uh 499 uh replicates
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
that um well actually section um section
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
one uh the only difference there is
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
whatever the respondant believes will be
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
in their in their favor I I don't know
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
if I would put in any evidence that
 
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
would harm me um so I don't know where
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
we need that
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
um I you know they want to put in
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
evidence that is favorable to them so
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's to me a no-brainer I I get that I
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know why you need that
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
in language um and and I think it
 
01:15:15.239 --> 01:15:16.870 align:start position:0%
in language um and and I think it
creates

01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
creates
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
complications um and creates more of a
 
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
conflict down the road so then 80% that
 
01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.669 align:start position:0%
conflict down the road so then 80% that
are

01:15:24.669 --> 01:15:24.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
minimal conflict that has a potential of
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
creating more conflict with that 80%
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
again we're talking about the 10 15% of
 
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
conflict uh cases what would you
 
01:15:42.629 --> 01:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
think if we took House Bill
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
499 as a vehicle and admitted section
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
one Roman one and kept Roman
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
two if the judge has reasons that
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
applying the Rules of
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
Evidence shall adversely affect the case
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
you could have adversely affect the
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
case by having unnecessary further
 
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
amendments I mean further Evidence you
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
could do it by probative value outweigh
 
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
by bmer merching character uh those are
 
01:16:19.149 --> 01:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
reasons why a judge would say no um this
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't Advance the case so if we just
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
took Romans Roman two the court shall
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
apply the Rules of Evidence to enhance
 
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
the predictable orderly fair and
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
reliable presentation of evidence I
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
think that's in the book somewhere if
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
the judge has reason to believe that
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
applying the Rules of Evidence should
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
adversely affect the case the judge May
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
wave The Rules of Evidence and shall
 
01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
note in the file the rationale for the
 
01:16:47.719 --> 01:16:50.870 align:start position:0%
note in the file the rationale for the
decision

01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
two if we had an amendment if I wrote an
 
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
amendment ran it over we all liked it
 
01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
and it says basically rule two the whole
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
bill shall be replaced with just rule
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
two how does that sound yeah I I'm I
 
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
have an issue with uh yeah I would have
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
an issue with that the uh because the
 
01:17:21.629 --> 01:17:21.639 align:start position:0%
judge could only uh the judge could
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
only not
 
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
admit not allow evidence if it adversely
 
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
affects the case so if
 
01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
somebody smeared my character and I
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to submit evidence and the judge
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
is saying I'm not buying that person
 
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
that's smeared evidence on
 
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
you um it's not going to affect
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
adversely affect the case I see but it
 
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
doesch your
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
character right but the judge isn't
 
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
buying it okay you know and that would
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
be um and that would be written down at
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
the end uh decision why I didn't take
 
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
the evidence because the character of
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
the respond of of the character of the
 
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
party uh was not being weighed in they
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
they're you know I didn't I didn't
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
accept that the person
 
01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.629 align:start position:0%
accept that the person
was

01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:18:17.639 --> 01:18:19.990 align:start position:0%
was
whatever

01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
us yeah go ahead excuse me for talking
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
no that's okay with my colleague just
 
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
don't use white out on the screen that's
 
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
all I ask okay um as a freshman I just
 
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
needed some clarification because I'm
 
01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
again a little bit um confused used
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
because this is repealing a different
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
part of the law than 475 they're two
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
separate issues and I just pulled up the
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
part that it's actually saying it would
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
repeal and that's where I was just
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get some
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
clarification um looking at that section
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
law I I could be wrong here that's why I
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
was asking for clarification I guess
 
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking for is something that
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
does not take away the
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
judge's uh
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
discretion but adds if the judge accepts
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
a piece of evidence over an objection or
 
01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
denies a piece of evidence obviously the
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
person profer it would object the
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
reasons must be
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
stated period you like
 
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
sound I
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah well R ball brings up a good
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
point um I I don't know if
 
01:19:59.679 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
point um I I don't know if
uh

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:00.850 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:00.850 --> 01:20:03.669 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
um uh was it 499 that changed the
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
statute 490 to
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.470 align:start position:0%
 
490

01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
490
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
so I mean we would be looking to get
 
01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.870 align:start position:0%
so I mean we would be looking to get
that

01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
language of
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
475 if we were going to go with uh
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
499 I don't know if it needs to go into
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
169 so what I I'm what I'm reading here
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
is the the 169c semicolon 12 that
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
they're talking about
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
um that they're looking to
 
01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:53.350 align:start position:0%
um that they're looking to
repeal

01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.910 align:start position:0%
repeal
is

01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
what is
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
499 so they're looking to repeal that in
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
any hearing under this chapter the court
 
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
shall not be bound by the technical
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence and may admit evidence
 
01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
which considers relevant material
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
evidence of Prior unfounded or founded
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
reports of abuse or neglect shall be
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
admissible in proceedings under this
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
chapter um to establish re relevant
 
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
patterns or course of conduct
 
01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:27.189 align:start position:0%
patterns or course of conduct
I

01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.199 --> 01:21:35.110 align:start position:0%
 
want

01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:40.149 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.159 --> 01:21:46.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay and 409 addresses
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
all okay
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
stat so they go to two different places
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
law if I may yeah thank you Mr chairman
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh so if we put it in 475 IT addresses
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
all 490d addresses all family court
 
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
evidence and
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
499 changing it to 169c just addresses
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh well you be duplicating it just
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
addresses abuse and neglect cases
 
01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.470 align:start position:0%
addresses abuse and neglect cases
169c

01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
169c
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
so we already got it all addressed in
 
01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.870 align:start position:0%
so we already got it all addressed in
475

01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
475
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
475 okay
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
um then try this out take out the
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
amendment 1016 to House Bill
 
01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
um we strike the amendment strikes
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
everything up until just about the end
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
of line eight right and what we add or
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
change it in fact it strikes the whole
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
thing and the an amendment could say if
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
a judge chooses to admit evidence or
 
01:23:39.149 --> 01:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
testimony and one of the litigant
 
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
objects or if a judge chooses to deny
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
profit evidence or
 
01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
testimony the judge shall note in the
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
decision that keeps the them free to use
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
their discretion but if in the admission
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
or denial of testimony or evidence
 
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:03.560 align:start position:0%
somebody objects the judge has to give a
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
reason just as if a litigant objects the
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
Lian has to give a
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
sound yeah I I mean I think the Judge
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
ought to give a reason no matter what I
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
do too um so but then it goes in the
 
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
record and so if you want to collect
 
01:24:26.669 --> 01:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
records and say judge
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
Snodgrass so frequently does such and
 
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
such and gives this cockman reason then
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
somebody could say okay here is a unique
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
base if you I would think if appeals can
 
01:24:53.709 --> 01:24:53.719 align:start position:0%
be made on error of law or accepted
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
process you can't just appeal because
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
you're lost abuse of
 
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
discretion and this might
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
help so I mean thank you we've already
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
established that proos don't object
 
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
because they don't know they could but
 
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
we also now we're saying if they object
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
so if they make a mistake and don't
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
placed uh we've already said that we are
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
going to be talking to the committee as
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
a of of what do we special committee
 
01:25:30.669 --> 01:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
that we want to have a conversation with
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary yeah about all of this
 
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
we've already noted that in here so are
 
01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
are we of agreement that we can take
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
either one of the bills and got it and
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
replace it with the sentence I just
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%

01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy with my itl on 499 and with
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%

it was 14 and 15 starting at the judge
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
or did it include adversely affect the
 
01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.870 align:start position:0%
or did it include adversely affect the
case

01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
your proposed my proposed amendment for
 
01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
475 and you're on 499 right because
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
you're taking the bottom of this to take
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
every everything out of 475 and simply
 
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
replace it with if a judge refuses to
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
admit or does admit and it's subjected
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
to the judge has got to give reason
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
noted in the record uh I'm not offering
 
01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
this now on
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
499 right and
 
01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
right because this the 499 is restricted
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
to abuse and neglect
 
01:33:31.629 --> 01:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
correct that's would apply to all cases
 
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
before Family
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
Court the amendment judge would have to
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
give a reason
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
for the amendment to 475 applies to
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
everything right four um 499 applies
 
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
only to
 
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
169 and as we all know from reading the
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
newspapers the prime sponsor was thick
 
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
addresses so let's take these things uh
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
in order um having put 499 back on the
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
table uh
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
reconsider what do we want to do with
 
01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
499 as it is before
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
us with the amendment
 
01:34:20.189 --> 01:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
yes I didn't think we were amending uh
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
499 I thought we were taking a piece of
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.229 --> 01:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
475 we
 
01:34:29.239 --> 01:34:31.149 align:start position:0%
475 we
ited

01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
ited
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
amendment we reconsidered it we now have
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
to vote we have done legally nothing on
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
499 and again apologies voted 3 to2 to
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
reconsider okay so we can go go back and
 
01:34:52.719 --> 01:34:53.510 align:start position:0%
reconsider okay so we can go go back and
do

01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:34:58.030 --> 01:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
it so on House Bill 499 if I all right
 
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
you may make a motion representative to
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
it all right this is Rev voting which we
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
gave oursel permission to and that is
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative long and do we have a
 
01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
Greg now the motion before us is
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment right now the motion is 499
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
without the amendment yeah yeah if we
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
kill 499 then the amendment is moved
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
right so the the motion before us is
 
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
499 uh I will now call the role and
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%

representative Greg yes representative
McMahon

01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
McMahon
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
ball and
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
um the chair recommends to kill it so
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's back to where we
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
were uh and remember these are only
 
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the committee of the
 
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
whole where we can make our case now um
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
we never voted on
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
475 except to say we all and I'm quoting
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
generally do not favor forcing Judiciary
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
to abide by Rules of Evidence but we do
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
want greater materials to prepare prosay
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
litigant more explanations of how the
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence work during a trial
 
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
and monitoring judges more closely
 
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
especially those who seem to be in the
 
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
extremes for evidence um one way or the
 
01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
other or we also believe a carve out of
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
the blanket discretion Rules of Evidence
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
on domestic violence should be discussed
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
by the special Committee in judiciary
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's our recommendation
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
um do you wish to further encourage me
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
to uh go get an amendment you can walk
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
down there with me if you want to so we
 
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
have one of you know both of us um so
 
01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
that's my question to you do you like
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
475 um amend a new amendment that will
 
01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.390 align:start position:0%
475 um amend a new amendment that will
be

01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:37:18.109 --> 01:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
forthcoming that will read this if a
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
judge chooses to admit evidence or
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and one of the litigant
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
objects or if a judge chooses to deny
 
01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
proferred evidence or testimony the
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
judge shall note in the record the
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
reason for this decision that amendment
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
to be worked on by OS will replace the
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
bill what's your thoughts I think we
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
kind of like that we like that uh well I
 
01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
I um
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
I I think as far as the objection goes
 
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
isn't that
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
current that if a judge jge uh disallows
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
evidence the litigant could object uh
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
because if they appeal they need to be
 
01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:03.159 align:start position:0%
able to bring that to the appeal the
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
litigant May object at that time and
 
01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
must give reason for
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
it right I don't know I don't know if we
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
need to add the ejection part I mean
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
give reason for for it I I agreed like
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
the last sentence in uh the amended
 
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 475
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh actually starting on uh page eight if
 
01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
for any reason evidence or testimony is
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
not admitted the reason shall be noted
 
01:38:33.390 --> 01:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%

counselor it's
you

01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.119 --> 01:39:11.109 align:start position:0%
 
counselor

01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:30.189 align:start position:0%
 
said

01:39:30.189 --> 01:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I I mean I haven't heard testimony
 
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
from anybody saying um I want to know
 
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
why he admitted my testimony no I want
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
to know why he admitted her
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
testimony all right I objected in the
 
01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
yeah now and I gave a reason and I was
 
01:39:49.229 --> 01:39:49.239 align:start position:0%
denied I want to know why specifically
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
have So currently they're not required
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
to give a reason why they're overruling
 
01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.589 align:start position:0%
to give a reason why they're overruling
an

01:40:22.589 --> 01:40:22.599 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
objection they're not required they're
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
not judges aren't required to give a
 
01:40:30.189 --> 01:40:30.199 align:start position:0%
reason why they're overruling and
 
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
objection are they required I would
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.920 --> 01:41:08.629 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
okay so we are not going to make a
 
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
specific uh motion to the committee as a
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
whole on
 
01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
