00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:55.769 align:start position:0%
used it is actually written into the law
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
about the drug forfeiture fund thank you
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
any further discussion of this bill
 
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:13.350 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:18.190 align:start position:0%
yes I wanted to thank the proponents of
 
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
this bill for bringing it the whole
 
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.190 align:start position:0%
issue forward because it didn't turn out
 
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:26.980 align:start position:0%
as we looked at it to it but it was a
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
much more complicated topic than we had
 
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:33.850 align:start position:0%
realized or that I had realized and so I
 
00:11:35.699 --> 00:11:35.709 align:start position:0%
think they certainly performed a great
 
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:39.630 align:start position:0%
service to us to open up an examine
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
small section of state operates
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%

00:12:11.579 --> 00:12:11.589 align:start position:0%

16:27 FN creating an animal records
 
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:10.190 align:start position:0%
database and I want to move but to pass
 
00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:20.829 align:start position:0%
on the bill can I have a second jabbing
 
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.110 align:start position:0%

I would like to move amendment this
 
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:48.670 align:start position:0%
I would like to move amendment this
amendment

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:04.250 align:start position:0%
last night there it is the emember
 
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:08.670 align:start position:0%
dated May 22 because there have been a
 
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:24.330 align:start position:0%
sequence open 12:54 H 2 H P 16 27 FN is
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
there a second Romney is waving his hand
 
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
I think you need to say something can
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
you unmute if you mean to second it
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:02.430 align:start position:0%
okay so if I can speak to my motion the
 
00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
creation of this database is the year's
 
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
highest priority for the Department of
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
Agriculture its limited staffing means
 
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:13.130 align:start position:0%
it has not been able to get copies of
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
vaccination records which are held only
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
at town halls and needed quickly when an
 
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
animal rights person and they would not
 
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:23.850 align:start position:0%
be able to deal with receiving all the
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
health certificates on which health
 
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.130 align:start position:0%
certificates are now required of them
 
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:32.970 align:start position:0%
for various key functions by law the
 
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.030 align:start position:0%
department is run primarily on user fees
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
making it hard to budget for capital
 
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:43.220 align:start position:0%
expenses like creating a new database
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
the bill came two ways and means in our
 
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
capacity as the overseer
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
of dedicated funds it borrows from two
 
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:55.290 align:start position:0%
funds one closely related and one not to
 
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
establish a computerized database for
 
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:01.780 align:start position:0%
all animal health records and
 
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:03.820 align:start position:0%
which may in the future be expanded to
 
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
add other functions these two funds one
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
for animal feeds and scales mostly
 
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:12.370 align:start position:0%
animal feeds and the other for
 
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
integrated pest management accumulated
 
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:17.350 align:start position:0%
surplus is over several years because
 
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:19.630 align:start position:0%
the department did not fully staff the
 
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
functions now fully staffed they do not
 
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:25.300 align:start position:0%
need those surpluses to operate for the
 
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:28.630 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future the database shall be
 
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
developed borrowing funds from these
 
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:33.940 align:start position:0%
surpluses and be maintained over time
 
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:37.180 align:start position:0%
from a new fee of $2 or less on
 
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:39.370 align:start position:0%
certificates of health and rabies
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
vaccinations the department believes
 
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:45.430 align:start position:0%
that the veterinarians current costs of
 
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
time forms and postage exceed this fee
 
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:52.270 align:start position:0%
the committee amendment directs the
 
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:54.850 align:start position:0%
repayment of the donor funds first to
 
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
the integrated pest management which is
 
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:00.730 align:start position:0%
about plants not animals and then to the
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
animal feed fund it specifies the timing
 
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.030 align:start position:0%
and direction of all the transfers at
 
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:09.610 align:start position:0%
the request of the first committee in
 
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:11.710 align:start position:0%
the department it allows customers the
 
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:14.380 align:start position:0%
customers certificate copies also to be
 
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:17.260 align:start position:0%
digital digital so that they would not
 
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
have to receive a paper copy if they do
 
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:22.660 align:start position:0%
not want one
 
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:25.450 align:start position:0%
finally it sends a five year limit after
 
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
the database goes live on transfers to
 
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:30.820 align:start position:0%
avoid any further borrowing between
 
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:36.430 align:start position:0%
funds is them on represent Sam bird has
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
his hand up yes ma'am can you hear me
 
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:45.940 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair I have a different
 
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:49.060 align:start position:0%
opinion on House bill 16:27
 
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:52.750 align:start position:0%
FN the amendment done oh you've done a
 
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:55.630 align:start position:0%
quality job working drafting the
 
00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:57.580 align:start position:0%
amendment for the sponsors and the
 
00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Department of
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
Agriculture if this bill were just about
 
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:03.610 align:start position:0%
raising money through a fee for the
 
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
compiling and administrating of
 
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:08.050 align:start position:0%
certificates of vaccinations for city
 
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:11.410 align:start position:0%
town and clerks to access to an own
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
database that is already operational
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
within the Department of
 
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:17.770 align:start position:0%
culture I would find no objection to
 
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:20.650 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill but I feel that the
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
cart is before the horse this is a
 
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:25.330 align:start position:0%
capital improvement program request that
 
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:27.340 align:start position:0%
I believe should have been first
 
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:28.810 align:start position:0%
submitted through the state's capital
 
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:31.750 align:start position:0%
funding program procedure the proposal
 
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:33.310 align:start position:0%
for this house ways and means committee
 
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:37.180 align:start position:0%
to develop short or long term capital
 
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:39.370 align:start position:0%
expenditures for any department of this
 
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:42.220 align:start position:0%
state I do not believe is this
 
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:44.890 align:start position:0%
committees responsibility this database
 
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:46.750 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Agriculture and
 
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:49.270 align:start position:0%
sponsors want for this record retention
 
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:51.550 align:start position:0%
should be should be shouldered by the
 
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:54.460 align:start position:0%
state's Capital Improvement Fund process
 
00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
not the owners who must get a health
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
certificate rabies vaccination license
 
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:01.810 align:start position:0%
information for pet vendors and etc my
 
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:05.290 align:start position:0%
two basic objections are this bill has
 
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:07.180 align:start position:0%
put the onus upon the House Ways and
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
Means Committee to resolve an
 
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:12.250 align:start position:0%
infrastructure deficiency that should
 
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:14.050 align:start position:0%
have been addressed by the New Hampshire
 
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:15.820 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the Department of
 
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
Agriculture through a State Capital
 
00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:20.470 align:start position:0%
Improvement Fund request state
 
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure requests are more than
 
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.090 align:start position:0%
just roads vehicles and buildings this
 
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.250 align:start position:0%
committee has not been informed or shown
 
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:29.260 align:start position:0%
that a request to move the Department of
 
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:32.620 align:start position:0%
Agriculture into the 21st century was
 
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:35.230 align:start position:0%
initiated and what was the response from
 
00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.030 align:start position:0%
the powers to be if there was such a
 
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:40.660 align:start position:0%
request my second objection is that I
 
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:43.060 align:start position:0%
find great displeasure with the language
 
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:45.130 align:start position:0%
that the Commissioner of the Department
 
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture is not being required to
 
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:50.890 align:start position:0%
reimburse the transferred monies from
 
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:52.990 align:start position:0%
the agricultural product and scale
 
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:55.630 align:start position:0%
testing fund and the integrated pest
 
00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:57.930 align:start position:0%
management fund at the end of five years
 
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:02.890 align:start position:0%
the use of the word may page 2 line 6 of
 
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:05.530 align:start position:0%
the amendment puts no responsibility
 
00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:08.020 align:start position:0%
upon the commissioner to make whole
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
again the agricultural product and scale
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
testing fund or the integrated pest
 
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:16.060 align:start position:0%
management fund by the end of year five
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
and that brings me to this one sub point
 
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:21.490 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner during the public
 
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:25.180 align:start position:0%
hearing also implied other confusing
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
cloudy potential financial disclosures
 
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.130 align:start position:0%
cloudy potential financial disclosures
within

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:29.140 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:31.990 align:start position:0%
the administrating of the department why
 
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:33.790 align:start position:0%
hasn't the Commissioner over the last
 
00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
two year period asked for an audit to
 
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:38.500 align:start position:0%
clear up any confusing financial fund
 
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
estimates with an unclear financial
 
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:42.610 align:start position:0%
picture within the Department of
 
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and not requiring repayment
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
to the agricultural product and scale
 
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:50.950 align:start position:0%
testing fund and the integrated pest
 
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:53.950 align:start position:0%
management fund a Pandora's Box will be
 
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:56.980 align:start position:0%
have been created I find that I cannot
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
support this bill thank you madam chair
 
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:03.250 align:start position:0%
thank you that it is quite a long
 
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
statement and part of it is for the
 
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:13.450 align:start position:0%
guess we can discuss it now
 
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:16.750 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there seems to be nobody
 
00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:23.559 align:start position:0%
in the attendees that is from the
 
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:27.250 align:start position:0%
department or the the Agriculture
 
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
Committee right now if I'm wrong I'd
 
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:34.290 align:start position:0%
like one of them to raise their hands I
 
00:23:37.409 --> 00:23:37.419 align:start position:0%
just offered that if one of them is
 
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
calling by phone the raised hand
 
00:23:43.169 --> 00:23:43.179 align:start position:0%
function is star nine one of them is
 
00:23:46.049 --> 00:23:46.059 align:start position:0%
Club trying to call by phone if that's
 
00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
the case I just saw a number of polymers
 
00:23:54.419 --> 00:23:54.429 align:start position:0%
hmm well while we're waiting to see if
 
00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:56.260 align:start position:0%
we can get I thought that they were
 
00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:00.220 align:start position:0%
going to be here they may have not
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:09.700 align:start position:0%
yes Jess Sanders hasn't stand up and I
 
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:11.470 align:start position:0%
was going to go to him next while we're
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:12.890 align:start position:0%
was going to go to him next while we're
waiting

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:17.470 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and I'm always
 
00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:18.700 align:start position:0%
impressed with the thought that
 
00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:21.549 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg puts into his
 
00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:25.540 align:start position:0%
positions he says a lot in his first
 
00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:28.660 align:start position:0%
point relative to this being a capital
 
00:24:31.409 --> 00:24:31.419 align:start position:0%
investment and that probably should have
 
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:35.710 align:start position:0%
gone through the do ite and all and gosh
 
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:37.660 align:start position:0%
I wish we would have had an opportunity
 
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about that when we were sort of
 
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
talking about the
 
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
amendment face-to-face because it's an
 
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:50.170 align:start position:0%
interesting topic I'm probably still
 
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:53.260 align:start position:0%
going to vote YES for this amendment but
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
I wanted to voice another concern since
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
we were face to face I've had a number
 
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:04.030 align:start position:0%
of people start to share with me their
 
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:07.060 align:start position:0%
very strong concerns about vaccine
 
00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:10.060 align:start position:0%
registries and mandatory vaccines and
 
00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:14.650 align:start position:0%
all of that and I think if I it had an
 
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:18.730 align:start position:0%
opportunity knowing what I know now I
 
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:20.950 align:start position:0%
would have asked for the additional line
 
00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:24.070 align:start position:0%
and the amendment that this IT system
 
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
shall not be used to store any human
 
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:33.670 align:start position:0%
personal health information but that
 
00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:37.150 align:start position:0%
that moment has passed I'm gonna vote
 
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
YES on the amendment YES on the bill but
 
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:43.810 align:start position:0%
I did want to just kind of get it at
 
00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:46.060 align:start position:0%
least on the record with you all that I
 
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
am I'm concerned about these two things
 
00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:56.140 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I'm going to try to
 
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:03.130 align:start position:0%
reach the Commissioner who apparently is
 
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:14.490 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:19.690 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:19.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
in the process of trying to get all of
 
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
this straight I managed I think actually
 
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
I had his cell phone number from when he
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
was was a member of this committee a
 
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:37.970 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:42.030 align:start position:0%
am okay but we are in executive session
 
00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
on 1627 and we've had quite a lot of
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
questions put at us by representative
 
00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:52.470 align:start position:0%
Schamberg and apparently nobody
 
00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
representing agriculture or the
 
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
Agriculture Committee is on yes yeah yes
 
00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:28.170 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Jasper should call in order
 
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
to join this meeting he'll have there's
 
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
a series of numbers I could email the
 
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:37.310 align:start position:0%
the directions to him
 
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:42.570 align:start position:0%
are you in Commissioner Joseph yeah he's
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
in his office so that would work to
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
email them to him
 
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:50.790 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid that representing Schamberg
 
00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:57.330 align:start position:0%
read quite a long statement so I'm not
 
00:27:59.030 --> 00:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
sure if we're going to have to require
 
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:08.850 align:start position:0%
him to repeat it once you're on yeah
 
00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:11.390 align:start position:0%
why don't you get on it now try
 
00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:13.950 align:start position:0%
synthesized them and then he can say if
 
00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:15.750 align:start position:0%
there was something else okay
 
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.210 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you okay
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to I would like to
 
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:32.050 align:start position:0%
just say this agency is
 
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:40.150 align:start position:0%
almost entirely user fees and I believe
 
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:43.900 align:start position:0%
that the problem would be that the user
 
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:46.900 align:start position:0%
fees would have to be raised in order to
 
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:52.060 align:start position:0%
pay for this database and since the
 
00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:56.670 align:start position:0%
database won't be up and running yet
 
00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.030 align:start position:0%
there the money would have to at least
 
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:03.550 align:start position:0%
provisionally be brought in from the
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
general fund to pay for for the the
 
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:16.450 align:start position:0%
capital budget expense reducing the
 
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:18.850 align:start position:0%
amount of money that's available for the
 
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:24.460 align:start position:0%
general expenses of the state and I
 
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:29.650 align:start position:0%
believe that it's in primarily user fees
 
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:33.940 align:start position:0%
because it provides principally for the
 
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:36.730 align:start position:0%
agricultural sector which is lamentably
 
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:40.630 align:start position:0%
a lot smaller than it used to be in the
 
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:48.790 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire but represent
 
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:00.670 align:start position:0%
over Romney and
 
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:03.290 align:start position:0%
just a question for my friend I
 
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:09.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:10.990 align:start position:0%
three issues that you have with the bill
 
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:13.340 align:start position:0%
we've had a couple of work sessions on
 
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:16.310 align:start position:0%
this maybe not on the bill we had a work
 
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:18.290 align:start position:0%
session on it not necessary on this
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
amendment but did you did you bring
 
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:23.510 align:start position:0%
these points up before or is this more
 
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:26.570 align:start position:0%
reflection over time now that you you've
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
concluded these things because you know
 
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
we have we had a work session just the
 
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:32.990 align:start position:0%
other week and how many of these did you
 
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:46.940 align:start position:0%
bring up as issues well yes I'm waiting
 
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
for to be unmuted here okay on March 5th
 
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:54.020 align:start position:0%
appreciate your questions
 
00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:57.250 align:start position:0%
March 5th the Commissioner had made a
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
statement about financial confusion and
 
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:03.740 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how much money
 
00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
there was and I had asked the question
 
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:11.930 align:start position:0%
about the financial figures in the
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
department so it was brought and this
 
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:21.340 align:start position:0%
other position I have taken about the
 
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:26.450 align:start position:0%
being a capital improvement I didn't ask
 
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:29.510 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner that but the more I
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
looked at the bill it is what it's
 
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:33.530 align:start position:0%
becoming as a capital improvement
 
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:36.650 align:start position:0%
program I was just reading my opinion
 
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:39.230 align:start position:0%
here I don't know if it'll change
 
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
anybody's view but I thought I would
 
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:44.930 align:start position:0%
state what my objections to this bill
 
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:50.980 align:start position:0%
are thank you thank you
 
00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:56.690 align:start position:0%
yes I think the Commissioner and we
 
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:00.950 align:start position:0%
still don't seem to have him in they can
 
00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:03.020 align:start position:0%
I cannot remember can anyone remember
 
00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:04.430 align:start position:0%
when the Commissioner became
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Chris Chris do you remember
 
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.130 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.539 --> 00:32:17.549 align:start position:0%
you must've Oh Chris I'm sorry rips of
 
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:19.130 align:start position:0%
all me I didn't hear the question
 
00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:27.299 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner became commissioner he
 
00:32:29.299 --> 00:32:29.309 align:start position:0%
stepped down from speaker to do it I
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
don't he's been there a couple of years
 
00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:39.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:43.529 align:start position:0%
the state certainly before he arrived
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
the state of the finances of the
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
Agriculture Department where were rather
 
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:56.370 align:start position:0%
complicated shall we say and essentially
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
what they've been doing for many years
 
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
is to to try to exist on a minimal very
 
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
minimal amount of money and that means
 
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
sharing staff time over programs it
 
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
means doing without a lot of things the
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
rest of the departments have represented
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
Edwards I see her hello a lot of hands
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:29.539 --> 00:33:29.549 align:start position:0%
you're a muted look I just wanted to
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
answer your question I believe it was
 
00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.060 align:start position:0%
answer your question I believe it was
mmm

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:32.070 align:start position:0%
mmm
 
00:33:36.049 --> 00:33:36.059 align:start position:0%
fairly early in 2019 because we were
 
00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:42.049 align:start position:0%
halfway through the previous term AHA
 
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
and that's the answer to your question I
 
00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:48.330 align:start position:0%
believe and then I just wanted to thank
 
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:51.750 align:start position:0%
representative Shamburger again he said
 
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:54.690 align:start position:0%
it was just his opinions but the opinion
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
on the the capital investment I think
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's just really a great point and maybe
 
00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
we discussed it but it's certainly an
 
00:34:06.139 --> 00:34:06.149 align:start position:0%
important thing for us to be comfortable
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
with so so thank you on representative
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
Tucker's the only one left with a hand
 
00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:19.649 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419 align:start position:0%
I believe that the Commissioner became
 
00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:36.089 align:start position:0%
commissioner in January 2019 sorry this
 
00:34:46.579 --> 00:34:46.589 align:start position:0%
is the Commissioner again hello it's it
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
just came in okay good
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:55.889 align:start position:0%
Thanks okay he just got the email and I
 
00:35:01.279 --> 00:35:01.289 align:start position:0%
represent Tucker I believe the
 
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:02.910 align:start position:0%
Commissioner became commissioner in
 
00:35:09.499 --> 00:35:09.509 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's been about here in three months or
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
less since he was testifying to us on
 
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:24.140 align:start position:0%
the bill between those two times yeah
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
okay so he should be here any minute
 
00:35:31.789 --> 00:35:31.799 align:start position:0%
the RIP rips not follow me I looked it
 
00:35:31.799 --> 00:35:31.970 align:start position:0%
the RIP rips not follow me I looked it
up

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:35:34.819 --> 00:35:34.829 align:start position:0%
um represent jazz excuse me Commissioner
 
00:35:37.999 --> 00:35:38.009 align:start position:0%
Jasper became the Commissioner November
 
00:35:46.359 --> 00:35:46.369 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:49.710 align:start position:0%
you said he became commissioner in
 
00:35:54.229 --> 00:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
November of 17 yep and his term expires
 
00:35:58.779 --> 00:35:58.789 align:start position:0%
in November of 2022 five-year term
 
00:36:05.859 --> 00:36:05.869 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm so that's even further back
 
00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:23.830 align:start position:0%
on upstairs she wants to say something
 
00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:35.380 align:start position:0%
again yes madam chair yes I think it
 
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:36.910 align:start position:0%
caused all this confusion I'm just
 
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:38.860 align:start position:0%
stating my opinion and I thought we
 
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.010 align:start position:0%
would be moving on then to vote on your
 
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:49.690 align:start position:0%
well they've raised several questions
 
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:52.780 align:start position:0%
that I think people want the answers to
 
00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.260 align:start position:0%
that I think people want the answers to
[Music]

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:54.270 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:56.650 align:start position:0%
Commissioner is on the line and he's oh
 
00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:03.450 align:start position:0%
yes good o attendees has gone up but
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
could you let could you just let him you
 
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:09.210 align:start position:0%
ready oh there he is good on
 
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:12.970 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Jasper on the main points
 
00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:16.530 align:start position:0%
that represent of Shambu raised were
 
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:21.130 align:start position:0%
that on this should have gone to a
 
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:23.860 align:start position:0%
request to the capital Budget Committee
 
00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:32.770 align:start position:0%
on first and should include going this
 
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:35.170 align:start position:0%
is from representative Edwards that it
 
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.010 align:start position:0%
should have gone through on on the
 
00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:44.130 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:49.470 align:start position:0%
that on representative Schamberg also
 
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:54.670 align:start position:0%
wants the full repayment to be made by
 
00:37:58.070 --> 00:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the five years and says that
 
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:01.870 align:start position:0%
that you would said yourself that the
 
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:05.860 align:start position:0%
finances of the department are on still
 
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:13.390 align:start position:0%
in disarray and he felt that that this
 
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:17.020 align:start position:0%
ought to be postponed I think in order
 
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:21.580 align:start position:0%
to to get the finances in array and have
 
00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
a chance to talk to the capital budget
 
00:38:30.839 --> 00:38:30.849 align:start position:0%
Kamini okay thank you thank you for the
 
00:38:33.299 --> 00:38:33.309 align:start position:0%
questions I you know we didn't believe
 
00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:35.890 align:start position:0%
that it should go as a capital request
 
00:38:40.979 --> 00:38:40.989 align:start position:0%
because we were able to to self fund it
 
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:42.910 align:start position:0%
and they the likelihood of this
 
00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:45.249 align:start position:0%
competing with all the other capital
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
needs of the state I just I didn't feel
 
00:38:51.199 --> 00:38:51.209 align:start position:0%
that we would have any chance of success
 
00:38:53.849 --> 00:38:53.859 align:start position:0%
given the directives that has have come
 
00:38:56.219 --> 00:38:56.229 align:start position:0%
down so we were trying to do this
 
00:39:01.259 --> 00:39:01.269 align:start position:0%
through creative financing I don't
 
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:04.390 align:start position:0%
believe that I said that the state of
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
the department's finances were in
 
00:39:11.279 --> 00:39:11.289 align:start position:0%
disarray I I think what I what I said
 
00:39:14.809 --> 00:39:14.819 align:start position:0%
was that there seemed to be a lack of
 
00:39:18.569 --> 00:39:18.579 align:start position:0%
balance and one of the accounts but that
 
00:39:20.339 --> 00:39:20.349 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of money there and we
 
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:21.940 align:start position:0%
were working on that I what I told you
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
was that more money was being drawn
 
00:39:27.029 --> 00:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
against that than seemed to be coming in
 
00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:30.430 align:start position:0%
but with the with the staffing that we
 
00:39:32.609 --> 00:39:32.619 align:start position:0%
have been allowed to have that actually
 
00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:35.369 align:start position:0%
is getting better every month but
 
00:39:38.279 --> 00:39:38.289 align:start position:0%
nonetheless in that account and the
 
00:39:40.739 --> 00:39:40.749 align:start position:0%
other account there's plenty of money
 
00:39:41.999 --> 00:39:42.009 align:start position:0%
and the other account is actually
 
00:39:44.459 --> 00:39:44.469 align:start position:0%
building up more quickly than it should
 
00:39:47.489 --> 00:39:47.499 align:start position:0%
be in terms of paying it back in five
 
00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:50.140 align:start position:0%
years the fee would have to be much
 
00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:52.660 align:start position:0%
higher to do that but as I said in the
 
00:39:56.609 --> 00:39:56.619 align:start position:0%
last meeting that you had where I spoke
 
00:39:59.549 --> 00:39:59.559 align:start position:0%
there is a real nexus to the to the pet
 
00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:03.369 align:start position:0%
food part of this and so I'm very
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this fee this money
 
00:40:10.739 --> 00:40:10.749 align:start position:0%
coming out of that that account even if
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
it isn't paid back and that's why I
 
00:40:15.209 --> 00:40:15.219 align:start position:0%
think we talked about the fact that if
 
00:40:17.099 --> 00:40:17.109 align:start position:0%
in fact we had to use any money from the
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
pesticides account that would be paid
 
00:40:24.959 --> 00:40:24.969 align:start position:0%
paid back first but I don't need to take
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
money out of the pesticide fund not sure
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
if that's number two everything so a lot
 
00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:35.430 align:start position:0%
of questions there but yeah have you
 
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
talked to is
 
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:42.140 align:start position:0%
do IT about how you do this yeah yeah we
 
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:45.650 align:start position:0%
have talked to do IT mainly in terms of
 
00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:47.900 align:start position:0%
the security issues on there and the
 
00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:52.059 align:start position:0%
fact that they will be one of the
 
00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:55.700 align:start position:0%
vendors if you will who will be bidding
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
on this in all likelihood although I
 
00:41:00.099 --> 00:41:00.109 align:start position:0%
have to tell you we're we're doing
 
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:02.630 align:start position:0%
another program that was a should have
 
00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:06.890 align:start position:0%
been online last year through do IT and
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
for those of you been around a while if
 
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:11.660 align:start position:0%
you remember when we were changing over
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
the program for the house the system
 
00:41:19.029 --> 00:41:19.039 align:start position:0%
crashed a couple times one right in the
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
middle of vote and that it was described
 
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:25.900 align:start position:0%
as putting a square peg in a round hole
 
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:30.380 align:start position:0%
we are in the same problem with the
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
weights and measures program right now
 
00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:36.890 align:start position:0%
that do IT is actually doing for us it's
 
00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:39.170 align:start position:0%
just not an off-the-shelf program you
 
00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:41.690 align:start position:0%
really for some of these things need to
 
00:41:44.039 --> 00:41:44.049 align:start position:0%
go to a company that is more specialized
 
00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:47.089 align:start position:0%
but do IT is aware of this we've spoken
 
00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:48.470 align:start position:0%
with them about it
 
00:41:51.099 --> 00:41:51.109 align:start position:0%
they'll be taking a look at it once and
 
00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:54.170 align:start position:0%
they'll no doubt will be a critical part
 
00:41:59.380 --> 00:41:59.390 align:start position:0%
of putting together the the request for
 
00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:08.020 align:start position:0%
proposal at that time thank you
 
00:42:13.359 --> 00:42:13.369 align:start position:0%
does do we have anyone who wants to ask
 
00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:20.270 align:start position:0%
further questions or I don't see any
 
00:42:24.789 --> 00:42:24.799 align:start position:0%
hands being raised raised in the
 
00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:30.950 align:start position:0%
committee representative I you have to
 
00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:35.900 align:start position:0%
unmute episode Tucker sorry we have the
 
00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:39.230 align:start position:0%
Commissioner on hand it would be nice to
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
have him have a chance to just give two
 
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:43.910 align:start position:0%
or three sentences of why this is an
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
important project thank you a little way
 
00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:51.490 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:54.530 align:start position:0%
thank you and I had a if I may madam
 
00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
chairman yes yeah I actually had a long
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
conversation with a state senator this
 
00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:04.910 align:start position:0%
weekend about about that and the reality
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
is the legislature has asked us to or
 
00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:12.020 align:start position:0%
instructed us to run this pet bending
 
00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:17.030 align:start position:0%
program and we cannot do it to the
 
00:43:19.569 --> 00:43:19.579 align:start position:0%
extent that we've been asked to without
 
00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:22.790 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of more personnel or without
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
this program and obviously we don't even
 
00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:27.740 align:start position:0%
have the space to house the personnel or
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
the documents that we're being asked to
 
00:43:35.799 --> 00:43:35.809 align:start position:0%
to collect so for the legislature to say
 
00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:38.260 align:start position:0%
that we need to register everyone who is
 
00:43:44.319 --> 00:43:44.329 align:start position:0%
breeding 25 dogs cats ferrets etc not to
 
00:43:46.089 --> 00:43:46.099 align:start position:0%
mention all the fish and everything else
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
in here we have to have this program and
 
00:43:53.319 --> 00:43:53.329 align:start position:0%
as I have been saying right right from
 
00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:55.309 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this it is it's not
 
00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:58.220 align:start position:0%
fair to the department to ask us to do a
 
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:00.980 align:start position:0%
job and then not give us the resources
 
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:04.010 align:start position:0%
to do it in this particular case I
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
didn't ask the legislature to give us
 
00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:10.460 align:start position:0%
the funding to do what you asked us to
 
00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:15.650 align:start position:0%
do I came up with a creative way to fund
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
it with in-house recognizing the
 
00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:21.530 align:start position:0%
limitations of the state finances which
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
of course are much worse now than when
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
this when this started so we've tried to
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
be responsive in all ways to what the
 
00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:32.180 align:start position:0%
legislature has asked us to do but we
 
00:44:35.559 --> 00:44:35.569 align:start position:0%
simply cannot do the job without this
 
00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:39.710 align:start position:0%
program thank you I'd like to add that
 
00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:44.030 align:start position:0%
the pit then the vendor program was
 
00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:50.450 align:start position:0%
inserted by the Senate in to HB 4 you
 
00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:58.250 align:start position:0%
are correct any further questions or
 
00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:03.890 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:06.270 align:start position:0%
you know let's not lose sight of that
 
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:08.010 align:start position:0%
there this is the second coming he bill
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
but the policy we're talking about was
 
00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:12.330 align:start position:0%
approved by I guess the Agriculture
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
Commission and what we're weighing in on
 
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
is we're the guardians of the dedicated
 
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
funds as you mentioned earlier
 
00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative army and all we're doing
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
here is giving an approval to dip into
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
those two funds that's what I thought is
 
00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:30.690 align:start position:0%
it up to this point I think we've all
 
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:33.510 align:start position:0%
agreed that that was okay to do I know
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
this is the final vote but we haven't
 
00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:38.910 align:start position:0%
heard any real negative comments about
 
00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:41.070 align:start position:0%
doing that up to this point
 
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:45.810 align:start position:0%

00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative Griffith with us now who
 
00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:12.020 align:start position:0%

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:40.550 align:start position:0%
there we go I want to tell you I need to
 
00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:43.609 align:start position:0%
leave at about 20 to quarter of an
 
00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:50.270 align:start position:0%
appointment okay we may be able to make
 
00:58:53.079 --> 00:58:53.089 align:start position:0%
that if we go along at the pace we were
 
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
doing before we had to break for the
 
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
executive session quicker we're taking
 
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:09.890 align:start position:0%
the agency numbers but multiplying law
 
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:15.740 align:start position:0%
for two thousand which is one thirty
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
point one and one thirty one point one
 
00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:30.230 align:start position:0%
correct and and all we did on the first
 
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:34.010 align:start position:0%
year is rounded down to 130 and the
 
00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:36.770 align:start position:0%
second year we rounded down to 131 but
 
00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:43.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:47.470 align:start position:0%
commissioner was telling us that total
 
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:50.180 align:start position:0%
spirits I think that's what it's called
 
00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.289 align:start position:0%
spirits I think that's what it's called
is

00:59:52.289 --> 00:59:52.299 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:56.109 --> 00:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
has switched to what a second stage
 
00:59:58.960 --> 00:59:58.970 align:start position:0%
usually is in coming into new territory
 
01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:02.900 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts and raised their prices
 
01:00:05.549 --> 01:00:05.559 align:start position:0%
there so that they are no longer
 
01:00:09.519 --> 01:00:09.529 align:start position:0%
competitive with us in a number of items
 
01:00:12.819 --> 01:00:12.829 align:start position:0%
for the price and we thought that this
 
01:00:16.569 --> 01:00:16.579 align:start position:0%
would probably bring us back some people
 
01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:22.910 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts but we only we went
 
01:00:29.769 --> 01:00:29.779 align:start position:0%
up three percent now as curious why
 
01:00:34.599 --> 01:00:34.609 align:start position:0%
didn't he go up why didn't he go up I
 
01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:40.190 align:start position:0%
think that that he presented this this
 
01:00:45.849 --> 01:00:45.859 align:start position:0%
argument about coming about possibly
 
01:00:48.099 --> 01:00:48.109 align:start position:0%
being able to be more competitive with
 
01:00:53.259 --> 01:00:53.269 align:start position:0%
them again in in the Massachusetts
 
01:00:57.009 --> 01:00:57.019 align:start position:0%
market market but we didn't ask him
 
01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
about whether he would go up be willing
 
01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:01.670 align:start position:0%
to go up because of that
 
01:01:07.809 --> 01:01:07.819 align:start position:0%
on his estimate on it there's also the
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
issue that I believe represented major
 
01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:15.670 align:start position:0%
and I talked about at one point that his
 
01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:22.220 align:start position:0%
his numbers as they are for 21
 
01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:37.730 align:start position:0%
I believe include 2.7 million I didn't
 
01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:42.970 align:start position:0%
think so no no he took he took out the
 
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
2.7 million in the second year for the
 
01:01:51.729 --> 01:01:51.739 align:start position:0%
sale of the property that they could not
 
01:01:54.039 --> 01:01:54.049 align:start position:0%
sell this year but that they have out to
 
01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:01.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:05.030 align:start position:0%
and he believes that the bid there
 
01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:08.210 align:start position:0%
they've been a number of legitimate
 
01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:10.340 align:start position:0%
bidders who looks like they were going
 
01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:12.500 align:start position:0%
to be pretty good and that they'd be
 
01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:14.900 align:start position:0%
able to get their price if they did that
 
01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:17.390 align:start position:0%
then the 131 point
 
01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:24.230 align:start position:0%
one would go up to 133 point 8 in the
 
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
second year and that money represents
 
01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:29.690 align:start position:0%
how much they have to pay on an annual
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
bond that they would be paying off
 
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:34.270 align:start position:0%
enough of the bonds that they could
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
could pay two point seven million less
 
01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:40.310 align:start position:0%
they had originally included in their
 
01:02:42.099 --> 01:02:42.109 align:start position:0%
plan that they were going to be able to
 
01:02:46.089 --> 01:02:46.099 align:start position:0%
make make that sale this year and it
 
01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:51.740 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened that's it's dedicated to
 
01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:01.940 align:start position:0%
the bond payment then it would be yes I
 
01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:04.820 align:start position:0%
could respond to that yes though what
 
01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:06.530 align:start position:0%
they're suggesting to you is because
 
01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:09.740 align:start position:0%
you're in the liquor fund mm-hmm having
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
an expense of 2.7 million you'd have
 
01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:14.450 align:start position:0%
that revenue coming in from the sale
 
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:17.810 align:start position:0%
that would offset what they had earlier
 
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
when they did the budget hit projected
 
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:21.700 align:start position:0%
was gonna be 2.7 million dollars of debt
 
01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:25.580 align:start position:0%
service payments so in a sense you gain
 
01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:30.740 align:start position:0%
that 2.7 in your revenue yes because the
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
revenue that we see is net of all of
 
01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
their expenses correct and and the sale
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
of this of this land was something that
 
01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
was negotiated after or separate from
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
the budget it's kind of outside that
 
01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:46.220 align:start position:0%
process of the revenue estimates that
 
01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:51.710 align:start position:0%
we're done originally and that's correct
 
01:03:56.410 --> 01:03:56.420 align:start position:0%
no I'm okay with that range I'm
 
01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:03.950 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
you know my father call our discussions
 
01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
in our caucus we decided we would go
 
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:13.530 align:start position:0%
back and forth on this one what what to
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
do about 2.7 million is that we said
 
01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:23.490 align:start position:0%
that lets the street has found money if
 
01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:25.410 align:start position:0%
it happens take the more conservative
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
approach because there's still an
 
01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:28.950 align:start position:0%
outside shot that the deal may not
 
01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:34.470 align:start position:0%
happen so that happens happening so so
 
01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:35.790 align:start position:0%
that's why we took the more conservative
 
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
view that's that's correct but we are
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
looking at a range here so I'd like and
 
01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:52.350 align:start position:0%
and there's also the total spirits
 
01:04:59.230 --> 01:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
question on that within the range well
 
01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
it would fit within the range that we
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
so is there anybody else that wants to
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
add something then will will vote for
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
liquor on revenues in 2008 twenty one
 
01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
hundred and thirty million and in FY or
 
01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:43.710 align:start position:0%
do you want to do 0.1 or just leave it
 
01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:48.980 align:start position:0%
at 130 on 130 yeah
 
01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
in FY 2130 million and in FY 21 131 to a
 
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:03.390 align:start position:0%

31 and a high of 134 representative
 
01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:31.710 align:start position:0%

01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
well liquor and the vote being 17 to 0
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
the motion passes for liquor revenues
 
01:09:02.919 --> 01:09:02.929 align:start position:0%
and an FY 20 at 130 million and in FY 21
 
01:09:12.249 --> 01:09:12.259 align:start position:0%
as low of 131 and a high of 134 we've
 
01:09:15.459 --> 01:09:15.469 align:start position:0%
got that put in and the next one is
 
01:09:18.999 --> 01:09:19.009 align:start position:0%
lottery we've managed to group the sin
 
01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:27.710 align:start position:0%
taxes together and we do have somewhat
 
01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:32.980 align:start position:0%
bigger difference but on this one we all
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
take the the lottery commissioners on
 
01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:45.909 align:start position:0%
estimates of 95 for 20 and 100 for 21 on
 
01:09:53.799 --> 01:09:53.809 align:start position:0%
as as the base we on our side have gone
 
01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:55.970 align:start position:0%
up five million to a
 
01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:01.900 align:start position:0%
hundred as the high for fy2010 up ten to
 
01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:11.470 align:start position:0%
110 for FY 21 and it had to do with on
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
Charley McEntire not including in his
 
01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:18.500 align:start position:0%
estimates from what he was saying at any
 
01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:21.710 align:start position:0%
rate the opening sports opportunities
 
01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:25.850 align:start position:0%
that are showing up or the scratch
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
ticket boom which so far is a boomlet we
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:39.050 align:start position:0%
so that's but the sports betting had
 
01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:42.230 align:start position:0%
been pretty much closed down by kovat
 
01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:46.610 align:start position:0%
and they seem to be getting back on
 
01:10:55.810 --> 01:10:55.820 align:start position:0%
their feet again so anyone want to say
 
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:02.210 align:start position:0%
something about about the difference
 
01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:08.450 align:start position:0%
between the highs on those to observe
 
01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:10.450 align:start position:0%
ami reps and the Brahmi has his hand up
 
01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:13.940 align:start position:0%
absent of a Brahmi every time you put up
 
01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:21.860 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet I lose the yeah let's go
 
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:28.330 align:start position:0%
with let's go 21 first so you're hiring
 
01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:33.260 align:start position:0%
assumes that we would get too close to
 
01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:39.260 align:start position:0%
the original plan which I don't know how
 
01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:41.330 align:start position:0%
that's gonna happen I mean I mean sure
 
01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:45.380 align:start position:0%
he's not gonna be open for a while but
 
01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:49.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:51.860 align:start position:0%
restaurants are opening slow we know
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
they're gonna continue to all Bend and
 
01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:00.110 align:start position:0%
that that's the key no money I don't
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
know I don't think we're gonna I don't
 
01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:06.020 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna get up to 110 I mean
 
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
we could probably have something in but
 
01:12:11.949 --> 01:12:11.959 align:start position:0%
for that but now the waiter 110 I don't
 
01:12:14.909 --> 01:12:14.919 align:start position:0%
think so I think we compromised on that
 
01:12:21.699 --> 01:12:21.709 align:start position:0%
and then the else calls make expect the
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
difference but that's my thoughts I just
 
01:12:30.719 --> 01:12:30.729 align:start position:0%
don't know how to get to win tonight and
 
01:12:32.979 --> 01:12:32.989 align:start position:0%
I know what happened to boat like you
 
01:12:36.609 --> 01:12:36.619 align:start position:0%
said and scratch tickets but that could
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
just be a phenomenon of of the colvett
 
01:12:41.379 --> 01:12:41.389 align:start position:0%
situation that we have no explanation
 
01:12:46.319 --> 01:12:46.329 align:start position:0%
for but the tickets aren't selling that
 
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:52.510 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.669 --> 01:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
pretty significant revenue for us so I
 
01:12:59.500 --> 01:12:59.510 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not compromising on this one
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
but if you represent a major would you
 
01:13:10.959 --> 01:13:10.969 align:start position:0%
like to propose something different or
 
01:13:17.859 --> 01:13:17.869 align:start position:0%
comic my comment similar to what Pat I
 
01:13:25.899 --> 01:13:25.909 align:start position:0%
said to compromise somewhat on 21 but
 
01:13:41.129 --> 01:13:41.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
I'd rather stay closer to the 100 I
 
01:13:50.619 --> 01:13:50.629 align:start position:0%
would bring if I put a range on it let
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
me push it like going to 105 to do as
 
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:10.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:17.420 align:start position:0%
something like 95 to 97 yes he did in
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
his report to us say that it's 95 and a
 
01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:30.740 align:start position:0%
hundred but then he says that major
 
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:33.980 align:start position:0%
sports are beginning earlier than we
 
01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:37.580 align:start position:0%
thought will be that that being said a
 
01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
few other factors must be recognized
 
01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:41.900 align:start position:0%
meaning that they aren't in his estimate
 
01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:44.540 align:start position:0%
that major sports will begin prior to
 
01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:48.860 align:start position:0%
September 1 and that Mega Millions
 
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:53.510 align:start position:0%
rolling jackpot is going to you know
 
01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:56.930 align:start position:0%
significant revenues if it continues to
 
01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:00.950 align:start position:0%
roll I don't follow it so I don't know
 
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:06.290 align:start position:0%
and the this boomlet in scratch tickets
 
01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:10.220 align:start position:0%
which are usually very predictable but
 
01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:14.060 align:start position:0%
of course we that would be showing up
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
this year but in next and next month's
 
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.200 align:start position:0%
this year but in next and next month's
revenues

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:20.210 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know Chris do you know what the
 
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:35.510 align:start position:0%
end of May is for lottery their number
 
01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:37.190 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have changed from what you saw
 
01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:06.770 align:start position:0%
earlier in the dailies right yeah so I
 
01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:09.850 align:start position:0%
just wanted to weigh in in support of a
 
01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:14.590 align:start position:0%
compromise that's been suggested so I
 
01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:21.850 align:start position:0%
believe 95 to 97 as a range in 2020 and
 
01:16:21.850 --> 01:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
believe 95 to 97 as a range in 2020 and
102

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:23.590 align:start position:0%
102
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
105 and 21 seems reasonable to me okay
 
01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
I'm reps I've Tucker Tucker immunity
 
01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:45.860 align:start position:0%
yeah so it seems very reasonable to me I
 
01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:50.830 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.230 --> 01:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
all right is there any further
 
01:16:59.650 --> 01:16:59.660 align:start position:0%
discussion then the clerk will call the
 
01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
discussion then the clerk will call the
roll

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:00.490 align:start position:0%
roll
 
01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:09.020 align:start position:0%
on lottery revenues FY 2000 of 95 high
 
01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:24.910 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:31.750 align:start position:0%
representative Ames yes
 
01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:36.070 align:start position:0%
% of Carrick yes
 
01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:39.940 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth yeah
 
01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:49.530 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.530 --> 01:17:50.970 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:50.980 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
so one muted Tucker yes
 
01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:09.210 align:start position:0%
scented bunker I didn't hear response
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
yes yes presented Griffith instead of
 
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:28.050 align:start position:0%
string of me yes
 
01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:33.070 align:start position:0%
is that a major yes was that of Griffin
 
01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:37.650 align:start position:0%
yeah comes end of all already yes
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
presented a bra me yes
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sending Lang presented to set yes
 
01:18:55.419 --> 01:18:55.429 align:start position:0%
his end of Edwards yes incentive
 
01:19:03.929 --> 01:19:03.939 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
17 yes zero knows and to not voting
 
01:19:14.770 --> 01:19:14.780 align:start position:0%
thank you the movie 17 to Cyrano the
 
01:19:21.330 --> 01:19:21.340 align:start position:0%
motion for on lottery revenues in FY
 
01:19:30.729 --> 01:19:30.739 align:start position:0%
2006 95 hi 97 and in 21 low of a hundred
 
01:19:34.719 --> 01:19:34.729 align:start position:0%
high of a hundred and five passes and
 
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:42.010 align:start position:0%
had been put into the lottery column now
 
01:19:47.739 --> 01:19:47.749 align:start position:0%
now we've finished with with the regular
 
01:19:50.429 --> 01:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet for the general fund and the
 
01:19:54.909 --> 01:19:54.919 align:start position:0%
Education Trust Fund the total numbers
 
01:20:02.290 --> 01:20:02.300 align:start position:0%
that we've got seem to be two billion
 
01:20:07.319 --> 01:20:07.329 align:start position:0%
four hundred and twenty seven million
 
01:20:16.029 --> 01:20:16.039 align:start position:0%
point three to two million five hundred
 
01:20:23.369 --> 01:20:23.379 align:start position:0%
and one million point three in twenty
 
01:20:31.330 --> 01:20:31.340 align:start position:0%
and in 21 two million two hundred and
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
sixty one low to two billion four
 
01:20:43.199 --> 01:20:43.209 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.279 --> 01:20:48.289 align:start position:0%
and it's really nice to be able for all
 
01:20:52.689 --> 01:20:52.699 align:start position:0%
of us to see those before it gets turned
 
01:20:59.780 --> 01:20:59.790 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:04.750 align:start position:0%
so I hope we can continue to do this
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
once we get back to meeting in person
 
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
again then we have the highway fund Oh
 
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:18.370 align:start position:0%
should we take we can take a vote on the
 
01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:25.210 align:start position:0%
whole thing in the end right so you got
 
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
rips of majors hand is up and represent
 
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:30.130 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry his hands are up
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
I lose the hands every time you put up a
 
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
split screen and forget to put them back
 
01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:41.830 align:start position:0%
major Chris you'll send you email these
 
01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:46.060 align:start position:0%
sheets to us yeah absolutely so good so
 
01:21:49.650 --> 01:21:49.660 align:start position:0%
when you're done your work today I will
 
01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:52.690 align:start position:0%
make these available to everybody on the
 
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
committee I'll send them out to you all
 
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:57.010 align:start position:0%
and I can also send the excel sheet as
 
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
well you know on make it available
 
01:22:11.150 --> 01:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:17.410 align:start position:0%
I had a comment I'm just thrilled that
 
01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:21.630 align:start position:0%
the ways and means remained able to
 
01:22:25.290 --> 01:22:25.300 align:start position:0%
negotiate and be bipartisan I attributed
 
01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:28.230 align:start position:0%
that a lot to our Chairman and
 
01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:30.070 align:start position:0%
representative pager getting together
 
01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:34.690 align:start position:0%
and others but really it's a great thing
 
01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:38.830 align:start position:0%
when you see so many other units of
 
01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:42.100 align:start position:0%
government unable to even be civil to
 
01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:46.110 align:start position:0%
each other much less work together and
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
the organization that went into this
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
meeting between the staffs and the
 
01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:54.460 align:start position:0%
leadership really is outstanding and I
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
just wanted to comment on that before we
 
01:22:59.090 --> 01:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
log down into Fish and Game and
 
01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:03.190 align:start position:0%
transportation I don't think will bog
 
01:23:03.190 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
transportation I don't think will bog
down

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:06.010 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.730 --> 01:23:08.740 align:start position:0%
I want to write to the end to thank they
 
01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:14.290 align:start position:0%
will just so we don't lose any more
 
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:21.010 align:start position:0%
people before we go Highway worksheet if
 
01:23:35.970 --> 01:23:35.980 align:start position:0%
we can get to that we have I wanted to
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:50.590 align:start position:0%
it can be added in if we want to motor
 
01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:56.550 align:start position:0%
vehicle fees that sounds good with me
 
01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:08.070 align:start position:0%
yes so so the first one is the road toll
 
01:24:15.170 --> 01:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
which is the largest single source that
 
01:24:20.190 --> 01:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
that was put in by the agency as a
 
01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:24.730 align:start position:0%
hundred fourteen point seven for 2020
 
01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:29.110 align:start position:0%
and the Republicans and the Democrats
 
01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
went from a range of a hundred and
 
01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:35.230 align:start position:0%
fifteen which is a hundred and fourteen
 
01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:38.290 align:start position:0%
point seven rounded to a hundred and
 
01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:44.190 align:start position:0%
seventeen very small range for 2020 and
 
01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:53.650 align:start position:0%
in FY 21 the agency 115 point six and
 
01:24:58.140 --> 01:24:58.150 align:start position:0%
the Republicans mirrored it and the
 
01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:03.310 align:start position:0%
Democrats raised it to 118 low and a
 
01:25:09.810 --> 01:25:09.820 align:start position:0%
hundred and twenty-five I now I believe
 
01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:14.170 align:start position:0%
that basically we did that because every
 
01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:16.750 align:start position:0%
day that we go out on the roads now we
 
01:25:18.690 --> 01:25:18.700 align:start position:0%
see more and more cars
 
01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:21.190 align:start position:0%
getting back on the roads those cars on
 
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
the highways and cars in our local areas
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
and and it does seem that the opening
 
01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:37.390 align:start position:0%
for in terms at least of driving to the
 
01:25:41.850 --> 01:25:41.860 align:start position:0%
supermarket and driving out to a piece
 
01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:45.220 align:start position:0%
of country where you can calm down a
 
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
little bit and be be isolated but but I
 
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
in nature is expanding a fair amount the
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
parks are having trouble with too many
 
01:26:00.090 --> 01:26:00.100 align:start position:0%
people trying to come in in some places
 
01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
at least and we also think that it will
 
01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:15.790 align:start position:0%
will increase a lot faster on the basis
 
01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:21.850 align:start position:0%
of that but not too to the original
 
01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:26.850 align:start position:0%
level that the highway fund had been
 
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
expected to reach of a hundred and
 
01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:36.090 align:start position:0%
thirty-two but about halfway up to that
 
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
beautiful during during the year quicker
 
01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:49.210 align:start position:0%
than it shows and the especially in the
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
second half of the year that day of the
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
term the fiscal year the first part of
 
01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:00.830 align:start position:0%
term the fiscal year the first part of
2021

01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
then it shows in their monthly revenue
 
01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:14.620 align:start position:0%
numbers that we were all sent but we
 
01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:22.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.630 --> 01:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
I took those numbers I took those
 
01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:37.070 align:start position:0%
numbers manually into a Excel
 
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:40.010 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet I hope in the future we can
 
01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:43.510 align:start position:0%
get these things not in the PDF but
 
01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
we've never had these before so we have
 
01:27:52.570 --> 01:27:52.580 align:start position:0%
no historical review of how much they
 
01:27:56.770 --> 01:27:56.780 align:start position:0%
differ from months to months and what
 
01:28:02.970 --> 01:28:02.980 align:start position:0%
they've done with that but we have
 
01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:08.690 align:start position:0%
through April at least what this is in a
 
01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
much more detail than we can get when
 
01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:15.650 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a chart in the back of
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
the revenue focus and the july to
 
01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:26.870 align:start position:0%
february road toll average for 2020 that
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
is july 19 to February 20 was 10.8 $7
 
01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:55.630 align:start position:0%
million dollars per month 37 which is a
 
01:28:58.210 --> 01:28:58.220 align:start position:0%
little bit higher than the official plan
 
01:29:01.930 --> 01:29:01.940 align:start position:0%
was for this year but this is not a
 
01:29:08.890 --> 01:29:08.900 align:start position:0%
normal year and and in March the numbers
 
01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:12.830 align:start position:0%
started to go down and in April they
 
01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
were down a fair amount but we're all
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot more people in May coming
 
01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:20.150 align:start position:0%
back on the roads not anywhere near
 
01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:24.710 align:start position:0%
natural normal yet but enough so that we
 
01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:30.230 align:start position:0%
felt we could go up to at least a
 
01:29:33.170 --> 01:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventeen on that
 
01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:42.690 align:start position:0%
by the end of this year and road toll 21
 
01:29:48.930 --> 01:29:48.940 align:start position:0%
what there she shows us is that they do
 
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:54.490 align:start position:0%
not expect to see normality in the road
 
01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:57.310 align:start position:0%
toll until June of next year
 
01:29:59.670 --> 01:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
and before that it will be varying up
 
01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:03.100 align:start position:0%
and down as the months do but the
 
01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:08.410 align:start position:0%
average from June to may July - July 22
 
01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:13.870 align:start position:0%
May 21 for Road toll they have as an
 
01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:20.610 align:start position:0%
average of 1.3 million dollars lower
 
01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:24.610 align:start position:0%
than the average then we had before
 
01:30:37.650 --> 01:30:37.660 align:start position:0%
coated this year and so so that Apple is
 
01:30:41.610 --> 01:30:41.620 align:start position:0%
I only did these numbers after we had
 
01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:47.670 align:start position:0%
our caucus but we'd we'd done a a on
 
01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:53.350 align:start position:0%
view of it just generally by eye during
 
01:30:55.770 --> 01:30:55.780 align:start position:0%
the caucus and had decided to put the
 
01:30:58.620 --> 01:30:58.630 align:start position:0%
numbers up a little for the first year
 
01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:04.470 align:start position:0%
and and then up more in the second year
 
01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:08.950 align:start position:0%
then then the ten ten million more
 
01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:14.430 align:start position:0%
almost and then the second year estimate
 
01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:18.870 align:start position:0%
because unless we have a major
 
01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:22.950 align:start position:0%
recurrence resurgence of the virus
 
01:31:25.710 --> 01:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
almost equal to what we had this time
 
01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:31.060 align:start position:0%
the traffic should continue reps involve
 
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:33.130 align:start position:0%
me you've got three questions rips
 
01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:35.170 align:start position:0%
himself yes Graham Center Southwest
 
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
first thank you yes thank you madam
 
01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:44.170 align:start position:0%
chair and I remember the discussion in
 
01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:47.260 align:start position:0%
caucus as I sit here today
 
01:31:49.530 --> 01:31:49.540 align:start position:0%
I find I'm leaning a lot more towards
 
01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:51.610 align:start position:0%
the agency estimate
 
01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:54.550 align:start position:0%
I think the tolls will probably drop at
 
01:31:57.690 --> 01:31:57.700 align:start position:0%
least 10% because just in talking with
 
01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:02.470 align:start position:0%
people I think there'll be less trips by
 
01:32:04.410 --> 01:32:04.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents I think people
 
01:32:06.690 --> 01:32:06.700 align:start position:0%
just are feeling they need to stay put
 
01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:09.940 align:start position:0%
really for a while I also think they're
 
01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:12.730 align:start position:0%
going to be certainly less tourists so
 
01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:15.460 align:start position:0%
when I look at that 1:32 and plan I
 
01:32:18.570 --> 01:32:18.580 align:start position:0%
think it may drop at least 10% at least
 
01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:20.350 align:start position:0%
for one year it's kind of where I'm
 
01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
leaning at this moment okay so maybe
 
01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:32.050 align:start position:0%
slightly higher than the agency estimate
 
01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:33.400 align:start position:0%
but not by much
 
01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:35.350 align:start position:0%
I just think I'm just hearing from
 
01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:37.510 align:start position:0%
people that they're really changing some
 
01:32:42.450 --> 01:32:42.460 align:start position:0%
of their plans these are for longer
 
01:32:46.170 --> 01:32:46.180 align:start position:0%
trips yes or even do short trips not as
 
01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
often people are talking about not going
 
01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:51.790 align:start position:0%
to the beach as much or you know
 
01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:53.170 align:start position:0%
different things like that it's just
 
01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:57.370 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing okay
 
01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:00.130 align:start position:0%
and it may be different in different
 
01:33:02.850 --> 01:33:02.860 align:start position:0%
parts of the state because definitely in
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
our part of the state
 
01:33:07.710 --> 01:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
we've got more traffic there is more but
 
01:33:10.250 --> 01:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
I still think it might be 10% less than
 
01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
the original well that's 10% for June if
 
01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:23.890 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 2020 no I was
 
01:33:31.410 --> 01:33:31.420 align:start position:0%
talking about 2021 oh okay okay so 10%
 
01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:41.610 align:start position:0%
less would be 13 from 1:30 to around 118
 
01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
less would be 13 from 1:30 to around 118
118

01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:50.110 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
and then Lexus
 
01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:00.380 align:start position:0%
absitively Brahmi and all I can tell you
 
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:06.290 align:start position:0%
is that you lost and half the license
 
01:34:08.170 --> 01:34:08.180 align:start position:0%
plates were from Massachusetts in Maine
 
01:34:11.650 --> 01:34:11.660 align:start position:0%
most in Massachusetts so things are
 
01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:28.330 align:start position:0%
picking up yes hand up next
 
01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:34.220 align:start position:0%
okay Webb said major thank you you gotta
 
01:34:38.670 --> 01:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
remember that the agency came up with
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
114 million dollars for FY 21 about
 
01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:48.710 align:start position:0%
three and a half months of reduce gas
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
taxes mm-hmm and then looking at 2021
 
01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have reduced gas taxes
 
01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:03.530 align:start position:0%
maybe not at the rate that we had in
 
01:35:08.110 --> 01:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
April or May but it's going to be over a
 
01:35:14.110 --> 01:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
period of a whole year and my feeling is
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
that we need to take down 532 by at
 
01:35:28.810 --> 01:35:28.820 align:start position:0%
least 11% such as what the agency and I
 
01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:36.230 align:start position:0%
think they did that job while 11% would
 
01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:43.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.110 --> 01:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
14.5 I guess but that the agency took it
 
01:35:54.730 --> 01:35:54.740 align:start position:0%
down further than that yeah 15.6 is not
 
01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:09.850 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:23.020 align:start position:0%
170 117 point point 7 I think 6 whatever
 
01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:29.810 align:start position:0%
you're getting down to the range and I
 
01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:35.630 align:start position:0%
think that this will blow up if we don't
 
01:36:39.010 --> 01:36:39.020 align:start position:0%
come back and a steady stream if we we
 
01:36:42.250 --> 01:36:42.260 align:start position:0%
have disruptions a second wave or third
 
01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:46.610 align:start position:0%
wave doesn't get worse because now we're
 
01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with a whole year who has the
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
reduce travel rather than just and then
 
01:36:55.570 --> 01:36:55.580 align:start position:0%
you have to figure it's always like
 
01:36:58.060 --> 01:36:58.070 align:start position:0%
about a month behind so it's really two
 
01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:05.210 align:start position:0%
and a half months or so so I think you
 
01:37:12.010 --> 01:37:12.020 align:start position:0%
gotta be careful ok people in other
 
01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:17.180 align:start position:0%
parts of the state Reps and berstein has
 
01:37:19.330 --> 01:37:19.340 align:start position:0%
his hands up reps involve me oh oh yes
 
01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:23.150 align:start position:0%
I'm sad bursting thank you actually I
 
01:37:24.610 --> 01:37:24.620 align:start position:0%
just want to relay a message from
 
01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:27.230 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards his home network
 
01:37:35.490 --> 01:37:35.500 align:start position:0%
fresh rejoin us I didn't hear that
 
01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:38.870 align:start position:0%
website of Edwards home network crashed
 
01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:45.350 align:start position:0%
and he's trying to get back all so I'm
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if people who are having
 
01:37:50.290 --> 01:37:50.300 align:start position:0%
different experiences in different parts
 
01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:55.830 align:start position:0%
of the state because we're getting
 
01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:02.610 align:start position:0%
to the point where were the Bell I'd say
 
01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:06.390 align:start position:0%
70 percent normal at this point in our
 
01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:09.750 align:start position:0%
traffic and it came back really quickly
 
01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:13.710 align:start position:0%
in this in this month in May in last
 
01:38:24.130 --> 01:38:24.140 align:start position:0%
month 70 percent versus that's that's
 
01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:27.390 align:start position:0%
one month looking at it but you might
 
01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:40.230 align:start position:0%
have a reduction and over time will you
 
01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:43.230 align:start position:0%
think that it will stay once it starts
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
to come back it will plant Oh again I am
 
01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:51.270 align:start position:0%
hopeful that it doesn't exceed 11
 
01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
percent total for the whole year we know
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
that coming into ROM now was about
 
01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:02.190 align:start position:0%
thirty five percent at the toll gates 40
 
01:39:07.210 --> 01:39:07.220 align:start position:0%
percent toll gates the toll gates were
 
01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:14.550 align:start position:0%
less last week they were down to 37
 
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
percent loss I think it was no it was
 
01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:20.550 align:start position:0%
come it was falling dead the loss was
 
01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:23.130 align:start position:0%
falling down considerably from one week
 
01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:25.890 align:start position:0%
to the next for a couple of weeks the
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
protection I don't know what this
 
01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:31.770 align:start position:0%
weekend was if it takes a year to fall
 
01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:36.330 align:start position:0%
only 5% you take the average over the
 
01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
year and it's gonna be overall of nickel
 
01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:43.050 align:start position:0%
size but it doesn't it didn't take a
 
01:39:49.630 --> 01:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
year to fall fibers anyway okay it fell
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
dramatically like a step function yeah
 
01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:55.650 align:start position:0%
right but I mean the loss has been
 
01:39:58.580 --> 01:39:58.590 align:start position:0%
falling considerably in one week to the
 
01:39:58.590 --> 01:39:59.030 align:start position:0%
falling considerably in one week to the
next

01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:01.830 align:start position:0%
each weekends tolls it's not gonna come
 
01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:06.990 align:start position:0%
back as a step function yeah yeah okay
 
01:40:10.810 --> 01:40:10.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:15.770 --> 01:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
yes I think the whole tourism part of
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
the economy is going to be affected all
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
summer and fall thank you things are
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
being canceled in a big way our fishing
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
game Department is asked the White
 
01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:30.810 align:start position:0%
Mountain National Forest not to open up
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
Tuckerman Ravine for example or annex
 
01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:36.530 align:start position:0%
for two weeks because they're afraid of
 
01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:40.790 align:start position:0%
injuries that might drain their staff
 
01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:45.450 align:start position:0%
and all kinds of things are still being
 
01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
canceled I need a what they're talking
 
01:40:53.450 --> 01:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
about canceling almost all their events
 
01:40:57.130 --> 01:40:57.140 align:start position:0%
and hikes organized hikes for the summer
 
01:41:00.710 --> 01:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
and people aren't playing to come who
 
01:41:02.690 --> 01:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
usually come here for two weeks two
 
01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:06.090 align:start position:0%
months so I think we're going to see
 
01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:08.430 align:start position:0%
really substantial change in each
 
01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
segment of the state represent a Maui
 
01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:19.950 align:start position:0%
commerce team no Swami I've said
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
bursting had his hand up thank you I'm
 
01:41:26.210 --> 01:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
sure I can to agree with all these
 
01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:28.410 align:start position:0%
comments I would considered New
 
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:32.010 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fortunate if we only eroded
 
01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:34.530 align:start position:0%
10% next year I think representative
 
01:41:36.530 --> 01:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
Southworth gave the number 10 percent
 
01:41:40.190 --> 01:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
but presented a major 11 percent if at
 
01:41:43.010 --> 01:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
the end of fiscal 2021 but that's where
 
01:41:47.570 --> 01:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
we are not only we have their tourism
 
01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
concerns but there's been such
 
01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:52.110 align:start position:0%
dislocation to the economy it makes
 
01:41:55.730 --> 01:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
sense that we're going to see that's
 
01:41:58.190 --> 01:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
less traffic look at our unemployment
 
01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
rate right now to me at a minimum
 
01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
percent to go maybe 15 but I think
 
01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:15.990 align:start position:0%
that's that's the range I'm working in
 
01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:35.010 align:start position:0%
my only comment okay on so next year
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking if we're talking about 10
 
01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:53.190 align:start position:0%
percent or talking at one 13.2 off of
 
01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:09.170 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:13.410 align:start position:0%
we can make that the midpoint the 119
 
01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:15.650 align:start position:0%
make that the midpoint
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
range and I think I think that would
 
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:22.010 align:start position:0%
solve the problem
 
01:43:33.610 --> 01:43:33.620 align:start position:0%
would that be acceptable to others and
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.960 --> 01:43:58.970 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:44:05.150 --> 01:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
it could 116 to 122 would be three in
 
01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:07.470 align:start position:0%
either direction of that Yeah right I
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.490 --> 01:44:18.500 align:start position:0%
and is that acceptable on to people
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
because it starts above
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't start above the rounded
 
01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:29.690 align:start position:0%
number for the the highway people the
 
01:44:33.870 --> 01:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
safety people so what you're saying is
 
01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:46.970 align:start position:0%
21 would be 116 to 123 22 say it again
 
01:45:02.290 --> 01:45:02.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:05.449 --> 01:45:05.459 align:start position:0%
my my ever thought as I look at that now
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe bring it down a million each
 
01:45:14.569 --> 01:45:14.579 align:start position:0%
maybe 115 to 120 long something like
 
01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:23.090 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.509 --> 01:45:26.519 align:start position:0%
yes I feel better with the 115 to 120
 
01:45:44.979 --> 01:45:44.989 align:start position:0%
one and this year could we say 114 to
 
01:45:53.299 --> 01:45:53.309 align:start position:0%
116 or why not what do people want why
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
not I thought their beam is lower than
 
01:46:02.719 --> 01:46:02.729 align:start position:0%
theirs and ours yeah it is no 115 why
 
01:46:13.419 --> 01:46:13.429 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.969 --> 01:46:19.979 align:start position:0%
any further thoughts then the clerk will
 
01:46:26.239 --> 01:46:26.249 align:start position:0%
call the roll for road tolls from the
 
01:46:32.929 --> 01:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
for the highway fund on in FY 2100 and
 
01:46:41.419 --> 01:46:41.429 align:start position:0%
15 million in FY 21 115 low 221 high 121
 
01:46:41.429 --> 01:46:48.910 align:start position:0%
15 million in FY 21 115 low 221 high 121
high

01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:52.770 align:start position:0%
this is for the road toll of the highway
 
01:47:06.290 --> 01:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
fund I represented names yes kind of
 
01:47:08.290 --> 01:47:08.300 align:start position:0%
caring yes
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%

obscenity of Tucker yes any bunker yes
 
01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:30.630 align:start position:0%
zennith demarlo oh I think she had to
 
01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
leave you forever it's me representative
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
Griffith mmm
 
01:47:50.290 --> 01:47:50.300 align:start position:0%
stirring him yes that have major yes
 
01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:54.810 align:start position:0%

01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
reading yes presenter of a bra me
 
01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:06.389 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lang representative
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
representative set symmetry said it
 
01:48:19.089 --> 01:48:19.099 align:start position:0%
looks like he's here and he's unmuted so
 
01:48:23.759 --> 01:48:23.769 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards yes represented
 
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.819 --> 01:48:42.829 align:start position:0%
what is fifteen yes no nose and for not
 
01:48:47.439 --> 01:48:47.449 align:start position:0%
voting thank you the vote being 15 to
 
01:48:52.330 --> 01:48:52.340 align:start position:0%
zero the emotion for road toll and the
 
01:48:59.859 --> 01:48:59.869 align:start position:0%
highway fund FY 2150 115 million and FY
 
01:49:03.850 --> 01:49:03.860 align:start position:0%
21 a range from 115 to 120 1 million
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
passes on we now have the only other
 
01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:19.030 align:start position:0%
fees ranges in in the highway fund
 
01:49:23.979 --> 01:49:23.989 align:start position:0%
grouped as motor vehicle fees they
 
01:49:30.029 --> 01:49:30.039 align:start position:0%
mostly are motor vehicle fees there's no
 
01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:36.110 align:start position:0%
money that came in from sales or planned
 
01:49:41.279 --> 01:49:41.289 align:start position:0%
for next year of sales of vehicles so
 
01:49:45.819 --> 01:49:45.829 align:start position:0%
the department had estimated that we
 
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
would end 20 with on with motor vehicle
 
01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:01.550 align:start position:0%
fees up to 124 point seven and we the
 
01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:05.150 align:start position:0%
Democrats had looked at that and I hope
 
01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:08.090 align:start position:0%
someone else remembers our arguments for
 
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
this I can't find any papers that deal
 
01:50:15.399 --> 01:50:15.409 align:start position:0%
with this problem it's probably written
 
01:50:21.879 --> 01:50:21.889 align:start position:0%
on one of our documents but we thought
 
01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:25.130 align:start position:0%
that it was likely to come in lower than
 
01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:27.500 align:start position:0%
this probably we
 
01:50:31.590 --> 01:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
had a low of 115 million and a high of
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
125 million in on 21 the department had
 
01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:47.650 align:start position:0%
a number of 119 point three million and
 
01:50:50.650 --> 01:50:50.660 align:start position:0%
the Democrats looked at it and thought
 
01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:55.450 align:start position:0%
that it might go as low as 118 and up to
 
01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:00.710 align:start position:0%
123 so focusing around a million more
 
01:51:07.090 --> 01:51:07.100 align:start position:0%
than then they were saying we do know
 
01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:12.590 align:start position:0%
that the motor vehicle fees go down next
 
01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:16.510 align:start position:0%
year about five million I think because
 
01:51:22.350 --> 01:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
we're in the fifth year next year of a
 
01:51:24.610 --> 01:51:24.620 align:start position:0%
transformation that's been going on for
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
two decades now I think in which we went
 
01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
from a four year license to a five year
 
01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:35.450 align:start position:0%
license and the fifth year drops off so
 
01:51:40.410 --> 01:51:40.420 align:start position:0%
I need to get back my participant list
 
01:51:46.810 --> 01:51:46.820 align:start position:0%
we don't have a hand up yet I'm going to
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
try to form our caucus report except
 
01:52:05.530 --> 01:52:05.540 align:start position:0%
that there isn't anything written after
 
01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:09.690 align:start position:0%
that there isn't anything written after
it

01:52:09.690 --> 01:52:09.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:13.670 align:start position:0%
so is there anyone else that can help me
 
01:52:13.670 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
so is there anyone else that can help me
out

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:13.850 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:17.570 align:start position:0%
on this as to why we thought they were
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
too high the first year and not high
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:10.770 align:start position:0%
I can't remember at this point we
 
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
understood the highway funds at the very
 
01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:16.530 align:start position:0%
end when we're getting tired we got
 
01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:20.550 align:start position:0%
anybody in attendees yeah you have rep
 
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
some of Romney and reps of Ames and
 
01:53:25.399 --> 01:53:25.409 align:start position:0%
major all with your hands up now oh they
 
01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:27.810 align:start position:0%
just put them up as I moved over to
 
01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:35.550 align:start position:0%
week eight web surveys first ago she was
 
01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:36.750 align:start position:0%
on the committee of poem has to
 
01:53:39.939 --> 01:53:39.949 align:start position:0%
recollection of your logic the logic
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
James do you I'm sorry Patrick I do not
 
01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:00.750 align:start position:0%
I'd say under the circumstances and the
 
01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:03.630 align:start position:0%
Nate the course this have that we should
 
01:54:10.990 --> 01:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
concur that's a or something we the
 
01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
trouble is we only get this from the
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
revenue focus we don't get breakdown and
 
01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:37.110 align:start position:0%
any time until we can we can we just
 
01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:43.230 align:start position:0%
have that one vitamin when we asked for
 
01:54:46.459 --> 01:54:46.469 align:start position:0%
it this last time we got a monthly
 
01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:53.070 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet which is for the road toll
 
01:54:55.129 --> 01:54:55.139 align:start position:0%
because that's what we'd asked oh no
 
01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:00.570 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
but I only analyzed the road tool
 
01:55:07.890 --> 01:55:07.900 align:start position:0%
because it was a lot took a lot of time
 
01:55:09.689 --> 01:55:09.699 align:start position:0%
to enter it all into an Excel
 
01:55:14.549 --> 01:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet in the future we really I
 
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
think I've asked for this to have more
 
01:55:20.370 --> 01:55:20.380 align:start position:0%
detail in the past and and they didn't
 
01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:24.190 align:start position:0%
want to to make the monthly revenue plan
 
01:55:28.049 --> 01:55:28.059 align:start position:0%
a monthly revenue focus longer so they
 
01:55:31.709 --> 01:55:31.719 align:start position:0%
aren't doing it but but maybe they could
 
01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
provide it to us then we can ask in a
 
01:55:42.959 --> 01:55:42.969 align:start position:0%
way that we can look at it so because
 
01:55:45.479 --> 01:55:45.489 align:start position:0%
this revenue is really important to
 
01:55:57.799 --> 01:55:57.809 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.049 --> 01:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
the agency estimates for these in the
 
01:56:07.969 --> 01:56:07.979 align:start position:0%
first year it's a hundred and twenty
 
01:56:15.019 --> 01:56:15.029 align:start position:0%
four point seven and in the second year
 
01:56:19.339 --> 01:56:19.349 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred and twenty nine hundred
 
01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.879 --> 01:56:32.889 align:start position:0%
and we have nobody here from the
 
01:56:37.649 --> 01:56:37.659 align:start position:0%
highways so I guess we're going to just
 
01:56:47.569 --> 01:56:47.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.299 --> 01:57:06.309 align:start position:0%
is find we also have to have the costs
 
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:09.010 align:start position:0%
of collection as they have revised them
 
01:57:14.490 --> 01:57:14.500 align:start position:0%
I knew no I looked at those just the
 
01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:18.250 align:start position:0%
other day but now I can't find them
 
01:57:18.250 --> 01:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
other day but now I can't find them
again

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:21.250 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:23.729 --> 01:57:23.739 align:start position:0%
yes it's Chris
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
yes you don't need to concern yourself
 
01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:27.070 align:start position:0%
with the cost of collections at this
 
01:57:31.439 --> 01:57:31.449 align:start position:0%
time you use it okay through column D so
 
01:57:33.810 --> 01:57:33.820 align:start position:0%
you do gross yeah and then the cost of
 
01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:35.610 align:start position:0%
collections is netted after the fact
 
01:57:39.149 --> 01:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
reasons on on the schedule before you is
 
01:57:41.609 --> 01:57:41.619 align:start position:0%
that if somebody were to go back to the
 
01:57:46.859 --> 01:57:46.869 align:start position:0%
official revenue plan for 2020 seven
 
01:57:48.299 --> 01:57:48.309 align:start position:0%
point six and that's because they
 
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
deducted the 31.8 in cost of collections
 
01:57:54.689 --> 01:57:54.699 align:start position:0%
your estimates it was two fifty nine
 
01:57:59.819 --> 01:57:59.829 align:start position:0%
point four okay good because they didn't
 
01:58:02.029 --> 01:58:02.039 align:start position:0%
change their cost of collections also
 
01:58:09.629 --> 01:58:09.639 align:start position:0%
they lowered them so so all we have to
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
do is vote on the we don't have to vote
 
01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:17.170 align:start position:0%
on the net sum because it is it follows
 
01:58:24.089 --> 01:58:24.099 align:start position:0%
directly so we'll vote to accept I wish
 
01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:27.670 align:start position:0%
we could get the data that caused us to
 
01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:31.690 align:start position:0%
do this but vote to accept their numbers
 
01:58:38.779 --> 01:58:38.789 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.530 --> 01:58:44.540 align:start position:0%
for in FY 20
 
01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:46.790 align:start position:0%

in the vote that you're going to taste
 
01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:07.400 align:start position:0%

FY 2010 for 4.2 million and we don't
 
02:05:03.670 --> 02:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
have to do the total and for 2021 for FY
 
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
21 the licenses at nine point seven five
 
02:05:25.890 --> 02:05:25.900 align:start position:0%
million all other at 3.3 million and V
 
02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:30.470 align:start position:0%
and we'll have to decide how to whether
 
02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:34.670 align:start position:0%
we round up or down nine nine point
 
02:05:37.690 --> 02:05:37.700 align:start position:0%
eight million and three point three
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%

02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:56.770 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:02.650 align:start position:0%
round us down on whatever then I'm gonna
 
02:06:11.670 --> 02:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
cleaned up reps in a major so on FY 21
 
02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:15.230 align:start position:0%
the licenses would be nine point eight
 
02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:19.310 align:start position:0%
and the others would be three point five
 
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
oh oh oh right three point five sorry
 
02:06:29.110 --> 02:06:29.120 align:start position:0%

down slightly for reasons that were
 
02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate that I put in
 
02:06:51.980 --> 02:06:51.990 align:start position:0%
so so call for a vote them on the fifth
 
02:06:59.570 --> 02:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
game fund licenses in FY 2010 point two

wanted to really thank everybody
 
02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:24.450 align:start position:0%
including those who have had to drop off
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
towards the end for a pretty long and
 
02:15:36.450 --> 02:15:36.460 align:start position:0%
exhausting day and for your the ability
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
that all of us have shown to compromise
 
02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:44.950 align:start position:0%
with each other and to to create yet
 
02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:48.070 align:start position:0%
another non partisan revenue estimate
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
for the house and particularly my
 
02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:55.630 align:start position:0%
colleagues the games
 
02:16:00.180 --> 02:16:00.190 align:start position:0%
patrica Brahmi and nor major in perhaps
 
02:16:03.260 --> 02:16:03.270 align:start position:0%
the river center of importance
 
02:16:11.670 --> 02:16:11.680 align:start position:0%

02:16:13.470 --> 02:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
else wants to make any kind of other
 
02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:16.330 align:start position:0%
comments about this we may still be
 
02:16:19.650 --> 02:16:19.660 align:start position:0%
meeting in executive session another I

hope other sessions after after the 11th
 
02:16:29.070 --> 02:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with Senate bills it's going to
 
02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:31.810 align:start position:0%
depend on whether the Republican caucus
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
decides to vote against the measure that
 
02:16:41.459 --> 02:16:41.469 align:start position:0%
that changes our deadlines so that we
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
can complete this year but I'm very glad
 
02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:47.070 align:start position:0%

02:18:25.650 --> 02:18:25.660 align:start position:0%
Thank You sherry yeah earlier but that
 
02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
was a serious email message that I got
 
02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:33.570 align:start position:0%
it's apparently a credible threat to
 
02:18:36.959 --> 02:18:36.969 align:start position:0%
Manchester and it may or may not spread
 
02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:46.990 align:start position:0%
to Concord you can more likely hear you
 
02:18:51.690 --> 02:18:51.700 align:start position:0%
i yeah i'm saying the there's a credible
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
threat against manchester and maybe
 
02:18:58.400 --> 02:18:58.410 align:start position:0%
Nashua less likely Concord tomorrow
 
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
unknown what time probably the evening
 
02:19:05.299 --> 02:19:05.309 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is looking for
 
02:19:07.740 --> 02:19:07.750 align:start position:0%
truckloads of bricks being delivered to
 
02:19:10.129 --> 02:19:10.139 align:start position:0%
either one of the cities
 
02:19:47.250 --> 02:19:47.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:53.580 --> 02:19:53.590 align:start position:0%
it depends how you vote on extending the
 
02:20:03.019 --> 02:20:03.029 align:start position:0%
deadlines I'm not sure yes
 
02:20:06.929 --> 02:20:06.939 align:start position:0%
can negotiate even compromising yes that
 
02:20:12.929 --> 02:20:12.939 align:start position:0%
would be very good so if it doesn't I
 
02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:15.130 align:start position:0%
think we're going to try to put out some
 
02:20:19.109 --> 02:20:19.119 align:start position:0%
kind of press release or something if we
 
02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:26.350 align:start position:0%
get stopped from continuing on which it
 
02:20:29.099 --> 02:20:29.109 align:start position:0%
seems to me is not appropriate at this
 
02:20:33.059 --> 02:20:33.069 align:start position:0%
time because a lot of other bills in the
 
02:20:36.990 --> 02:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
legislature are nonpartisan also that
 
02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:43.630 align:start position:0%
are stuck by this but anyway I also I I
 
02:20:45.389 --> 02:20:45.399 align:start position:0%
forgot and I really shouldn't have
 
02:20:48.149 --> 02:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
forgotten to include in my thanks the
 
02:20:50.269 --> 02:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
clerk represent Malloy
 
02:20:53.490 --> 02:20:53.500 align:start position:0%
he carries a lot of the burden on these
 
02:20:56.370 --> 02:20:56.380 align:start position:0%
sessions especially revenue estimates
 
02:20:58.849 --> 02:20:58.859 align:start position:0%
where we had to do all of these votes
 
02:21:04.349 --> 02:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
Thank You Dennis welcome my pleasure and
 
02:21:06.929 --> 02:21:06.939 align:start position:0%
thanks to any and all the other supports
 
02:21:11.149 --> 02:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
that and we have had a lot of
 
02:21:14.279 --> 02:21:14.289 align:start position:0%
contribution from both of our caucuses
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.770 --> 02:21:22.780 align:start position:0%
so including Jerry string of who on our
 
02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:26.590 align:start position:0%
site has been running the hosting a lot
 
02:21:33.599 --> 02:21:33.609 align:start position:0%
of the time so so that's I think that
 
02:21:37.679 --> 02:21:37.689 align:start position:0%
concludes today's sessions just one
 
02:21:40.620 --> 02:21:40.630 align:start position:0%
quick comment before you leave yes so as
 
02:21:42.090 --> 02:21:42.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier I'll send out the
 
02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:44.770 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet as you saw in the view I'll
 
02:21:46.740 --> 02:21:46.750 align:start position:0%

from behind and we'll add in the
 
02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:34.810 align:start position:0%
information from today the other piece
 
02:22:35.910 --> 02:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to mention is that
 
02:22:38.190 --> 02:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
when we're concluded here put the
 
02:22:40.050 --> 02:22:40.060 align:start position:0%
information together in the format for
 
02:22:43.610 --> 02:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
your resolution I'll submit it to OLS
 
02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:45.970 align:start position:0%
they should have that turned around I
 
02:22:47.610 --> 02:22:47.620 align:start position:0%
don't think they'll get it done today
 
02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:48.850 align:start position:0%
because I probably won't get it to him
 
02:22:52.620 --> 02:22:52.630 align:start position:0%
before 4 o'clock 1:30 but they'll have
 
02:22:53.730 --> 02:22:53.740 align:start position:0%
it something back for you tomorrow
 
02:22:56.010 --> 02:22:56.020 align:start position:0%
represent so you'll probably be reached
 
02:23:01.139 --> 02:23:01.149 align:start position:0%
out to by less and that's all I have
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you and we can once I
 
02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:13.450 align:start position:0%
get that I can share it around to
 
02:23:18.330 --> 02:23:18.340 align:start position:0%
everyone to the green sheet it will be
 
02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:20.590 align:start position:0%
in a form that we haven't seen before do
 
02:23:23.639 --> 02:23:23.649 align:start position:0%
do them highs and lows I couldn't give
 
02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
you this if you want I can show a sneak
 
02:23:27.330 --> 02:23:27.340 align:start position:0%
peak but I think everybody wants to get
 
02:23:30.210 --> 02:23:30.220 align:start position:0%
going yes I think everybody wants to get
 
02:23:32.120 --> 02:23:32.130 align:start position:0%
going too
 
02:23:35.550 --> 02:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
and I just had a phone call from someone
 
02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:39.220 align:start position:0%
