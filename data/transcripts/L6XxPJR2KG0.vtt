00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
i don't care four years i've been here

okay the reason
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
the reason for my um
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
for my bill is that i had the bad
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
experience of discovering that a friend
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
who was driving all the time
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%

volunteering for the lions and
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
i realized she was speaking about her 50
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
year old children as if they were
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
in elementary school
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i tried to get her to keep talking
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
because i couldn't believe it was that
 
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
bad well it was
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
the report that i was very concerned so
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
i called the dmv
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
and the nice guy who talked to me this
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
was a few years ago said this is very
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
good of you responsible to call and ask
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
us to retest her
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
but you realize that if she asks us who
 
00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
made the request we must by law tell her
 
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
and because her husband was mentally
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
unbalanced person who had also already
 
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
threatened people so seriously that they
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
took his gun collection away
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
which he then re-bought
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh that to one of the other
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
representatives from salem had actually
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
had to go down and file a complaint
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
because after the guy threatened his
 
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.230 align:start position:0%
because after the guy threatened his
wife

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
wife
 
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.189 align:start position:0%
wife
so

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
i chickened out i was afraid to report
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
her because i was afraid of him and it's
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
always weighed heavily on my mind that i
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
didn't do my civic duty because when
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
you all know that you make
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
many many split-second decisions when
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
you're driving and a person who's
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
impaired really can't do that
 
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
so i brought this bill and i realized
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
that by keeping ourselves confidential
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
some people immediately say
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
yes but
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
somebody could do that to be malicious
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
well that's true but you could you could
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
file any kind of complaint to be
 
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.230 align:start position:0%
file any kind of complaint to be
malicious

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
malicious
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
but just in case that would make it more
 
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.230 align:start position:0%
but just in case that would make it more
palatable

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
palatable
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
i asked for the amendment
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
which would say that
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be confidential but the
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
person you
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
asked to be retested
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
would have to request in writing
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
so i figured if somebody
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
really was failing inability
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
they might be
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
a kind of slow at writing that letter
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh because it really says we're in
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
writing and the current rules are
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
nobody loses their license on one
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
one uh
 
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.310 align:start position:0%
one uh
intervention

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
you have to fail a driving test
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
three times to lose your license
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about
 
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
any kind of immediate action
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
when you observe
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
a friend a neighbor
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
someone you know
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
that you feel is really dangerous on the
 
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.710 align:start position:0%
that you feel is really dangerous on the
road

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
there's nothing you can do to make them
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
lose their license
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
all you can do is request that they be
 
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.949 align:start position:0%
all you can do is request that they be
tested

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
tested
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
and it's up to them after that up to the
 
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.470 align:start position:0%
and it's up to them after that up to the
dmv

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
dmv
 
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.829 align:start position:0%
dmv
uh

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:11.430 align:start position:0%
uh
they

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.190 align:start position:0%
they
um

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
yeah because i've been told by people
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know that it sounded like dropping a
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
sledgehammer on somebody that you just
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
suspect is a dangerous driver but you
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
can't our current laws this doesn't do
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
anything to change our current laws that
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
you cannot lose your license unless you
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
fail the written test
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
and the driving test
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
three times and this bill also
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
spells out that the dmv has the right to
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
review that person before they ever go
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
send them a letter to schedule a test
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
they can make some calls and find out uh
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
if anybody else is aware or if somebody
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
says no that sounds really nuts you know
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
this person is is as uh as capable as
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
you and i
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
so it's written as flexibly as possible
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to take questions
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:13.350 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
representative

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative gay good morning
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
i was comparing
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
this bill to the one we heard last term
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
and the the one thing that stuck out to
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
me was the new wording at the beginning
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
of section two to protect family friend
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
and professional relationships
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
and it's just a little bit of a tweak do
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
you know why that was changed to in that
 
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.110 align:start position:0%
you know why that was changed to in that
way

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
well i was
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
i was trying to give a reason
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
because if you didn't care about this
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
person or you didn't have a close
 
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.630 align:start position:0%
person or you didn't have a close
relationship

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
what's the problem if they know that
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
you're the one who requested it
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
but and like in
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's not just in a case like mine where
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
he could have been
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
quite retaliative
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
the other situation that's more much
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
more common
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
is when it's the head of the household
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
and his wife says
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
you really shouldn't be driving of
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
course i'm going to be kicking and
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
screaming when they take my license away
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
so it shouldn't be just
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
a guy not
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
not being uh driving safely anymore but
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
in a case of a of a marriage
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
that's our our parents and kids saying
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
dad you shouldn't or mom you shouldn't
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
be driving anymore
 
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.509 align:start position:0%
be driving anymore
uh

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
it really does serious damage to that
 
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.509 align:start position:0%
it really does serious damage to that
relationship

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh currently doctors
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
we don't see the pair yes we do
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
paragraph roman numeral one
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's old
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
and two doctors testified last time
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
that they did this with patients and
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
guess what
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
the patients just left them
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
because they can't be sued
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
but their their identity is also
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh not protected
 
00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:03.670 align:start position:0%
uh not protected
um

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
at the senior center i heard that one
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
woman came in and in front of everybody
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
she yelled at the director and said did
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
you turn me in
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's how she looked at it he's turned
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
her in
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
she was that was very obviously that she
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
was a dangerous driver anybody watching
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
her park and he said yes i did but he
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have to worry about the damage of
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
their relationship
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative o'hara
 
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just had one quick
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
is this build more focused on just the
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
mental ability of the driver because i
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
did hear you say if they're danger so i
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
didn't know if you were going to start
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
if it was going to start going down um
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
like mexico that's driving
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
strictly more just to
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
well we were modifying
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
modifying an old law which is medically
 
00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:05.110 align:start position:0%
modifying an old law which is medically
unfit

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
unfit
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
and if you're
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
i couldn't hear every word you said
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
were you talking about
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
maybe drug induced
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
you know eli type things
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
like um speeding and stuff like that
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
excessive speeding and stuff like that
 
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.269 align:start position:0%
excessive speeding and stuff like that
no

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
no this really is for medically
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
medically uh unfit which you know covers
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of different causes
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:32.069 align:start position:0%

aaron yes thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.829 align:start position:0%
aaron yes thank you mr chair thank you
um

00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative gay for coming presenting
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay yes um so i'm just wondering uh
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
wants to
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
prevent um somebody from maliciously
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh reporting somebody you know just
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
saying that they were driving
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
and then putting this person through
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know some sort of
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
reports or testing or whatever
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
what what can we do to protect people
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
from being accused of something
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
that they didn't do
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
well there are built-in safeguards
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
luckily they're already
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
already in law
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
are at least in practice in rules
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
that the identity
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the person who is being uh
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
asked to be retested i don't know how to
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
neatly but if you request somebody to be
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
tested or at least looked at
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
um because they might not end up being
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
tested if the person checks out if the
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
dmv checks this person out before they
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
ever talk to the person or send them a
 
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.509 align:start position:0%
ever talk to the person or send them a
letter

00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
and determines that there's no problem
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
there is no public no public access to
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that this person has been
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
looked at that's current practice
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
both not only your identity my original
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
bill is that your identity if you're
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
requesting this person to be looked at
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
your identity is protected their
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
identity is protected too throughout the
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
entire process from beginning to end
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
that is not public record
 
00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:25.269 align:start position:0%
that is not public record
um

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
and so because you know because of the
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
concern that somebody would be malicious
 
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.790 align:start position:0%
concern that somebody would be malicious
um

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
in paragraph three
 
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
some people criticized
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh that because the reporting person's
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
identity shall not remain con
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
confidential in any instance where the
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
division deems the complaint malicious
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
and somebody said well that's not
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
that's not clear enough i'm thinking
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
anybody on this committee knows if
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
they've been had
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
and so i i think that's uh that's
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
reality we know if somebody's uh
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
claiming something you can
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
listen to them because you could talk to
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
them too
 
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.790 align:start position:0%
them too
um

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
but that's why i offered the amendment
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
that said
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
they're confident the re the person who
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
makes the request their identity would
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
not be held confidential
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
person they asked to be tested
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
would have to write a letter they
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
couldn't just call on the phone and say
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
who you know who made you do this they'd
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
have to write a letter
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
and i figure if they're really
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman
 
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.590 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman
and

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.030 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
is there any penalty for um reporting
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
something like this in a malicious
 
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.389 align:start position:0%
something like this in a malicious
manner

00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
well they get known
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
and they look they've lost they've lost
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
respect because as chances are then the
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
dmv would ask the police do you have
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
problem with this driver
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
because they could say oh yeah they've
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
had like three fender brenders in the
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
past two months uh
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
so they're they're putting their they
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
have to make this in writing they have
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
to sign this statement
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
so they're damaging their own
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.949 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%

good morning again and um thank you for
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak in front of you
 
00:20:58.159 --> 00:20:59.029 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak in front of you
today

00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
i am speaking in opposition to this bill
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative telersky is correct that
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
heard this bill in the past as well
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
and we have opposed that in the past as
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
well i also shared with the committee a
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
handout that i wanted to discuss did
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
everyone see that from me
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
it would have been
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
a little earlier this morning and but i
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
let me just see
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
there we go can you see that okay
 
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.830 align:start position:0%
there we go can you see that okay
we

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
about now
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's coming there you go yeah perfect so
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to really take a
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
look at the data and the statistics um
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
to really have a frame of reference when
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
we're speaking about this bill you can
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
see the last seven calendar years
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
related to administrative actions taken
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
by the director oh and i'm sorry i'm
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
gonna back up for the record my name is
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
elizabeth bialecki director of motor
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles representing the dmv
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
um so you can see that really the
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
majority of the requests that we are
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
getting are coming from law enforcement
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
followed closely by medical
 
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.310 align:start position:0%
followed closely by medical
professionals

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
and very few requests that we receive
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
are actually requests by family members
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
but it's also important to note that of
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
those that are received from family
 
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.870 align:start position:0%
those that are received from family
members

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
the significant percentage of them were
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
actually taking immediate action so let
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
me just speak really briefly about the
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
options that we have depending on the
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances that are described in the
 
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:46.950 align:start position:0%
circumstances that are described in the
letter

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
we can either bring the individual in
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
for re-exam
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
meaning we will do a full vision test
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
we'll do a knowledge test and finally if
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
those two are passed we'll take the
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
individual out for a road test
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
we can bring them in for a hearing and
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
that will be likely medical hearing
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances described
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
give us an indication of maybe medical
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
issues and in that case they'll have an
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing where they'll
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
have to prove that they are medically
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
fit to continue to drive
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
but in many instances for example 16 out
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
of the 20 that we received during 2020
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
we take immediate action and we
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
typically take that action on under rsa
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
263 59 which is
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
suspension foreign competency or
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
improper driving what that means is the
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances that are being described
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
to us are significant enough where we
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
decide to take the individual's license
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
right away because there's immediate
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
danger for them to continue to be
 
00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:45.750 align:start position:0%
danger for them to continue to be
driving

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
driving
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
i will tell you also that with any of
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
these administrative actions we handle
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
them with a lot of care especially the
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
ones that are coming in from the family
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
member my assistants will actually just
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
call and discuss the circumstances with
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
the family member and let them know that
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
their identity will not be kept
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
confidential so that if the individual
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
who is being
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
retested brought in for a hearing or
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
whose license is being immediately
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
suspended asks the question we have to
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
share with them who's reported them in
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
instances where the family member has
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
reservations about doing that they do
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
have other options meaning
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
reach out to their local law enforcement
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
and request that maybe they review
 
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.390 align:start position:0%
and request that maybe they review
the

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
um the driving record of the individual
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
to see if it rises to a request that can
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
be put into us
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
or reach out to a family to a family
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
physician or a medical provider and as
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
you can see again from the numbers that
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
i provided to you the majority of those
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
requests are coming from those
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
we again take these requests very
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
seriously and evaluate the circumstances
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
i know that representative gay is
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
looking for us to research the driving
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
ability and we usually do but there are
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
many of these circumstances where um
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
these individuals already are not
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
driving a whole lot so their motor
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle driving history might be perfect
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
they might not have any fender benders
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
they might not have any violations they
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
might actually have
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
a really good driving history and
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
there's no indication from looking at
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
that that there are any issues
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
we also know that family members really
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
know um
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
the driving abilities of their um of
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
their family member the best so we do
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
take um we we put a lot of weight on the
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
requests that are received by us
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
so again
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
there aren't that many there are other
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
options for family members that are not
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
feeling comfortable putting
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
a request in
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons i would
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that you itl the bill
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your time and
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
attention i'm happy to take any
 
00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.510 align:start position:0%
attention i'm happy to take any
questions

00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you director any questions from
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
chief representative representative
 
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.710 align:start position:0%
chief representative representative
sykes

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
sykes
 
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative uh director belecki thank
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
do you have any statistics on the
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
numbers of
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
as free as
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
the issue brought forward by this bill
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
what i might call malicious reports
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
um i don't representative sykes um
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
because we really
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that we always make personal
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
contact with the reporting party we kind
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
of gauge as to whether they have an idea
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
is it is it really a true request is
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
someone having um if you know is are the
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
circumstances different than what
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
they're describing so i think the fact
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
that we're making personal contact we're
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
asking them to put in the request and
 
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.590 align:start position:0%
asking them to put in the request and
writing

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
sign it as well i think that puts a lot
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
of weight in on that process as well so
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
they really think about the
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances and they really think
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
about the consequences of putting in
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
that request
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes representative hill
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman and thank
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
you director for
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
coming and speaking with us
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
um i want to publicly thank you you
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
helped me in this situation uh just in
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
the last year with uh
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
with a mother-in-law driving um
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
my question today is um is in relation
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
to those three categories you just gave
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
us uh the law enforcement the medical
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
professional and family
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything on there from
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
the neighbor that watches
 
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.789 align:start position:0%
the neighbor that watches
the

00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
elderly driver
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
backing out and
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
taking out trash cans every day
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
is that an option is there is there
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
something that allows uh
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
just a friendly observer from
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
saying that uh this person shouldn't be
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
driving any longer
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm happy
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
that we were able to assist in your
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
personal situation as well um no the
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
answer to that question is no if there
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
is a neighbor or a bystander or someone
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
who's not related their option would be
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
to report it to the local law
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement and allow them to take it
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
from there but we would not um take any
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
action based on we on a report from
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
someone who's not related
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
thank you uh follow a quick follow-up
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
follow up um
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
this is um a tremendously difficult uh
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
procedure i i wouldn't have anticipated
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
it um and i'm sure i'll be one of those
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
as well that uh is drag kicking and
 
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
screaming but it is um
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's important to me that the that the
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
department um not handle things as
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
as clinically um i i don't know if
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
there's an easier way and i'm i'm hoping
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
the director has some suggestions
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps of
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
rather than having someone come in and
 
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.149 align:start position:0%
rather than having someone come in and
and

00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
walking out without their license um
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
is there any other procedure that takes
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
place across the country that you're
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
aware of that that may be
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that um
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
again we have a very
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
we have a process that very detailed um
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
i personally review every single one of
 
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
them i don't delegate this at this
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
authority to anybody else so all of
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
those in 2020 the 267 law enforcement
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
requests the 147 medical and family i
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
sign off on every single one of them
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
oftentimes i will request additional
 
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.590 align:start position:0%
oftentimes i will request additional
information

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
specifically when it's from law
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement if i see multiple accidents
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
on someone's records i will
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
request the accident reports and
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
personally review all of them
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
i really don't take this
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
this task very lightly because i know
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
that i'm really taking away someone's
 
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.710 align:start position:0%
that i'm really taking away someone's
driving

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
driving
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
privileges at the end of the road so
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
this is a task that
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
again i carefully review myself
 
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.789 align:start position:0%
again i carefully review myself
um

00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
i think if we looked at what the process
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
is somewhere else you probably would
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
find that is it is a bit more automated
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
than it is in new hampshire so i'm
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
really proud of the fact that we are
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
able to really
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
carefully review the circumstances and
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
not just look at this as another process
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
but really see the people that are
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
behind the letters that we are receiving
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks my question
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
thank you director thank you
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative hill that is the quickest
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up i think i can remember
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
next up chair recognizes representative
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
director barack belecki for your
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
testimony and answering my question here
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
you kind of partially answered it about
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
you eventually sign off but my i guess
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
my initial question is when someone
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
makes a report whether whether it's a
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
family member or medical professional
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
law enforcement who's kind of like the
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
first person who handles it at the dmv
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
and how does it get processed from there
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
before it gets down eventually to you
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
for the sign off sure um so it actually
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
comes those type of requests come to the
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
office of the director um i've got a
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
couple employees that actually gather
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
that or intake all of that information
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes they kind of know what my
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
process is so they see that it's an
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
incomplete request they will reach out
 
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.310 align:start position:0%
incomplete request they will reach out
and

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
follow up for some information
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of information available
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
throughout our system as well so
 
00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:42.710 align:start position:0%
throughout our system as well so
oftentimes

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
oftentimes
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
they will actually
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
prepare for me the motor vehicle driving
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
history any related accident reports or
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
anything else that is within our system
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
that would help me make the
 
00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.110 align:start position:0%
that would help me make the
determination

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
we also work very closely with poop g
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm very lucky to have sergeant case
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
which i know you've met him in his
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
testimony at times as well he kind of
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
takes the prosecution approach to a lot
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
of these meaning that if we bring
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
someone in for a hearing he'll represent
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
the dmv to present
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
our position on some of these as well
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
so if the circumstances are a little
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
different and i'm struggling with what
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
decision i want to make oftentimes i'll
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
bring him in and ask for his advice on
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
some of these as well um so again just a
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
quick intake process to gather any
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
supporting documents that would help
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
make the decision and then my careful
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
review and sometimes the assistance of
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
law enforcement did i have any questions
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative gorski uh it does a
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
little bit but can i have a follow-up mr
 
00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:41.190 align:start position:0%
little bit but can i have a follow-up mr
chairman

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
hello uh so basically the the people who
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
are taking the intake you mentioned the
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
first two are they just in taking
 
00:32:48.159 --> 00:32:49.590 align:start position:0%
first two are they just in taking
information

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
or are they looking at it to kind of do
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
some type of assessment
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
they really just are taking the
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
information kind of putting the whole
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
packet together where the request is
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
coming from any supporting documentation
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
and kind of adding anything else to
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
create a whole
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
case for me based on which i can make a
 
00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:08.070 align:start position:0%
case for me based on which i can make a
decision

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
great thank you doc thank you director
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
blecky let me see one more
 
00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:12.710 align:start position:0%
blecky let me see one more
representative

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh commissioner blacky i i
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming today and
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
giving all this great information
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
i'm interested to know
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
what is about the average time between
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
a report
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
and the conclusion of the reporting
 
00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:34.470 align:start position:0%
and the conclusion of the reporting
period

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
we turn these around pretty quickly so
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
depending on how quickly
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
my staff really processes these daily um
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
so depending on how quickly they can
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
gather any supporting documentation we
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
really within two three maybe two to
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
three business days have a decision that
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
being said
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
if it's a hearing we pass it on to the
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
hearing queue so the individual will be
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
scheduled for a hearing probably within
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
15 business day or so
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
if it's a re-exam
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
we pass it on to our licensing bureau
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
and they'll reach out and schedule
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
them to come in for a re-exam so that
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
could take a week or two depending on
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
availability of appointments if it's an
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
immediate suspension we will send out a
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
letter that gives the individual five
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
business days before their license goes
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
under suspension
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
so we allow that mail time
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
um to be um so that the individual is
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and so when a person
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
is reported
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh is there any kind of like
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
probation or that they should not be
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
driving until this is all figured out
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
um no thank you for the question um they
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
really may continue to drive until
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
again depending on the action if it's
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
re-exam they continue to have the
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
ability to drive unless they fail three
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
times as representative gay mentioned if
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
they fail their
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
exams for example knowledge test if they
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
fail it three times um that will be a
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
suspension of their license
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
if they at at a hearing if they come in
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
for a hearing at the conclusion of the
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
hearing they can still drive home and
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
there'll be a hearing report that is
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
issued within usually 20 days of the
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
hearing in which a decision will be made
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
so they still have some more time on the
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
quickest suspension is again with the
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
immediate suspension
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
and that will be within five days of us
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
making that decision
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
to allow us to give them time to be
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank notified and just one other
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
quick very quickly yes thank you okay um
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
and so and also how do you deal with uh
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
some of these folks who may be very
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
belligerent during the whole
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
process um
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
what if they don't want to come in and
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
be tested or you know they
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
honestly we don't see a whole lot of
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
that i think these individuals if it's a
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
family member that reports them they
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
kind of know it's coming if it's a
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
medical provider that reports them they
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
typically have a conversation with them
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
before they um send us the letter so
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
again they're kind of expecting it and
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
oftentimes people just don't show up
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
we'll schedule them for a retest to come
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
in for a knowledge test and then they
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
they don't show up so again we'll give
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
them three chances if they don't show up
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
once we'll reschedule them for the test
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
again if they don't show up the second
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
time they get a third try and three
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
strikes and that's when we will take um
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
the action to suspend them as well so
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
um we don't see a lot of them that
 
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.430 align:start position:0%
um we don't see a lot of them that
really

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.630 align:start position:0%
really
are

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
showing their emotions while going
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
through the process
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
whenever you're already represented you
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
have the floor
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill is uh came about as as a
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
result of a
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
constituent request
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
i would also tell you that for ease of
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
um conversation that this pond is also
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
known locally
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
as meter ponds so that's a little easier
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
meter m-e-a-d-e
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah it's a little easier
 
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.950 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah it's a little easier
um

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.309 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
the story goes like this so we have i
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
have um
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
some folks who
 
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.790 align:start position:0%
some folks who
are

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
have great difficulty paddling they have
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
no upper body strength
 
00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.470 align:start position:0%
no upper body strength
remaining

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
remaining
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
one of those persons actually has a
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
handicapped plate as well
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
and but they also know that the state of
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire fish and game department
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
regularly stocks meter pond with trout
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
and so and they love to go trout fishing
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
it is already on the list for
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
prohibiting any type of motorized
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
transport on the pond which is not an
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
uncommon thing in new hampshire
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
but they have great difficulty paddling
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
so they
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
are not able to enjoy
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
this really great pond that's close to
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
their home
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
um the criteria under which
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
ponds are chosen to be protected in this
 
00:41:53.839 --> 00:41:54.790 align:start position:0%
ponds are chosen to be protected in this
way

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
according to the fish and game and the
 
00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.030 align:start position:0%
according to the fish and game and the
also

00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
the department of safety's
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
they have shared responsibilities for
 
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.750 align:start position:0%
they have shared responsibilities for
this

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.750 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
are that a pond needs to be if it's
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
under 10 acres
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
and under
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
i forget the depths quite frankly but
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
under a certain depth then
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
propeller driven
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know motor boats etc are prohibited
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
and that's to protect
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
the the pond and that's not an
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
unreasonable situation
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
by the way this pond is in the white
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
mountain national forest as well
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
the state does have a list of exceptions
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
the the original authorization for
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
prohibiting pods has a a long list of
 
00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:42.790 align:start position:0%
prohibiting pods has a a long list of
exceptions

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
so i did some research spoke to fish and
 
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.069 align:start position:0%
so i did some research spoke to fish and
game

00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
game
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
spoke to the department of safety
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
tried to ask them
 
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:50.790 align:start position:0%
tried to ask them
was

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
how do how did these these laws
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
treat fairly
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
handicapped individuals
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
and they really didn't have a good
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
answer the answer was well you know
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's really a good idea we should
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
probably think about doing something
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh the thinking about doing something
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
has not resulted in any action however
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
through rules or through legislation i
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
also learned in my research that
 
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.750 align:start position:0%
also learned in my research that
meteopond

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
meteopond
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
while it's on the list of prohibited
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
to motors
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
is over 10 acres and is over the not not
 
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
in its entirety of course but um is over
 
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.550 align:start position:0%
in its entirety of course but um is over
the

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
depth where it would be typically
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh prohibited
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
i did ask why that the pond was on that
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
list and did not receive
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
any clarity from either of the
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
departments it's just what's always been
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
on the list
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with that i i think
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we should be making recreational
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities available on an equal
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
basis to handicapped individuals
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
nothing in the
 
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.390 align:start position:0%
nothing in the
the

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
stated reasons for keeping this pond
 
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.990 align:start position:0%
stated reasons for keeping this pond
listed

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
listed
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of criteria are met and so i
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
felt that the only possible solution was
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislatively and this bill would add
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
meter ponds specifically
 
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.150 align:start position:0%
meter ponds specifically
to

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
trolling electric trolling motor only
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's commercially available
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
and only if one of the persons operating
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
the the canoe which is typical
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
has a handicap plate as well and that's
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any questions
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative did you say the pond is
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
larger than 10 acres
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
yes i went on the usgs map and
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
did scaled it out and it is over 10
 
00:44:49.359 --> 00:44:50.630 align:start position:0%
did scaled it out and it is over 10
acres

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
acres
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
and i obviously had to do some
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
conversion maybe my
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully my math was right
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
are there any um ada
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
accessibility requirements for things
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
um not specific to the the inability to
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
use motorized
 
00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.390 align:start position:0%
use motorized
conveyances

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
conveyances
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
there may be otherwise
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't delve into it carefully enough
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
to know
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
but i do know that specific to not being
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
able to use a motorized
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
method of conveyance there is no
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
handicapped uh exception
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh i have one more question
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
i may get the answer but i don't
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
recognize the names uh you said you
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
dealt with the fish and game
 
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.950 align:start position:0%
dealt with the fish and game
department

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
usually when there's legislation before
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
then the commission does take a gathered
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
opinion do you know if they've
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
determined the opinion
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
oh you know
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
i went looking for my notes honestly
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
this most of those discussions happened
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
more than seven months ago
 
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
um just because this has been a
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
the this first came to my attention
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
after the end of the legislative season
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
in private prior session and so
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
i kept trying to talk to people that uh
 
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.109 align:start position:0%
i kept trying to talk to people that uh
and

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
i don't remember i apologized it was
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
captain um there was a captain from
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
the department of safety and then
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
someone from fish and game as well uh i
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
mean are they on your witness list well
 
00:46:30.319 --> 00:46:31.109 align:start position:0%
mean are they on your witness list well
i

00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps will get the answer i i don't
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
recognize them i just figured that i
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
figured i'd ask first so yeah i'm sorry
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
i should have uh prepped a little better
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
for this um
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
the there was something that you asked
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
that question and there was something
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
else i was going to add and now i've
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
forgotten maybe it'll come back
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative phil is your hand still
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
up or did you have another question
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative wesley
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and and thank you
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative spike sykes to take my uh
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
question i just want to get some clarity
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just getting confused a little bit
 
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.790 align:start position:0%
i'm just getting confused a little bit
um

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
are you saying that no motor
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
can be used over 55 pounds at all
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
are you saying
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
it can only be used if someone in the
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
boat has a handicap plate
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
both so
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
they are restricted to a specific type
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
of moto motor which is the again the
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
smallest commercially available electric
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
trolling motor for anybody
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
for any no yes that's that's the only
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
type of motor and only if they have a
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
handicapped plate and that's what thank
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
you for that question because it
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
reminded me that the point of those two
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions particularly the
 
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
handicapped plate one was a
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
a matter of fairness quite obviously but
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
also would limit the numbers of people
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
who are using these pods because we do
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
so so so uh follow-up is the channel
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
so just to get clarity for me maybe it's
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
maybe my pole is showing me again i
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
don't know um
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's so
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
you're saying that
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
that a 55
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
pound motor
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
can be used on the pond
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
as long as
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
one of the people who are in the boat
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
has a handicap plate correct
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
senator pickering
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.910 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
in the past before this committee um
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
there's been an issue when a
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
when a written suggested law
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
is too specific and i just wondered if
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
you could help me understand
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
why there isn't
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
why doesn't doesn't this fit into any
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
bigger category as far as the
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
distinction between petroleum power
 
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.510 align:start position:0%
distinction between petroleum power
versus

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:02.549 align:start position:0%
versus
electric

00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
electric
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
and as far as sizes it sounds to me like
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
you ran into a problem but then the
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
solution seems to be awfully specific so
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
could you address that for me please
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
sure um i chose this methodology because
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
if you look at the list of other ponds
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
um i think there's more than 20 of them
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
that are accepted out from the general
 
00:49:23.359 --> 00:49:24.630 align:start position:0%
that are accepted out from the general
requirement

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
and every one of them has a different
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
explanation for the reason for their
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
being excluded
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i chose this methodology to go back
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
to representative dorsey's point
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
question was i very much want to limit
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
the amount of people who will be using
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
that pond because it's a very
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
environmentally sensitive
 
00:49:46.319 --> 00:49:47.270 align:start position:0%
environmentally sensitive
area

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
um it's in the
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
well the pond spreads around several
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
towns but it's up in the thornton
 
00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.069 align:start position:0%
towns but it's up in the thornton
warren

00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
warren
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
basically grafton county uh and in the
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
national forest so
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
that that's the reason for the very the
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
incredible specificity
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
of the requirements
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you

thank you my name is tim dunleavy and
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
i'm captain with the new hampshire state

police marine patrol unit
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
and i i thank you for taking my
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
honourable members of the transportation
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
committee the department of safety and
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
marine patrol
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
opposes this bill
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
and i will qualify my statements by
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
saying in no
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
way are we looking to
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
not be sensitive to the needs of those
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
who have uh intellectual or physical
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
challenges in our state to be able to
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
use our public waters
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
the the issue here with
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
watch apoca ponder meter pond is we like
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
to to use with the locals especially
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
is that rsa 270 29
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
supersedes all the
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
authority of the commissioner of safety
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
to adopt regulations
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
and that that statute has prohibited the
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
use of any mechanical power
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
on any body of water within the white
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
mountain national forest
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
and that statute further goes for goes
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
forward to
 
00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:50.470 align:start position:0%
forward to
um

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
accept several bodies of water that you
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
as the legislature
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledged should be made available to
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh motorboats stinson lake for example
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
the percy ponds and stark
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
kimball pond and chatham and long pond
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
which is nearby to meter pond and benton
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
those have
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
easy public access by vehicle quite
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
frankly and i suspect that's why the
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
legislature exempted them
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
meter pond
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
maps that they have for fishing on their
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
website lists meter pond as a walk-in
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
remote site although i can tell you
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i investigated a drowning
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
there years ago and and there is a a
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
rough uh
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
road or path into the pond
 
00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:41.349 align:start position:0%
road or path into the pond
um

00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative spike uh sykes speaks to
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
our conversation and how various
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions exist around the state for
 
00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.430 align:start position:0%
restrictions exist around the state for
these

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.390 align:start position:0%
these
uh

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
power boats
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
outside of the national forest uh due to
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
the statutes
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
those bodies of water over 10 acres in
 
00:52:59.359 --> 00:53:00.549 align:start position:0%
those bodies of water over 10 acres in
size

00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
size
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
are considered public waters and
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
therefore fall into the jurisdiction of
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
and statute allows through the public
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
hearing process for
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
a petition to be submitted by the
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
general public to change or to create
 
00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.030 align:start position:0%
general public to change or to create
restrictions

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
on our public waters
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
so representative sykes is very uh
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
correct when he says that there are 20
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
or so bodies of water that have these
 
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.270 align:start position:0%
or so bodies of water that have these
unique

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
unique
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions or exemptions
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
and and that has been established
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
through the petition process where where
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
folks uh seek a change
 
00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.710 align:start position:0%
folks uh seek a change
so

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
with that that's a little history of how
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
these uh restrictions come to be
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
in in this case this restriction is by
 
00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.190 align:start position:0%
in in this case this restriction is by
statute

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
and it is for the protection of a lot of
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
our remote smaller ponds uh in the
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
national forest
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
meter pond is a 28-acre pond with an
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
average depth of about 10 feet
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
and it is a popular trout fishing
 
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.390 align:start position:0%
and it is a popular trout fishing
location

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
from an enforcement perspective our
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
concern is is if we encounter
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
someone out there with an electric motor
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
the ability sometimes to track down
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh that that plate due to the remoteness
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
of this pond may find the vehicle in
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
some some other
 
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.069 align:start position:0%
some some other
uh

00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
location significantly further away from
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
the pond um and so uh
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
under these circumstances and and
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
because of the existing restrictions uh
 
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
we reflect respectfully ask that this be
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
found in expedia to legislate i'm happy
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:43.510 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
committee

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.710 align:start position:0%

00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair could you just uh

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
emily uh could you just repeat the rsa
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
frame it's 270
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
it is uh 270
 
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.710 align:start position:0%
it is uh 270
standby

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
270 colon 29 operation prohibited
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
it's a relatively brief statute that if
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
you'd like me to read i'd be happy to do
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
so no i just needed the number thank you
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
so much
 
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.510 align:start position:0%
so much
representative

00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'll be very brief
 
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
um i just have the same question what
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
what do we have for
 
00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.630 align:start position:0%
what do we have for
access

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
via ada requirements for
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
i can't speak specifically as as fish
 
00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
and game is the agency that oversees
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
public access and boat launches but what
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
i am familiar with is that when federal
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
funds are used to create public access
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
um then then certainly ada uh compliance
 
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
must be uh
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
factored into that
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
oftentimes and i know there are numerous
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
bodies of water around the state where
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
where ada compliant fishing piers uh
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
shoreline fishing piers are part of that
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
that access and development
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
um and we and and there are examples
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
where our public hearing process
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
has opened up bodies of water to
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
mechanical power for those
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
with with challenges
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
but those bodies of waterfall outside
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
restrictions have been changed due to
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
that that public input and the public
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
hearing process
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
in this case meter pond is is already
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
covered by a statute um
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
where where obviously that would trump
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
any ability of the department to to
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
create an exception
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
and the fact that it's in the national
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
forest with all our other
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
restricted smaller bodies of water
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:50.549 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%

this

00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair i am
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
going to introduce this bill house bill
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
100 which is relative to driving on the
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
left of an unbroken painted line
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
seeks an exemption to the prohibition on
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
crossing unbroken painted center lines
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'll just i'll remind you
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'll bring everybody up to speed on this
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
this was a bill that was put in
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh last term by at the time
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative flanagan
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
with just issues that had happened um
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
actually people get excited for crossing
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
the unbroken painted line
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
in circumstances where they had no
 
01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.230 align:start position:0%
in circumstances where they had no
choice

01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
so i looked at it as just a host keeping
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
the bill and just a common sense built
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
it was his experience that he'd actually
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
been taking it if i remember correctly
 
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.150 align:start position:0%
been taking it if i remember correctly
for

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
making maneuver across the painted line
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
but he had no choice to because of the
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
vehicle parked on the side of the road
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
or at the time i think there was also uh
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
emergency equipment et cetera et cetera
 
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:42.710 align:start position:0%
emergency equipment et cetera et cetera
so

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh there is a simple bill that's why you
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
see it again again this did pass last
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
year and it was also one of those bills
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
that made it to the senate but did not
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
rise to the level of importance enough
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
to make it to one of their on the bus
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
bills so it has been reintroduced
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's not delayed
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair can you just and i
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if even you remember going
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
back to the first time this was
 
01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:09.430 align:start position:0%
back to the first time this was
introduced

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
we had a problem with it and then it was
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
amended again
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment that finally got us to
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
pass it last year was it just clarifying
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
you know that's a great question and
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
that is taxing my memory i know i'm
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
sorry no that's okay it's good i'm gonna
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
look into it um we'll get the answers on
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
that before we try to execute this thing
 
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:42.069 align:start position:0%
that before we try to execute this thing
thanks

01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.040 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
that william lambert from the new
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire d.o.t
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
had registered to testify on this bill
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
but had inadvertently checked that he
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
opposed uh this bill but actually he
 
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.589 align:start position:0%
opposed uh this bill but actually he
doesn't

01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
he is in favor of it so i just wanted to
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
bring that to your attention thank you
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
it was on my list of things to do okay
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.559 --> 01:02:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman the question is
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
for you maybe you can help me with
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
memory as well when you're looking at
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
the last version that we passed i i
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
can't recall whether it called out an
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
exception just for bicycles and
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
non-motorized pedestrians etc i thought
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
was you could do that under you know if
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
you needed to
 
01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.750 align:start position:0%
you needed to
under

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
safe you know it was a safe operation
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm a little concerned are we
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
hearing from any of the bicyclists
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
bicycling community about this
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
01:02:46.839 --> 01:02:48.710 align:start position:0%
particular bill
um

01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.910 align:start position:0%
um
just

01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
i i i'm sure they might have an opinion
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
i just wondered if they're signed up
 
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.069 align:start position:0%
i just wondered if they're signed up
um

01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
we'll see i don't they don't recognize
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
themselves obviously at this point who
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
they represent uh i
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
just heard representative aaron um
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
that mr lambert from dot is in favor of
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and i have to be honest with
 
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
you my memory is not as good as it used
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
to be in terms of the changes last year
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
all i can say is that we'll look into it
 
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.150 align:start position:0%
all i can say is that we'll look into it
before

01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:18.400 align:start position:0%

this was a bill put it by a former
representative

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
okay it's returned as a currency more or
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
less okay because it did actually pass
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
and uh we just wanted it to pass again
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%

01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
before we attempt to execute this good
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
questions i'll close the public hearing
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%

01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
this bill does two things
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
one it adds the new hampshire motorcycle
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
rights organization to the traffic
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
safety commission the traffic safety
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
commission is a group of
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
people who represent various industries
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
and transportation vehicles school bus
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
drivers and new hampshire motor
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
transport association
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
the department of safety and a variety
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
of other people so that when there are
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
traffic safety issues all the
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are in the room this would
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
add the new hampshire motorcycle rights
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
organization to that and that's
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate they are the leading force
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire for investigating
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
motorcycle issues safety issues and in
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
addition they provide a great motorcycle
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
safety class that's offered by many
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
people so it's appropriate for them to
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
have a seat at the table
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
the second thing that it does is uh one
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
of our statutes doesn't let you have
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
more than three lights on the front of a
 
01:26:30.719 --> 01:26:31.910 align:start position:0%
more than three lights on the front of a
motorcycle

01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
motorcycle
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
now there are a lot of bikes that have
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
dual headlights and then for safety you
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
also want the lights that are on the
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
bars down by the roads so they can see
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
if there's a raccoon laying in the road
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
easier it gives you a more close-up view
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
so if you have one on each side and the
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
bike came from the factory once your
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
headlights steps four
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
and while the national highway traffic
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
safety administration says this is a
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
good thing to do and many bikes actually
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
come from the factory with this lighting
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
installed they're illegal in new
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire so and consider the second
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
part of the build a clean up measure so
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
that we are not conflicting with federal
 
01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.590 align:start position:0%
that we are not conflicting with federal
regulations

01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
and that is the bill thank you mr
 
01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.270 align:start position:0%
and that is the bill thank you mr

01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
i want to get two people signed up to

01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
as representative smith said
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists have never been
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative on this commission
 
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
and as a big part of the roadway users
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we feel that
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists should have a voice
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
last session
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
we came before the same commission i
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
mean before the same committee
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
requesting to be put on this commission
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
the the transportation committee last
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
session did vote to put us on
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
the full house voted to put us on and
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
what happened in all the chaos
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
we did not make or the bill did not make
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
it to the senate to be voted uh so we're
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
here again unfortunately
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
doing it all over um for those of you
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
who do not know nhmr i just want to take
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
a quick few minutes because i don't want
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
to waste anybody's time
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
just to tell you a little bit about what
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
we do
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
we came up with a ride smart program i
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
know it's a little bit hard for all of
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
you to see it
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
but it represents a lot of what new
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire motorcycle rights does
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
writing smart safely maturely aware
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
respectfully and trained in 2019 we took
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
this and we went and met with captain
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
haynes of the new hampshire state police
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
and we started a motorcycle task force
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
we then partnered with new hampshire
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
automobile dealers association the
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
office of highway safety
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
triple a and i i heart media in the
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
writer's education program and went
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
further with it and came up with a
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
hashtag live free ride smart program so
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
we've now gone statewide we now have
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
monies funded from the 402 funds and
 
01:29:48.159 --> 01:29:49.270 align:start position:0%
monies funded from the 402 funds and
nitsa

01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
nitsa
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
and we now have psas out there for
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
writing smart and riding safely so we
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
have a big voice something that
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists have never had in this
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
state on how to ride safely how to write
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
smart we believe that that making smart
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
and knowledgeable
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
riders make smarter riders and better
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
riders so we're doing a lot of things
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
that motorcyclists have never done in
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
this state so being part of this
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
commission we feel like would be a very
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
good thing for the rest of the safety
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
commission the rest of the roadway users
 
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
and a very important thing for
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists so again i respectfully
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
request that you support this bill and
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%

okay and cat follow up real quick mr
chairman

01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.470 align:start position:0%
chairman
follow-up

01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay do you see any hazard
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
for auto drivers when there's four
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
headlights coming towards them
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
so did he i and i i had just it's kind
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
of echoey did you say do i see any
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
hazard with four headlights coming at a
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
car from a motorcycle yeah for a vision
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
or anything standpoint
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
i i i would say no i think one as a
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist and and also having cars i
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
think for for us
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
motorcycles need to be
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
visually seen and i and i don't think
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem with having
 
01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:19.510 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem with having
more

01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
more light you know
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
i agree thank you
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%

uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
speak with you all this morning um
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
i do wish that we were uh in the back of
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
room 203 but it is what it is so i hope
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
to see you all there soon uh my name is
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
dan bennett i'm with the new hampshire
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
auto dealers association
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
we represent car truck motorcycle
 
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
snowmobile dealers um across the state
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
so we are here in support of um hb 461
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
as we were on this bill uh dealing with
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
motorcycle lamping as well as the
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
traffic safety commission uh both bills
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
which easily passed last year we are in
 
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
support of the discussion on auxiliary
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
lamping started between ourselves and
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
department of safety troop g uh about a
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago when we realized
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
either through aftermarket lamping or
 
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
straight from the manufacturer vehicles
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
were in violation of our safety wall so
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
auxiliary lamping allows greater
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
visibility for both the rider as well as
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
oncoming traffic and unfortunately the
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
current law doesn't allow more than
 
01:33:14.639 --> 01:33:15.750 align:start position:0%
current law doesn't allow more than
three

01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
because a motorcycle is lumped in with
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
the definition of motor vehicle
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
it really applies to cars it doesn't
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
apply to bikes um
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
when bikes add lights they add them in
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
even numbers they don't add them in odd
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
numbers they're done in pairs it's done
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
on the left and right of the fork a left
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
and right of the foot peg
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
hanging down uh from the two main lamps
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
the way um deputy speaker smith
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned so for any of you all i know i
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
sent something around to the committee
 
01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.030 align:start position:0%
sent something around to the committee
yesterday

01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
and hopefully you all received it i did
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
not i did not have it in color here but
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
from the pictures that i sent to you all
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
you can see the various types of lamping
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
that folks do
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
to enhance their um their visibility
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
and to respond to representative
 
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
o'hara's question um
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
these are not blinding led light strips
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
that would be on the hood of a jeep or a
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
truck so uh this is not something that
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
would heavily interfere um and be
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
blinding to oncoming traffic so there
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
are no
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
in our opinion there are no and i think
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
that hopefully the department of safety
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
would echo that as well there's no um
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
concerns there because they were
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
supportive of this effort last year as
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
well so
 
01:34:30.159 --> 01:34:30.950 align:start position:0%
well so
um

01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's it for for the lamping issue the
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
next thing i'll talk about is the
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
traffic safety commission um nhada is a
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
member of the traffic safety commission
 
01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
and we've sat on it i have for a number
 
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
of years we wholeheartedly support
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
having nhmro become a member a great
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
deal of our
 
01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.070 align:start position:0%
deal of our
discussions

01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh are around the accidents of
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
motorcycles accidents injuries and
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunate deaths
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
so having their voice be part of how can
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
we make the roadways safer especially
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
for for bikes and riders um our great
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
motorcycle tourist destination state um
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
having their voice uh on this commission
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
we think would be um incredibly
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
beneficial so um
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for hopefully your support on
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
this bill which um i think based on its
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
success last year hopefully is a pretty
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
easy one for you all
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
and um if there are any questions i'd be
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
glad to try and handle them
 
01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you i do see one question
 
01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh and thank you
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
i um i just had one is it uh is it your
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh contention that this bill would be
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
for the visibility of the
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
motorcycle operator or
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
the visibility of the motorcycle by the
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
traveling public
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's both um
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
it's both for the rider um you know i
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
think if you think about a a single
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
headlamp uh versus a headlamp and then
 
01:36:07.110 --> 01:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
two mounted lower uh you know on about a
 
01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
two to three inch spindle and then two
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
more down by their feet it's really just
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
going to enhance that
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
that field of vision for both oncoming
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
and the riders themselves so i'm not
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
sure if you all have the um
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
and hopefully you do have the images
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
that i sent over yesterday morning but i
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
think it makes it pretty clear um how it
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
the questions from the committee
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%

01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
have to raise my hand next time i just
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%

closely with the division of motor
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles and uh oftentimes we work very
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
closely with new hampshire automobile

today and we have worked with the new
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire honorable dealers in regards
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
to this bill this was something that
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
they brought to our attention where
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
there was a concern where motorcycles uh
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
in particular they have one headlight
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
and then oftentimes they come from the
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
manufacture you see it especially with
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
harley davidsons where there's two
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
auxiliary allowed two auxiliary lights
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
mounted to the left or right of the
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
headlight this precludes motorcycles
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
from being able to have additional
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
auxiliary lamps down low that can help
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
light the uh the sides of the roadways
 
01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.550 align:start position:0%
light the uh the sides of the roadways
so

01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's prohibited that they can't
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily see off to the sides where
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
there might be a small animal that's
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
going to dart out in front of them uh so
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
we worked with nhad to help craft the
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
language of this bill to add four
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
auxiliary lights specifically for the
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
purposes of motorcycles to help the uh
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
improve driver safety uh as a secondary
 
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
feature obviously it does help
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
motorcycles be seen by oncoming drivers
 
01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:16.950 align:start position:0%
motorcycles be seen by oncoming drivers
and

01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
the department safety supports this bill
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
461

01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
461
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative sites unless they're
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
trying to do this now but
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility if things go well
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
this afternoon perhaps we might be able
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
to get this uh
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
part of our uh executive session just
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
figured i could throw that out there
 
01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:01.270 align:start position:0%
figured i could throw that out there
so

01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
that being said uh
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
our next hearing
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
will be at 11 o'clock house bill 628 and
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
exercise good job getting your exercise
 
01:57:01.589 --> 01:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
can anybody hear me
 
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh let's open the public hearing on
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
house bill 628 fn
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
an act relative to maximum vehicle speed
 
01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:17.430 align:start position:0%
an act relative to maximum vehicle speed
limitations

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
is the prime sponsor
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh afternoon no good morning
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
i'm great i'm great
 
01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:34.229 align:start position:0%
i'm great i'm great
i

01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
i wanted to thank mr chairman and
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
distinguished members of the committee
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'm here to introduce and ask for
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
support of hb 628 which seeks to
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
increase the speed limit on certain new
 
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire roads
 
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is a result of a constituent
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
request the bill seeks to
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
increase the speeds on roads currently
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
55 miles an hour to 60 miles an hour and
 
01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:00.950 align:start position:0%
55 miles an hour to 60 miles an hour and
65

01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
65
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
mile an hour roads to 70 miles an hour
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
and a few sections of road currently uh
 
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
70 miles an hour to 75.
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
so just a five mile an hour increase on
 
01:58:11.679 --> 01:58:12.390 align:start position:0%
so just a five mile an hour increase on
uh

01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
those roads
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh if you have driven on uh
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
highways 90 uh 101 and 93 you're all
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
already fully aware that the flow of
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
traffic is is already 70 miles an hour
 
01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
and sometimes even 75 because motorists
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
naturally find a come comfortable speed
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
for the road over time unless it's
 
01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:38.070 align:start position:0%
for the road over time unless it's
artificially

01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
artificially
 
01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:39.030 align:start position:0%
artificially
uh

01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:40.870 align:start position:0%
uh
lowered

01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
lowered
 
01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:41.669 align:start position:0%
lowered
by

01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
speed limits that are strictly enforced
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
i believe that we should be um not be
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
sending out our officers to enforce uh
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
speed which is
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
significantly lower than most motorists
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
find to be comfortable for the road
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
that would increase
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
speed differentials
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
between those driving at a comfortable
 
01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:04.229 align:start position:0%
between those driving at a comfortable
speed

01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
speed
 
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
for the road and those driving to avoid
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
the long arm of the law

ramifications

01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
he quote we found that speed variations
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
and vehicle interactions have a direct
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
impact on highway safety unquote while
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
accidents at higher speeds
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
increase the likelihood of serious
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
injury in the crash i suggest that we
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
already have those conditions on the
 
01:59:38.639 --> 01:59:39.750 align:start position:0%
already have those conditions on the
ground

01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
ground
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
now where people are
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
driving the comfortable speed and um
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
those speed limits are not aligned uh
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
and so i hope that you'll support the
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
this uh change of speed limits to the
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
current flow
 
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh to more accurately reflect the
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
current flow of traffic on these roads
 
01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:00.550 align:start position:0%
current flow of traffic on these roads
so

02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
that we encourage everyone to move at
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
the same speed
 
02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:05.589 align:start position:0%
the same speed
if

02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
such a change needs to be worked into a
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
transportation plan and that's the
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
effective date of such legislation needs
 
02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
to be pushed out to accommodate that i
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
would support uh such an amendment
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and i will try to answer
 
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have
 
02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you uh
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative yapella for presenting
 
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
this today
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
my question is if you are to
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
if we are to raise the speed limits
 
02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:38.709 align:start position:0%
if we are to raise the speed limits
then

02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
how do you believe that will affect uh
 
02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:43.430 align:start position:0%
how do you believe that will affect uh
the

02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
traffic around work zone areas because
 
02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
then those speed limits also are raised
 
02:00:49.599 --> 02:00:50.550 align:start position:0%
then those speed limits also are raised
because

02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
i believe you have to slow down a
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
certain amount
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
around those speed limit around those
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
work areas but it would essentially
 
02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:01.589 align:start position:0%
work areas but it would essentially
raise

02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
raise
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
the speed limit around those areas as
 
02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:09.189 align:start position:0%
the speed limit around those areas as
well

02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:13.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
i

02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
am not
 
02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.669 align:start position:0%
am not
uh

02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not i think the best person to
 
02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
answer that question the ramifications
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
of what speed um
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
workers or highway workers
 
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
i've seen definitely multiple
 
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
speed speeds from 25 miles an hour next
 
02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:36.950 align:start position:0%
speed speeds from 25 miles an hour next
to

02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
next to workers to you know 55 miles an
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
hour next to workers so i'm not
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
what the ramifications are like how far
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
away from the
 
02:01:49.599 --> 02:01:50.390 align:start position:0%
away from the
people

02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
driving that they need to be for
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
increased speed
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera i'm not
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
sure of the ramifications of that so i'm
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
not sure i am the best person to answer
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:02.639 --> 02:02:06.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:02:07.679 --> 02:02:08.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious if um
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
in any of your research on this issue
 
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
if you raise the
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
speed limit by five miles per hour to
 
02:02:19.119 --> 02:02:20.390 align:start position:0%
speed limit by five miles per hour to
perhaps

02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
match up with what you're calling a
 
02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable driving speed that people
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
are doing anyway
 
02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
what's to prevent people from then going
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
another five miles per hour over because
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
they see it as that that window of what
 
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
is a comfortable flow of traffic which
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
would potentially put people at 80 miles
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
i think that there are some people that
 
02:02:49.270 --> 02:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
just want to push the
 
02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
the limits of what they can get away
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
with and that there are other people
 
02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
that just drive
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
at a speed that is
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
um comfortable for the for the road and
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
the terrain
 
02:03:02.239 --> 02:03:03.669 align:start position:0%
the terrain
and

02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
my my uh suggestion is that
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
that the current speed limit is even
 
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
below what people find comfortable not
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
um necessarily uh
 
02:03:18.629 --> 02:03:18.639 align:start position:0%
the people that are always trying to
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
push the boundaries those people are are
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to be pushing the boundaries no
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
matter what speed limit you put
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the question
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from the
 
02:03:30.719 --> 02:03:32.790 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from the
committee

02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%

i know i sent the committee a letter

i know i sent the committee a letter
yesterday

02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
regarding this issue
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
we are neutral on the bill we would
 
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
leave it up to the department of safety
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
safety wise of whether increasing the
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
speed limits is the right thing to do
 
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
our concern comes out of the unintended
 
02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:42.950 align:start position:0%
our concern comes out of the unintended
consequences

02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
relating to a different statute
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
statute 265 colon 60 deals with
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
kind of safety in the work zone and
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
highway workers
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
that are working on highways
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
right now that work zone has language
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
that says the reduction would be 10
 
02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
miles an hour or more
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
we know in in the practical world that
 
02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
d.o.t tries to design it to 10 miles an
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
hour under the speed limit
 
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
our concern comes over highway worker
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
safety and people in the roadways
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
and so i did attach to that position
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
paper some language that if you were to
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
we do not really want any changes in the
 
02:05:29.589 --> 02:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
speed limits so
 
02:05:32.070 --> 02:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
for anything i added language that would
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
allow that any highways 55 miles an hour
 
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
or over
 
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
instead of seeing a 10 mile an hour
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
reduction would see a 15.
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
so that's really where uh our group
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
i brought it up to the contractors i
 
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
represent large commercial contractors
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
who work on the highways and buildings
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
and clearly we just don't want to see
 
02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
any increase in work zone speed limits
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
so we really looked at the unintended
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
consequence of changing the speed limits
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
again we don't have a position on
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
whether the legislature you know what
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
speeds are set
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to
 
02:06:12.550 --> 02:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
our we're always working with the
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
department of transportation to try to
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
make sure our highways are as safe as
 
02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:18.390 align:start position:0%
make sure our highways are as safe as
possible

02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
but we would like to have that change if
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
the committee decides to move forward
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
with the bill and i would end my
 
02:06:26.070 --> 02:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and answer any questions you
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
may have
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:30.950 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
committee

02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
seeing that thank you again thank you

02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
recognize william lambert representing
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
department of transportation who
 
02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is bill lambert
 
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'm the state traffic engineer for the
 
02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of
 
02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:14.470 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of
transportation

02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
in that role i am also
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
granted the commissioners delegated a
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
delegated authority
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
uh for determining state speed zones on
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
rsa 265 62. i've had that authority
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
since 2013
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
prior to that that authority was uh was
 
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
granted to each of the the regional
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
district engineers in our highway
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance bureau
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from that point of time i
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
probably spent
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
30 to 40 percent of my
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
engineering time as state traffic
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
engineer dealing with concerns about
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
speed and speed limits um
 
02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
and i've been uh asked by the institute
 
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
of transportation engineers to
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
participate in a um
 
02:07:55.109 --> 02:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
developing a a um
 
02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
i guess a case study collective for best
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
management practices with regard to
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
setting speed limits uh i've also been
 
02:08:02.709 --> 02:08:02.719 align:start position:0%
involved with uh
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
ashto at the national level uh with
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
changes to the mutcd regarding speed
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
limits so
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
i do deal with speed limits quite a bit
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
and i did submit written testimony i
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
believe you folks have that uh on
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
written by the commissioner
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh i did i don't want to necessarily
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
read that but i did want to
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
go through some of the points that i
 
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
made in that letter one of the things
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we talk about is state speed zones
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
so state speed zones
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
the statutory speed limits are set in
 
02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:36.149 align:start position:0%
the statutory speed limits are set in
rsa26560

02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
rsa26560
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
and cities are allowed to alter those
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
speed statutory speed limits in rsa 265
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
63 and the commissioner of
 
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
transportation is all allowed to alter
 
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
those speed limits uh in rsa265 62. in
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
both cases
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
any changes are supposed to be based on
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
an engineering and traffic investigation
 
02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh in the last seven or eight years the
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
department of transportation has
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
developed a fairly robust
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
methodology for determining state speed
 
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
zones and very seldomly
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
do we change do we reduce speed limits
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
our study or recommendations uh in fact
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
we've raised several over the last
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
several years
 
02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
i can tell you some of our experience at
 
02:09:20.229 --> 02:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
wakefield route 153 working with and
 
02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
actually prompted by local police raised
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
the speed limit from 35 to 45.
 
02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
that was a road that was probably posted
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
at 35 in the 60s because of the winding
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
nature of the road with the premise that
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
people would slow down when they went
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
around the curves
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
studies showed over the years that they
 
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
didn't do that
 
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
so we work with the police chief and
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
then the rural sections of 153 increase
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
the speed limit
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
the cancer maintenance highway was
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
another example where we increased the
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
speed limit from 40 to 50 in the lincoln
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
livermore area based on speed studies
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
we also raised a speed limit on route 27
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
in candia in on route 4a in in wilmot
 
02:09:59.430 --> 02:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
based on engineering and traffic
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
investigations all of those came
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
with pretty broad support from the local
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
governing body not that they have that
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh authority um but it's it would be uh
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
disingenuous for us to make those kind
 
02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
of changes without reaching out to the
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
local governing body
 
02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
i also want to point out some places
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
where we did recommend speed limits be
 
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
increased based on the studies that got
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
rejected uh in reaching out to the local
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
governing body um
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
most folks would unders would think that
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
changing the speed limit is not a good
 
02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:30.069 align:start position:0%
changing the speed limit is not a good
idea

02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
idea
 
02:10:30.079 --> 02:10:31.189 align:start position:0%
idea
um

02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
and and we've
 
02:10:35.109 --> 02:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
tried to convince them otherwise and and
 
02:10:37.109 --> 02:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
given the reasoning for our recommended
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
changes but not always with success and
 
02:10:42.629 --> 02:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
one of those was uh the section of nh120
 
02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
from claremont to lebanon um which is at
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
several different speed limits over 18
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
to 20 miles uh we were recommending
 
02:10:53.109 --> 02:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
something that was more uniform
 
02:10:55.990 --> 02:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
but in three of the four communities
 
02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
that recommendation was not
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
um accepted although local governing
 
02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
bodies in two of the towns seemed to
 
02:11:04.149 --> 02:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
understand the reasoning behind it but
 
02:11:05.589 --> 02:11:05.599 align:start position:0%
they had some local
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
i guess pressure uh to not support it
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
so we didn't make that change in orford
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
and wentworth on route 25a uh
 
02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:15.109 align:start position:0%
and wentworth on route 25a uh
interestingly

02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
interestingly
 
02:11:17.109 --> 02:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh the town of wentworth supported
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
raising the speed limit from 40 to 50
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
but orford
 
02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
did not so that remains at the 40 miles
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%
an hour i also talked about some of the
 
02:11:27.189 --> 02:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
other features related to posted speed
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
limits and we we have recently completed
 
02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
or are completing the statewide project
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
to bring all of our horizontal alignment
 
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
warning signs
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
in line with the current standards and
 
02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
they're determined based on the
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
difference between a posted speed limit
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
and a measured advisory speed and the
 
02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
measured advisory speed is based on the
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
deflection of the vehicle as it goes
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
around a curve
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
and what we found over the in doing
 
02:11:52.870 --> 02:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
those projects that there are a number
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
of speed limits that are probably less
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
than what the prevailing speed is
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh so that we were taking away curve
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
warning signs uh when we thought they
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
um there should be more well we had a
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
history of some run off the road crashes
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
in an example using that wakefield
 
02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:09.589 align:start position:0%
in an example using that wakefield
example

02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
over 12 miles of changing the speed
 
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
limit by 10 miles an hour when we went
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
back and looked at the curve warning
 
02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
signs we found that we added something
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
like 200 new assets either chevron's
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
delineators or curve signs
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
the other one was the passing zones
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
where the passing site distances
 
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
determined based on the posted speed
 
02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
determined based on the posted speed
limit

02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
limit
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
and when we raised the speed limit on
 
02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
the tank 112 in lincoln and livermore
 
02:12:37.109 --> 02:12:37.119 align:start position:0%
um we ended up closing seven of eight
 
02:12:37.119 --> 02:12:38.069 align:start position:0%
um we ended up closing seven of eight
passing

02:12:38.069 --> 02:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
passing
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
zones that were on that stretch
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
because they did not meet the passing
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
sight distance required for 50 miles an
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
hour while they did for 40.
 
02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
and as far as the safety concerns that
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
this department has for for raising the
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
speed limits
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
on the lower speed highways like i
 
02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
talked about the 153 and wakefield and
 
02:12:58.950 --> 02:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
some of the other ones
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
research routinely demonstrates that
 
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
changing to the changes to the speed
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
limit do not
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
measurably affect the speed of traffic
 
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
because people find a comfortable speed
 
02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
based on the character and condition of
 
02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
the road
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
but the research does seem to indicate
 
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
that increasing the speed limits on the
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
higher order highways the ones that were
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
built for higher speeds with wide sight
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
distance flat curves and things like
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
that that the speed does tend to
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
to go up i know one of the questions
 
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
earlier was whether people would get
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable with a an increase an
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
additional five miles per hour increase
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
if the speed limit increased
 
02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
i would point that the speed limit north
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
of concord that went from 65 to 70
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
several years ago is being considered
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
for an additional five miles an hour
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
now and that would kind of be an
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
indication that that that previous
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
increase has resulted in a
 
02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
corresponding increase in the traffic i
 
02:13:53.679 --> 02:13:54.470 align:start position:0%
corresponding increase in the traffic i
can't

02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
can't
 
02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
i can't
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that with data we did do
 
02:13:58.950 --> 02:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
some before and after data or a year or
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
two after
 
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh and that was inconclusive but we
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
haven't gone back and collected that
 
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
data since
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
but the fact that it's being uh
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
recommended to be or proposed to be
 
02:14:09.669 --> 02:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
increased another five miles an hour
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
would be an indication
 
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
that there's at least a perception that
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
speeds have gone up
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
and while
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
this the data might be inconclusive as
 
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
to what
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
this might the the speeds might be on
 
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
the higher order highways
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh what's not inconclusive is that
 
02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
higher speeds result in higher
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
crash severity so with that i'd close my
 
02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:32.790 align:start position:0%
crash severity so with that i'd close my
testimony

02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
the department of transportation would
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
be opposed to this bill
 
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
so one question at this point
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
mr lambert for taking my question i i
 
02:14:49.990 --> 02:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually have a two-part question if the
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
chair will indulge me um the first part
 
02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:55.189 align:start position:0%
chair will indulge me um the first part
is

02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
is my memory correct that i had we had
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
learned during various testimonies that
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
design phase of the interstate highway
 
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
system was based on a
 
02:15:12.550 --> 02:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
i would have to look to make sure my
 
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
recollection from my time in the design
 
02:15:19.510 --> 02:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
office is that most of the interstate
 
02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:20.550 align:start position:0%
office is that most of the interstate
highway

02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
highway
 
02:15:23.350 --> 02:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
designs were the design speed was 70
 
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
miles an hour and as a kid growing up in
 
02:15:27.990 --> 02:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
the 60s and 70s i remember the posted
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
speed limit being 70 miles an hour
 
02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
on the interstate highways until the
 
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
energy crisis reduced it to
 
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay just and then part part two um
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
within your design work for these types
 
02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
of things um
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i'll be
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
frank about this i'm particularly
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
concerned about route 89 from concord to
 
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
the vermont border
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's a pretty short there's a
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
high increase in the elevation i think
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's almost 2000 feet in a very short
 
02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
and that means we get wildly different
 
02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:05.669 align:start position:0%
and that means we get wildly different
weather

02:16:05.669 --> 02:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
weather
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
within that very short time frame
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
distance frame
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:16:14.709 --> 02:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
the design questions about what speed
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
limits should be take into consideration
 
02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess i'd ask a follow-up and
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'd ask a
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up or clarification is what part
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
condition would would be considered for
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
for the design speed is it the elevation
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
change or or geometry within that
 
02:16:37.599 --> 02:16:38.790 align:start position:0%
change or or geometry within that
section

02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
well i wasn't thank you uh i'll try and
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
clarify sometimes my questions could be
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
a little convoluted um
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
my particular concern is that the a
 
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
couple of factors um
 
02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
ice on the roadway changes dramatically
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
from rain to ice on the roadway within
 
02:16:58.389 --> 02:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
with the elevation increase
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
the road may in fact be designed fine
 
02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
for geometry wise but it
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't take into consideration that
 
02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
those types of changes and then of
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
course there's a whole issue of rain me
 
02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
becoming snow
 
02:17:12.559 --> 02:17:13.509 align:start position:0%
becoming snow
and

02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
snow becoming a white out
 
02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh so i
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
that's where i'm coming from i'm very
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
very we see a lot of cars off the road
 
02:17:24.629 --> 02:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
within that uh
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
well north of warner and
 
02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
in the you know uh springfield area for
 
02:17:30.319 --> 02:17:31.669 align:start position:0%
in the you know uh springfield area for
instance

02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
instance
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
so i think i understand your question
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
now and and i would say that speed
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
limits are generally determined based on
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
ideal traffic and weather conditions so
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
blue sky daylight dry pavement
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
when we do the engineering and traffic
 
02:17:49.349 --> 02:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
investigation it includes a speed study
 
02:17:50.469 --> 02:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
and the speed study should be
 
02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
determining what the
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
prevailing speed is
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
during ideal weather conditions and the
 
02:17:59.030 --> 02:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
statute already says that
 
02:18:00.790 --> 02:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
drivers are expected to adjust their
 
02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:01.830 align:start position:0%
drivers are expected to adjust their
speed

02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
speed
 
02:18:03.429 --> 02:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
based on actual conditions the
 
02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable improvement standard or
 
02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable and safe standard
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
so if the department has over the last
 
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
probably 15 years or so as we've
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
invested in weather
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
weather data systems in our the
 
02:18:19.110 --> 02:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
changeable message signs and things like
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
that we have identified places like that
 
02:18:24.389 --> 02:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
section of 89 where we can collect
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
real-time pavement condition data and
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
put up messages
 
02:18:30.309 --> 02:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
for folks to remind them of the road
 
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
conditions so that they should slow down
 
02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:33.190 align:start position:0%
conditions so that they should slow down
we

02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
we've looked at trying to put a variable
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
speed limit sign so we'd actually change
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
the posted speed limit on those roads uh
 
02:18:41.429 --> 02:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
through the manchester the sale on the
 
02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
manchester project and the everett
 
02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:44.230 align:start position:0%
manchester project and the everett
turnpike

02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
turnpike
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
but we found that those
 
02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:46.870 align:start position:0%
but we found that those
systems

02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
communication wise and technology wise
 
02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:49.830 align:start position:0%
communication wise and technology wise
and

02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:51.669 --> 02:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
cost-wise can be
 
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
i guess cost prohibitive to install and
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
maintain so we tend to be using
 
02:18:58.309 --> 02:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
i guess our public outreach through the
 
02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
media and through
 
02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:01.030 align:start position:0%
media and through
our

02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
limited number of changeable method
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
science when we have those specific
 
02:19:04.399 --> 02:19:05.509 align:start position:0%
science when we have those specific
conditions

02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
02:19:07.349 --> 02:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
to remind people that
 
02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
they should be slowing down during the
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
weather and we have enough
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
granularity in our traffic or our
 
02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
weather data systems to be able to
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
identify the difference between say i-95
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
and in the portsmouth area in 93 in
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%
derry and ie9 i-89 in londonderry so we
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
try to manage that storm by storm in
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
case by case
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
lambert for taking my question
 
02:19:41.439 --> 02:19:42.230 align:start position:0%
lambert for taking my question
um

02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
just so i from what i hear you say um
 
02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
the department is
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
open to
 
02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
raising speed limits on certain roadways
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
when your
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
investigations studies
 
02:19:57.910 --> 02:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the local
 
02:19:57.920 --> 02:19:59.110 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the local
authorities

02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
direct you to that and the data shows it
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
but would you agree with me that you're
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
saying the blanket
 
02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
um raise of speed limits
 
02:20:13.270 --> 02:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
statewide um is just not the direct the
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
best way to go in this circumstance
 
02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and i i guess
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
i would clarify that that the department
 
02:20:21.120 --> 02:20:22.469 align:start position:0%
i would clarify that that the department
has

02:20:22.469 --> 02:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
i guess the legacy system of statewide
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
speed limits that i've inherited in 2013
 
02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
would have a a number of speed limits
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
that i think have been
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily lowered over the years where
 
02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
the standard for the engineering and
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
traffic investigation may not be as
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
robust as we've had it in the last
 
02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
ten or
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
seven or eight years
 
02:20:44.550 --> 02:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
so that being said i think that legacy
 
02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
system includes a number of examples
 
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
where the speed limit um is much less
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
than the prevailing speed may be more of
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
a desired speed and oftentimes the
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
request that we would get
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
would be from people that want it to be
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
less than what they think is reasonable
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
and safe so that they can start
 
02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
ticketing people at that at that
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable and safe number
 
02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:03.750 align:start position:0%
reasonable and safe number
um

02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:06.870 --> 02:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
and that's not really good practice so
 
02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
um the the ones that i think that would
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
be real considering increase would be
 
02:21:13.030 --> 02:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
some of those legacy systems that maybe
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
were inappropriately reduced in the past
 
02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:17.510 align:start position:0%
were inappropriately reduced in the past
um

02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
that being said i think the data shows
 
02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
that when you increase speed limits on
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
those higher order highways the
 
02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
interstates and the the turnpikes and
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
those multi-lane divided highways that
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
were built to a higher standard
 
02:21:30.870 --> 02:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
does tend to
 
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
result in higher speeds and higher
 
02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
speeds then result in
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh increased
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
severity of crashes
 
02:21:40.230 --> 02:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
i guess as an example is when the speed
 
02:21:41.590 --> 02:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
limit was reached
 
02:21:42.469 --> 02:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
was hoping that state police would be on
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
this call
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
but my understanding when the speed
 
02:21:48.389 --> 02:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
limit was increased north of concord
 
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
from 65 to 70
 
02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
that there was
 
02:21:53.429 --> 02:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
a corresponding increase in the
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
tolerance for doing enforcement and that
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
really wasn't the intent or the stated
 
02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:59.030 align:start position:0%
really wasn't the intent or the stated
intent

02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
intent
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh if the intent was to stop pulling
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
people over at 75 before the speed limit
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
was raised
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
then arguably that
 
02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
that 75 would have still been the upper
 
02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
limit after the speed limit was raised
 
02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to think that's not the case
 
02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
but sometimes it has to do with um
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
enforcing or convicting people in the
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
courts and what the courts will accept
 
02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:20.309 align:start position:0%
courts and what the courts will accept
as

02:22:20.309 --> 02:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
as a um acceptable reasonable and safe
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
speed and one of the other things about
 
02:22:27.190 --> 02:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
the interstate speeds it's different in
 
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
the statute that people don't understand
 
02:22:30.309 --> 02:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
the 65 or 70 that's in the statute now
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
is a per se
 
02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
speed limit not a prima prime of fascist
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
speed limit
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
so by law
 
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
any speed over that 75 or 65 or 70
 
02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's in the statute is is a violation
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
where people could argue on the primo
 
02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
fascia standard
 
02:22:50.479 --> 02:22:51.190 align:start position:0%
fascia standard
that

02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
during certain conditions higher speed
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
may be acceptable
 
02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
mr lambert had better questions we
 
02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
talked about 93
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
when we did legislatively increase the
 
02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
speed limit from 65 to 70 on the
 
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
northern portions of 93.
 
02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
part of the conversation before we
 
02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
raised any more
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
and the understanding was that the
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
average it takes about five years
 
02:23:25.349 --> 02:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
of study when you make such a change to
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
find out if there's really any adverse
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
effects from from the change
 
02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
two-part question how fresh my memory
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
how long has it been since we did that
 
02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:36.230 align:start position:0%
how long has it been since we did that
and

02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
is there any data available
 
02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:39.670 align:start position:0%
is there any data available
showing

02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
showing
 
02:23:41.429 --> 02:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
any change
 
02:23:45.270 --> 02:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question mr chairman
 
02:23:47.359 --> 02:23:48.230 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question mr chairman
um

02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
i could find out pretty easily when the
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
change was done i i want to say it was
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
2013 or 14 time frame um
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
i don't want to start digging into files
 
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
now because
 
02:24:00.389 --> 02:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
it might take a little a minute but it
 
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
it was at that time frame and i remember
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
the year following that change there was
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
a a bill to increase
 
02:24:08.309 --> 02:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
the speed limit i think on 89 and maybe
 
02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
101 to that same 70 and at the time we
 
02:24:13.750 --> 02:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
testified that it would be good to give
 
02:24:15.429 --> 02:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
us some time to determine if
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
that had changed
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
as i said we did a before and after
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
study one year before and one year after
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
so we've got data but the data is not
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
what i would call robust
 
02:24:27.110 --> 02:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
research data because it was only on
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
those points north of concord we didn't
 
02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
have any control on other highways to
 
02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
see if there was a corresponding
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
change and in the data that we did
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
collect north of concord in that
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
following year
 
02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
it looked like there was
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
one section north of franconia notch
 
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
where the speeds increased by about five
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
miles an hour
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
but on everything else in that first
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
year there wasn't
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a significant increase it
 
02:24:53.110 --> 02:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
was uh it was rarely less than the
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
previous speed but it was never more
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
than one or two miles an hour over what
 
02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
was previously recorded but again those
 
02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:00.469 align:start position:0%
was previously recorded but again those
are

02:25:00.469 --> 02:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
point in time they're not necessarily
 
02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
robust data over over an extended period
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing that we wanted to
 
02:25:09.429 --> 02:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
follow up with was crash volume and
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
crash severity and that data is harder
 
02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:12.710 align:start position:0%
crash severity and that data is harder
for

02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
i don't manage it so i can't necessarily
 
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
comment on that but my understanding is
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
that the crash data is
 
02:25:21.270 --> 02:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
is inconclusive because
 
02:25:23.349 --> 02:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
over the years we get more of a
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
percentage of crashes in what we capture
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
in the data so
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
the the increase in the volume may be a
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
reflection of just having better records
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
than an increase in crashes so it's hard
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
to tell if that changed and again that
 
02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
would be somebody else that would have
 
02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
to comment on that
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:44.230 --> 02:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
i guess while i'm just getting at what
 
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned the crash
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
and the crash severity i guess that's
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
the important information if there's
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
anything you can find on that and share
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
it that'd be fantastic
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
i see representative cleaver with his
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note lists uh some 700 signs
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
and a cost of 178 000
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
to make the changes
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
so the first part of the question is do
 
02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
you agree with those numbers
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
the second part of the question is that
 
02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
the law says the bill says
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
60 days to change out all the signs
 
02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if you thought that
 
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh i put
 
02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
together the fiscal note so i guess i'm
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
gonna have to say that i do agree with
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
it um
 
02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
i didn't have any precise data to do it
 
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
based on some assumptions that i
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
included in the fiscal note but i was
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
fairly comfortable with that
 
02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and as far as the taken effect after
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
60 days when the speed limit was
 
02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
increased north of concord
 
02:26:53.349 --> 02:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
um we made that change pretty much in
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
one day we took all of our sign crews
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
and and essentially just riveted on
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
overlay panels on existing signs it
 
02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
might have been one or two that we we
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
changed the entire sign out
 
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
but it was something that we were able
 
02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
to do um in that one day time period but
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
i would note that that last change took
 
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
effect on january 1st
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh so we ended up paying time and a half
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
holiday pay to do something that we
 
02:27:21.270 --> 02:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
probably could have done on january 2nd
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
for um for straight time and actually if
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
i remember right i made the executive
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
decision to wait until that uh that
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
second day so that we weren't paying the
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
time and a half so i would keep that in
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh one more we do have other people that
 
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
speak representative
 
02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm sorry i just noticed one
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
thing representative clieber brought my
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
attention to it mr lambert when i was
 
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
looking reading the fiscal note
 
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
i had underlined
 
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
um the part that said the evaluations
 
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
that for um tapers guardrails guardrail
 
02:27:58.870 --> 02:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
limits etc the evaluation will require
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
significant engineering study and the
 
02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
results will likely include
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
more warning signs needed fewer passing
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
zones more guardrail
 
02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
is the time that's needed for that and
 
02:28:11.270 --> 02:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
the expenses for that included in that
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
178 000 or the 178 000 is just the sign
 
02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:16.389 align:start position:0%
178 000 or the 178 000 is just the sign
changes

02:28:16.389 --> 02:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:28:18.150 --> 02:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question that's
 
02:28:20.790 --> 02:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
just the speed limit sign changes
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
the changing and horizontal alignment
 
02:28:22.319 --> 02:28:23.429 align:start position:0%
the changing and horizontal alignment
signing

02:28:23.429 --> 02:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
signing
 
02:28:25.110 --> 02:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be that
 
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
significant on the divided highways
 
02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
because they
 
02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
probably would were designed for that
 
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
kind of speed
 
02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
but it may be more significant on the
 
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
roads that are posted at 55 that would
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
then be 60.
 
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:38.830 align:start position:0%
then be 60.
thank

02:28:38.830 --> 02:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:40.389 align:start position:0%
thank
you

02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
further questions mr lambert
 
02:28:45.429 --> 02:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
see amen thank you very much
 
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:51.270 --> 02:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative i see a full list of
 
02:28:51.280 --> 02:29:02.630 align:start position:0%
okay representative i see a full list of
attendees

02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
i agree i see no hands right now
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
of all the people there would anybody
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
wish to speak
 
02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:16.469 --> 02:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
let's see it none
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:25.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
you can never win with these things i
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
hope representative sykes
 
02:29:30.790 --> 02:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
agrees with me it gives me that that
 
02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
courtesy you do your best when you try
 
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
to estimate the amount of time these
 
02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:42.469 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
that being said we do have
 
02:29:47.830 --> 02:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
a little better than normal lunch
 
02:29:49.349 --> 02:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
our next public hearing will be at one
 
02:29:51.910 --> 02:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
o'clock that is
 
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
hospital 522 and then we'll have an
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
afternoon of executive session so
 
03:49:47.110 --> 03:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:47.120 --> 03:55:35.670 align:start position:0%
 
do

03:55:35.670 --> 03:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:48.630 --> 03:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:48.640 --> 03:55:50.150 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:55:50.150 --> 03:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:09.030 --> 03:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative fox is having trouble
 
03:56:13.429 --> 03:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
logging in again i don't know if um
 
03:56:15.349 --> 03:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
brad can send her a new link
 
03:56:16.950 --> 03:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
i will resend it to her thank you for
 
03:56:36.150 --> 03:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:27.910 --> 03:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
so this is if you have a new car that's
 
03:57:32.150 --> 03:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
under warranty that you only have to get
 
03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
inspected every two years
 
03:57:36.710 --> 03:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
and when is it considered not new
 
03:57:36.720 --> 03:57:39.349 align:start position:0%
and when is it considered not new
anymore

03:57:39.349 --> 03:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:41.590 --> 03:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
well for the language of the bills once
 
03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
the warranty is over okay it's over now
 
03:57:45.590 --> 03:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
you have to go back to one year it's
 
03:58:01.429 --> 03:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:03.510 --> 03:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
now representative fox is not on yet i
 
03:58:08.469 --> 03:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:10.950 --> 03:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
i did just uh resend her zoom link to
 
03:58:12.710 --> 03:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
her so hopefully she'll be able to get
 
03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:38.389 --> 03:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:56.790 --> 03:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:56.800 --> 03:59:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
thank

03:59:18.790 --> 03:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:18.800 --> 03:59:39.189 align:start position:0%

04:00:10.479 --> 04:00:13.429 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsors you heard of this
legislation

04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:16.469 --> 04:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to testify on
 
04:00:17.990 --> 04:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
behalf of this
 
04:00:19.510 --> 04:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
04:00:21.910 --> 04:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
asking you to consider
 
04:00:24.710 --> 04:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty simple bill let me back up
 
04:00:30.389 --> 04:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
and say for those few in here at home
 
04:00:31.990 --> 04:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
members at home
 
04:00:33.189 --> 04:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
that were on the committee you know
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
you've heard various
 
04:00:38.229 --> 04:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
iterations of uh vehicle inspection
 
04:00:38.239 --> 04:00:39.830 align:start position:0%
iterations of uh vehicle inspection
sticker

04:00:39.830 --> 04:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
sticker
 
04:00:39.840 --> 04:00:40.790 align:start position:0%
sticker
and

04:00:40.790 --> 04:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:42.309 --> 04:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
requirements from getting rid of them
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
completely to
 
04:00:45.510 --> 04:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
changing the frequency
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
so mine's pretty simple and and
 
04:00:49.590 --> 04:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go into a little bit of
 
04:00:51.429 --> 04:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
background on on what it
 
04:00:51.439 --> 04:00:52.150 align:start position:0%
background on on what it
it

04:00:52.150 --> 04:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:00:53.830 --> 04:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
hopes to do
 
04:00:56.309 --> 04:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
it only affects new vehicles
 
04:00:59.349 --> 04:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
that are on a new vehicle warranty
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
so if you buy a new vehicle with some
 
04:01:03.910 --> 04:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
warranty it changes the frequency of
 
04:01:06.630 --> 04:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
inspection from one year to two years
 
04:01:08.790 --> 04:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
only while it's on warranty once it's
 
04:01:10.870 --> 04:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
our warranty it reverts back to the
 
04:01:13.830 --> 04:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
to put this in context that's currently
 
04:01:18.710 --> 04:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
in the country nine states that have no
 
04:01:21.030 --> 04:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
inspections at all
 
04:01:23.830 --> 04:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
and some of those states
 
04:01:23.840 --> 04:01:24.630 align:start position:0%
and some of those states
have

04:01:24.630 --> 04:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:01:27.030 --> 04:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
significantly bad winter weather
 
04:01:29.670 --> 04:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
for example alaska minnesota
 
04:01:32.950 --> 04:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
montana michigan in iowa or states that
 
04:01:34.950 --> 04:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
have no inspection at all
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
we're not i'm not attempting to do that
 
04:01:38.469 --> 04:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
what i am attempting to do is
 
04:01:40.150 --> 04:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of relief for new
 
04:01:41.910 --> 04:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle owners
 
04:01:41.920 --> 04:01:42.630 align:start position:0%
vehicle owners
to

04:01:42.630 --> 04:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:01:45.189 --> 04:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
to go to a longer
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
time between inspections
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
this fifth is about half the 50 states
 
04:01:52.469 --> 04:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
where the frequency of inspection is two
 
04:01:54.389 --> 04:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
years or longer many of those are three
 
04:01:56.309 --> 04:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
years longer the state of new jersey
 
04:01:59.189 --> 04:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
which isn't known to be a
 
04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
state that has less regulation than new
 
04:02:03.830 --> 04:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire new vehicles in
 
04:02:05.590 --> 04:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
new jersey get five years before they
 
04:02:08.070 --> 04:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
inspect them at all
 
04:02:08.080 --> 04:02:09.510 align:start position:0%
inspect them at all
so

04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:11.349 --> 04:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
you might ask yourself well you know why
 
04:02:13.510 --> 04:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
bother with this well because i think
 
04:02:15.269 --> 04:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
it's a common sense
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
way to give some relief in what does
 
04:02:18.389 --> 04:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
that do
 
04:02:20.229 --> 04:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
that helps people
 
04:02:21.990 --> 04:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
it gives a little incentive to buy new
 
04:02:22.000 --> 04:02:23.030 align:start position:0%
it gives a little incentive to buy new
vehicles

04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
04:02:25.590 --> 04:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
new vehicles are safer they're cleaner
 
04:02:27.510 --> 04:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
from the emissions point of view
 
04:02:29.429 --> 04:02:29.439 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
04:02:31.910 --> 04:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know state-of-the-art sensors
 
04:02:33.110 --> 04:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
the driver slash owner of the vehicle
 
04:02:37.269 --> 04:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
knows what's going on with the vehicle
 
04:02:39.670 --> 04:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
if there's a problem with the emissions
 
04:02:40.870 --> 04:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a light that's
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to show that if there's a
 
04:02:44.870 --> 04:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
problem with the vehicle requiring
 
04:02:46.550 --> 04:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
maintenance there's sensors that are
 
04:02:48.309 --> 04:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
going to indicate that as well
 
04:02:48.319 --> 04:02:50.469 align:start position:0%
going to indicate that as well
so

04:02:50.469 --> 04:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
there's virtually no risk doing this
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
because these vehicles are new they're
 
04:02:58.630 --> 04:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
they're the technology is better than a
 
04:03:00.630 --> 04:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
vehicle that's 10 years old
 
04:03:02.870 --> 04:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
many of these vehicles today when you
 
04:03:06.630 --> 04:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
buy a new vehicle
 
04:03:10.150 --> 04:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
the dealer or the manufacturer provides
 
04:03:11.670 --> 04:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
up to three years something you can go
 
04:03:13.590 --> 04:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
to five years i don't know
 
04:03:14.790 --> 04:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't name the ones that are doing
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
that these days of maintenance routine
 
04:03:18.630 --> 04:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance so it's not like the
 
04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
dealership or
 
04:03:21.269 --> 04:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
is gonna lose out on the service
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
business because
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to come back because it's
 
04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
on warranty to have them do that
 
04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
service anyway
 
04:03:32.229 --> 04:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
so with that um
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple bill i hope you
 
04:03:35.590 --> 04:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
consider it it's this is this is the
 
04:03:35.600 --> 04:03:37.030 align:start position:0%
consider it it's this is this is the
most

04:03:37.030 --> 04:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
most
 
04:03:39.510 --> 04:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
common sense in my opinion
 
04:03:41.189 --> 04:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
change of um
 
04:03:43.189 --> 04:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
inspection frequency that's come before
 
04:03:44.309 --> 04:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
and you know i want to point out one
 
04:03:48.070 --> 04:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
other thing that i failed to mention
 
04:03:50.469 --> 04:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
in the 1980s
 
04:03:52.389 --> 04:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was twice a year
 
04:03:52.399 --> 04:03:53.590 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was twice a year
inspection

04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of cry about if we
 
04:03:58.389 --> 04:03:58.399 align:start position:0%
do that the you know
 
04:04:00.070 --> 04:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
safety's gonna suffer and there's gonna
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
be all kinds of
 
04:04:03.830 --> 04:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
accidents and problems it never happened
 
04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
but again that went from six months to
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
one year the trend in the country is to
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
go to longer frequencies or get rid of
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
stickers because um vehicles are more
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
reliable so this is a very very minimal
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
change that i hope you can support and
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
with that i'll open
 
04:04:17.520 --> 04:04:18.790 align:start position:0%
with that i'll open
uh

04:04:18.790 --> 04:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:20.229 --> 04:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
up to anybody that committed may have
 
04:04:21.910 --> 04:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
some questions
 
04:04:23.910 --> 04:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:04:25.110 --> 04:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
well thank you so i don't even have to
 
04:04:27.910 --> 04:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
ask representatives
 
04:04:29.110 --> 04:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative trojan
 
04:04:32.229 --> 04:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
um i do
 
04:04:34.710 --> 04:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
have a question about the
 
04:04:36.550 --> 04:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
having it be under warranty i know
 
04:04:39.189 --> 04:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers warranties differ
 
04:04:41.510 --> 04:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
across the board of
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
30 000 miles to 100 000 miles and
 
04:04:46.469 --> 04:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
everywhere in between how is the dmv
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
going to know what each manufacturer's
 
04:04:51.429 --> 04:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
warranty is for each vehicle to know
 
04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
that if they qualify
 
04:04:55.590 --> 04:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
04:04:55.600 --> 04:04:56.550 align:start position:0%
under this bill
okay

04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:04:56.560 --> 04:04:57.990 align:start position:0%
okay
well

04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:04:59.830 --> 04:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
that is something that when you buy a
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
new vehicle the manufacturer supplies
 
04:05:03.359 --> 04:05:04.229 align:start position:0%
new vehicle the manufacturer supplies
that

04:05:04.229 --> 04:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
document that shows what the warranty of
 
04:05:06.950 --> 04:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
the vehicle is
 
04:05:09.269 --> 04:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
so that's that's very obtainable
 
04:05:10.710 --> 04:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
from everybody
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
to to the dealerships to the owner of
 
04:05:14.950 --> 04:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
the vehicle and
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
certainly the dmv can get a copy of that
 
04:05:17.830 --> 04:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's not a
 
04:05:19.349 --> 04:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
difficult thing to
 
04:05:19.359 --> 04:05:23.189 align:start position:0%
difficult thing to
ascertain

04:05:23.189 --> 04:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:26.309 --> 04:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um my only other
 
04:05:31.429 --> 04:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
concern would be the um
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of the verbiage is just the
 
04:05:36.389 --> 04:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
term new vehicle um i'm wondering
 
04:05:38.309 --> 04:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
how that can actually be defined because
 
04:05:40.950 --> 04:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
a new vehicle for all of us could have
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
different definitions um i've bought a
 
04:05:45.750 --> 04:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
what i called a brand new vehicle but it
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
still had um you know 300 miles on it
 
04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
because they had to drive it up from
 
04:05:51.910 --> 04:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
connecticut or for example someone who
 
04:05:53.670 --> 04:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
bought um
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
a tester vehicle that
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
a dealership used maybe for six months
 
04:06:02.150 --> 04:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
um do you think there's a need to
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
be a little more specific in what a new
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle is or am i just um not a car
 
04:06:06.960 --> 04:06:07.830 align:start position:0%
vehicle is or am i just um not a car
person

04:06:07.830 --> 04:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
that um i'm asking this question in the
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
first place
 
04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
so um you know if the committee had the
 
04:06:15.750 --> 04:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
you wanted to strike that out they could
 
04:06:18.229 --> 04:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
do that um
 
04:06:19.429 --> 04:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
if you read
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
the the rest of the the change of the
 
04:06:22.239 --> 04:06:23.429 align:start position:0%
the the rest of the the change of the
cartoon

04:06:23.429 --> 04:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
cartoon
 
04:06:25.510 --> 04:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
it says any new vehicle that is under
 
04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
warranty and home owned by a natural
 
04:06:29.429 --> 04:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
person and registered under this title
 
04:06:29.439 --> 04:06:31.590 align:start position:0%
person and registered under this title
so

04:06:31.590 --> 04:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:33.429 --> 04:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
any vehicle that's still on the
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
the new car warranty would be eligible
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
to go to the two-year
 
04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
inspection and let me point out because
 
04:06:42.790 --> 04:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't for anybody that may not
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
know this is for
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
an individual a private vehicle um
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles
 
04:06:51.510 --> 04:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
you if you look at the verbiage vertical
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
aircraft you may remember that passing
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
that last term
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
um in other
 
04:06:57.510 --> 04:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are that aren't private
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
would still be one year so it's just for
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are used privately
 
04:07:06.150 --> 04:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:08.070 --> 04:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
i hope i answered the question
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:14.790 --> 04:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative trojan for taking my
 
04:07:16.880 --> 04:07:17.990 align:start position:0%
representative trojan for taking my
question

04:07:17.990 --> 04:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
what about new vehicles um
 
04:07:24.070 --> 04:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh that are purchased and the extended
 
04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's warranty is purchased
 
04:07:27.110 --> 04:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
with them
 
04:07:29.590 --> 04:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
i have a 10-year uh
 
04:07:29.600 --> 04:07:30.870 align:start position:0%
i have a 10-year uh
optional

04:07:30.870 --> 04:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
optional
 
04:07:32.870 --> 04:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's warranty that i purchased
 
04:07:38.150 --> 04:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
with my new vehicle so with that um
 
04:07:40.469 --> 04:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't would in essence would i be
 
04:07:42.070 --> 04:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
able to just
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
inspect my car every two years for the
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
duration of the warranty
 
04:07:49.510 --> 04:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
no no this is the intent here is in the
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't say manufacturers
 
04:07:52.950 --> 04:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
have passed actually added that were had
 
04:07:54.790 --> 04:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
that word added but this the intent of
 
04:07:54.800 --> 04:07:55.590 align:start position:0%
that word added but this the intent of
this

04:07:55.590 --> 04:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is to
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
apply to vehicles with the
 
04:08:00.640 --> 04:08:01.830 align:start position:0%
apply to vehicles with the
issued

04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
issued
 
04:08:05.349 --> 04:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh manufacturer's warranty
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes i understand that but i i
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
believe the question will be raised
 
04:08:14.880 --> 04:08:17.189 align:start position:0%
believe the question will be raised
um

04:08:17.189 --> 04:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:19.269 --> 04:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
without some certain terminology or
 
04:08:19.279 --> 04:08:20.710 align:start position:0%
without some certain terminology or
language

04:08:20.710 --> 04:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
well i'd be glad
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
or if the committee would be
 
04:08:27.030 --> 04:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
would um you know entertain changing it
 
04:08:28.950 --> 04:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
so that we put one word in there that is
 
04:08:28.960 --> 04:08:29.750 align:start position:0%
so that we put one word in there that is
under

04:08:29.750 --> 04:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:08:33.990 --> 04:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:34.870 --> 04:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:38.070 --> 04:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:08:40.630 --> 04:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representation
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you okay as i look into this as we
 
04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.550 --> 04:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
eight people signed up in a dance to
 
04:08:56.319 --> 04:08:57.750 align:start position:0%
eight people signed up in a dance to
testify

04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
testify
 
04:09:02.790 --> 04:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
and i also have 28 to 10 knees
 
04:09:04.870 --> 04:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
possibility of many more than what i
 
04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
have to testify
 
04:09:07.990 --> 04:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
is real
 
04:09:10.389 --> 04:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to leave it uh testimony to
 
04:09:19.110 --> 04:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:19.120 --> 04:09:20.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:09:20.070 --> 04:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
that you would recognize
 
04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh scott welsh uh
 
04:09:26.150 --> 04:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
presenting himself in opposition to the
 
04:09:26.160 --> 04:09:33.750 align:start position:0%

04:09:35.990 --> 04:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
i am not seeing him if he could raise
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
his hand
 
04:09:41.429 --> 04:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:47.269 --> 04:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
back to him
 
04:09:49.920 --> 04:09:49.930 align:start position:0%
one more shot at the end

can you hear me

04:10:49.349 --> 04:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
and i i would just like to say that you
 
04:10:49.359 --> 04:10:50.229 align:start position:0%
and i i would just like to say that you
know

04:10:50.229 --> 04:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:10:52.630 --> 04:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
in some instances on these
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
manufacturers warranties some of them
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
are as far as
 
04:10:58.870 --> 04:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
10 years 100 000 miles
 
04:11:01.590 --> 04:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
which makes it kind of difficult
 
04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
to ascertain
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
how long it's uh actually going to be
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
every two years for that car that's
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
number one and the other thing is some
 
04:11:12.950 --> 04:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
of these cars
 
04:11:15.030 --> 04:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have sensors that tell you
 
04:11:17.670 --> 04:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
when the tires are worn out and in this
 
04:11:20.309 --> 04:11:20.319 align:start position:0%
busy world today many people will jump
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
into their car to drive
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
and actually
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
have bald tires on the car and have no
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
idea that their tires are ball
 
04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
a similar thing that
 
04:11:33.990 --> 04:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
sensors aren't involved something simple
 
04:11:36.950 --> 04:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
like wiper blades where nobody knows
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
that they're bad because we have a long
 
04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
stretch of dry weather and then when you
 
04:11:42.790 --> 04:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
go to use them they're actually
 
04:11:45.349 --> 04:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
dangerous for driving these are just a
 
04:11:46.950 --> 04:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
couple of the things that come to mind
 
04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
for me having been in the business over
 
04:11:51.030 --> 04:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
45 years
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
that we see on a
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
constant basis
 
04:11:54.560 --> 04:11:55.349 align:start position:0%
constant basis
and

04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:56.550 --> 04:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
having a state inspection every year is
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
a lot less painful than going to
 
04:12:01.199 --> 04:12:05.830 align:start position:0%
a lot less painful than going to
funerals

04:12:05.830 --> 04:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:07.110 --> 04:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you sir if you want to take any
 
04:12:09.429 --> 04:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
04:12:09.439 --> 04:12:11.349 align:start position:0%
questions or
sure

04:12:11.349 --> 04:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:12:13.990 --> 04:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
04:12:16.630 --> 04:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
i see none thank you very much sir

i've inspected thousands and thousands
 
04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
of vehicles
 
04:14:37.359 --> 04:14:38.710 align:start position:0%
of vehicles
um

04:14:38.710 --> 04:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:41.429 --> 04:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
so i got a couple footnotes here um
 
04:14:44.550 --> 04:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
one big thing um
 
04:14:47.030 --> 04:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
we have vehicles coming in with 15 000
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
miles on them um
 
04:14:49.040 --> 04:14:51.110 align:start position:0%
miles on them um
particular

04:14:51.110 --> 04:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:14:54.070 --> 04:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
michelin primacy tire that is wearing
 
04:14:56.630 --> 04:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
down to cords prematurely and it turned
 
04:14:57.910 --> 04:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
out that there was a manufacturing
 
04:14:57.920 --> 04:14:58.950 align:start position:0%
out that there was a manufacturing
defect

04:14:58.950 --> 04:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
defect
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
where they were
 
04:15:02.710 --> 04:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
using too soft of a compound
 
04:15:05.110 --> 04:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
and we literally have hundreds of these
 
04:15:07.269 --> 04:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
vehicles coming in
 
04:15:08.870 --> 04:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
customers just aren't even aware of it
 
04:15:11.030 --> 04:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
until we say something
 
04:15:12.550 --> 04:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
but they're coming through and snow
 
04:15:15.670 --> 04:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
storms and whatnot with bald tires
 
04:15:16.950 --> 04:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
and they're just definitely not making
 
04:15:20.389 --> 04:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
we see vehicles that sit
 
04:15:24.790 --> 04:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
where the brakes will
 
04:15:26.710 --> 04:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
rust up and get stuck and then they'll
 
04:15:28.870 --> 04:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
drag and they'll wear down and the
 
04:15:31.349 --> 04:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
brakes will basically be non-existent
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
you know at
 
04:15:37.830 --> 04:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:40.950 --> 04:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
we've had things like axle seals
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
cv boots that are
 
04:15:45.750 --> 04:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
leaking or damaged that can spray
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
lubricant onto the braking surfaces
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
obviously that's uh you know a huge
 
04:15:50.399 --> 04:15:53.670 align:start position:0%
obviously that's uh you know a huge
factor

04:15:53.670 --> 04:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:55.670 --> 04:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know people people get in accidents
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
and they can have
 
04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
bumper covers that aren't secure or
 
04:16:01.910 --> 04:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
mirrors that are have sharp jagged edges
 
04:16:03.269 --> 04:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
and you know somebody
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
walking around that vehicle in a parking
 
04:16:07.110 --> 04:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
lot might might get caught on that you
 
04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
know get cut or get their clothes caught
 
04:16:12.830 --> 04:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:14.950 --> 04:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
um we got
 
04:16:16.870 --> 04:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
modified vehicles um
 
04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
people with uh you know tinted windows
 
04:16:19.840 --> 04:16:21.429 align:start position:0%
people with uh you know tinted windows
um

04:16:21.429 --> 04:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:22.389 --> 04:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know if
 
04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
we get customers that bring vehicles in
 
04:16:25.830 --> 04:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
that have their window uh windows on
 
04:16:28.790 --> 04:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
both sides and their windshield tinted
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
and if you try driving one of these
 
04:16:32.229 --> 04:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles when it's raining or snowing or
 
04:16:34.469 --> 04:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
nighttime you can't see anything at all
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i really don't want somebody like
 
04:16:37.349 --> 04:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
that driving
 
04:16:41.349 --> 04:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
also people put on you know aftermarket
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
light bars um where they're just
 
04:16:46.710 --> 04:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
blinding other drivers um they got wide
 
04:16:48.149 --> 04:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
tires that are sticking out past the
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
fenders so
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
stones and debris can get kicked up and
 
04:16:53.670 --> 04:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
crack windshields and windshields
 
04:16:54.950 --> 04:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's another thing right there that's
 
04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
something that has nothing to do with
 
04:16:57.990 --> 04:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
the factory warranty
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
they can be broken they can be cracked
 
04:17:00.960 --> 04:17:02.469 align:start position:0%
they can be broken they can be cracked
now

04:17:02.469 --> 04:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:17:06.149 --> 04:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle owners out there there's some
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
people that
 
04:17:10.070 --> 04:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
nitpick about every little thing and
 
04:17:11.269 --> 04:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
then there's other people that just
 
04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
can't be bothered and they don't have
 
04:17:14.070 --> 04:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
the time
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
to address anything and um
 
04:17:17.910 --> 04:17:17.920 align:start position:0%

04:17:20.229 --> 04:17:20.239 align:start position:0%

to know
 
04:17:52.149 --> 04:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
um especially since you mentioned those
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
michelin tires
 
04:17:56.149 --> 04:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
do you ever do these inspections and
 
04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
then report problems to manufacturers
 
04:18:01.189 --> 04:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
prompting a recall
 
04:18:03.670 --> 04:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
like if you see something coming in on a
 
04:18:06.550 --> 04:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
regular basis some problem uh as a
 
04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
result of these infections did you ever
 
04:18:12.389 --> 04:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
report those to the manufacturer
 
04:18:14.229 --> 04:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's called a field product
 
04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
report and our dealership is actually
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized for being one of
 
04:18:19.269 --> 04:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
the most
 
04:18:21.429 --> 04:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
top contributors to that anything that
 
04:18:23.189 --> 04:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
we see any type of pattern about we will
 
04:18:23.199 --> 04:18:24.389 align:start position:0%
we see any type of pattern about we will
certainly

04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:18:24.399 --> 04:18:25.510 align:start position:0%
certainly
um

04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:27.429 --> 04:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
you know notify the manufacturer we send
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
them pictures we send them documentation
 
04:18:31.510 --> 04:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
we send them everything we can get
 
04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
and absolutely the manufacturer will
 
04:18:37.830 --> 04:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
take note of this and investigate it and
 
04:18:41.269 --> 04:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
make a repair or make it aware to other
 
04:18:43.269 --> 04:18:43.279 align:start position:0%
you know technicians some dealerships
 
04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
what not but yes these particular tires
 
04:18:48.950 --> 04:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
have been identified as a problem and um
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's actually a a document a
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
published document for these tires where
 
04:18:55.110 --> 04:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
there is a pro-rated replacement
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%

04:19:07.030 --> 04:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:09.030 --> 04:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you mr
 
04:19:10.790 --> 04:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
lynn for taking my question
 
04:19:14.070 --> 04:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
my question is regarding uh recalls
 
04:19:16.469 --> 04:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
and in your experience
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
um especially with new vehicles have you
 
04:19:22.870 --> 04:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
ever as you've done an uh an inspection
 
04:19:25.110 --> 04:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
kind of had to let a
 
04:19:27.189 --> 04:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
person know a customer know like hey you
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
know you need to do this recall it's
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
been out recently we need to do it has
 
04:19:32.469 --> 04:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
that ever happened when you've done
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
these inspections of new vehicles
 
04:19:37.670 --> 04:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
that so anytime a customer schedules an
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
appointment with us and they bring their
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle in
 
04:19:40.080 --> 04:19:41.030 align:start position:0%
vehicle in
um

04:19:41.030 --> 04:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
whether it be the the scheduling team or
 
04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
any of the service advisors we always
 
04:19:47.830 --> 04:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
will check through the vehicle history
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
if there's any open recalls
 
04:19:49.760 --> 04:19:51.269 align:start position:0%
if there's any open recalls
um

04:19:51.269 --> 04:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:53.910 --> 04:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
on any any gm vehicle that we that we
 
04:19:55.510 --> 04:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
get in here um obviously we can't do
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
that with different manufacturers
 
04:19:59.830 --> 04:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
but yes every single vehicle that comes
 
04:20:01.110 --> 04:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
in we check and see if there are any
 
04:20:02.630 --> 04:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
open recalls
 
04:20:02.640 --> 04:20:04.229 align:start position:0%
open recalls
and

04:20:04.229 --> 04:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
we you know make the customer aware of
 
04:20:08.070 --> 04:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
it and if they have time and if we have
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
the parts available
 
04:20:13.750 --> 04:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
we will do it then and there thank you
 
04:20:13.760 --> 04:20:17.670 align:start position:0%
we will do it then and there thank you
welcome

04:20:17.670 --> 04:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:21.590 --> 04:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%

inspector

04:21:44.309 --> 04:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
inspector
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
i oppose the bill for many reasons but i
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
just i want to run down a few we've
 
04:21:50.469 --> 04:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
heard a few things already
 
04:21:50.479 --> 04:21:51.189 align:start position:0%
heard a few things already
but

04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things is
 
04:21:55.110 --> 04:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
right off the bat a vehicle's warranty
 
04:21:57.830 --> 04:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
coverage has no relation to a safety
 
04:21:59.830 --> 04:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
inspection at all that that there's no
 
04:22:03.110 --> 04:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.030 --> 04:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
i don't see the difference between a new
 
04:22:07.510 --> 04:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
or an older vehicle that's driven daily
 
04:22:09.990 --> 04:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh a new vehicle can be driven
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
you know 15 or 20 000 miles an older
 
04:22:14.309 --> 04:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle can be driven the same or vice
 
04:22:15.670 --> 04:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
versa and it really doesn't matter on
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
the age of the vehicle
 
04:22:19.590 --> 04:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
and i know we've reviewed warranty
 
04:22:19.600 --> 04:22:20.710 align:start position:0%
and i know we've reviewed warranty
coverages

04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
coverages
 
04:22:23.590 --> 04:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
um but is it is it the bumper the bumper
 
04:22:25.670 --> 04:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
warranty is it the drivetrain warranty
 
04:22:27.910 --> 04:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
coverage which goes to 100 000 miles in
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
most cases or could even be further
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
it's very there's too many variables so
 
04:22:34.630 --> 04:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's not very clear to me at all
 
04:22:36.389 --> 04:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
um and all the manufacturers have
 
04:22:38.950 --> 04:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
different warranty guidelines so it's uh
 
04:22:41.110 --> 04:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a tough one to
 
04:22:41.120 --> 04:22:41.910 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a tough one to
to

04:22:41.910 --> 04:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:22:44.950 --> 04:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
put a time frame in
 
04:22:47.429 --> 04:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
in addition to that um we obviously we
 
04:22:49.110 --> 04:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
live in a state with extremely difficult
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
road conditions and it's not from a lack
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
of effort from the state or the towns
 
04:22:55.349 --> 04:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's just it's it's challenging seasonal
 
04:22:57.110 --> 04:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
environments that we live in and we see
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
it we we live it we know it
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
um that's just that's that's the
 
04:23:03.110 --> 04:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
environment which we live in
 
04:23:05.429 --> 04:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
i do have a few items that i wanted to
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
mention and they've they've kind of you
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
know dick haran brought some up mr lin
 
04:23:10.870 --> 04:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
brought some up we talked about wiper
 
04:23:13.830 --> 04:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
blades and lamps and tires
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
tires can be you know damaged from a
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
pothole there can be a nail on a tire
 
04:23:20.790 --> 04:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh rendered it unsafe and
 
04:23:22.630 --> 04:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
you'd never know that
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
mr lin talked about brakes rusting if
 
04:23:26.149 --> 04:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
the car sitting
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
and whether the car is new or used i
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
want to reverse to that um
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
the brakes and the tires are going to
 
04:23:33.670 --> 04:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
wear out it doesn't matter what the age
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the vehicle is so
 
04:23:37.750 --> 04:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
04:23:39.510 --> 04:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused that the bill and
 
04:23:41.110 --> 04:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
i and i don't think
 
04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
um you know that that
 
04:23:46.229 --> 04:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
mileage or warranty changes the aspect
 
04:23:47.830 --> 04:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
of safety and what's going to happen to
 
04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
a vehicle so
 
04:23:51.429 --> 04:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
but i that that's my that's my
 
04:23:53.349 --> 04:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
opposition and i would love to answer
 
04:23:55.750 --> 04:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have um you know
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
i again i'm just trying to i'm trying to
 
04:24:00.229 --> 04:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
make sense of the bill um vehicles are
 
04:24:02.469 --> 04:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
on our roads being driven every day and
 
04:24:04.710 --> 04:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh they are wearing out and getting
 
04:24:06.229 --> 04:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
damaged and you know failing in
 
04:24:07.750 --> 04:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
different aspects and that's just part
 
04:24:09.110 --> 04:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
of driving a car
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
so i welcome any questions thank you any
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%

04:25:00.630 --> 04:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists are included in hb 522 and
 
04:25:02.550 --> 04:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
as president of new hampshire motorcycle
 
04:25:03.990 --> 04:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
rights organization
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to hb 522.
 
04:25:09.110 --> 04:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not going to bore you so
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
everybody else has touched on this again
 
04:25:13.110 --> 04:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest things as to why we
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this has to do with tires
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
specifically the back tire of a
 
04:25:17.520 --> 04:25:18.710 align:start position:0%
specifically the back tire of a
motorcycle

04:25:18.710 --> 04:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
motorcycle
 
04:25:18.720 --> 04:25:19.590 align:start position:0%
motorcycle
um

04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:21.269 --> 04:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
they're they're not included in the
 
04:25:22.950 --> 04:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
warranties typically
 
04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
and the rear tire of a motorcycle
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
can wear out for a lot of different
 
04:25:31.110 --> 04:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
reasons um how a rider rides determines
 
04:25:33.910 --> 04:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
a lot about a rear tire on a motorcycle
 
04:25:36.149 --> 04:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
the roadway determines that
 
04:25:38.550 --> 04:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
how much weight a rider carries on their
 
04:25:40.870 --> 04:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
motorcycle so some of the full dressers
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
whether they've got a passenger
 
04:25:45.510 --> 04:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
what they carry whether it be
 
04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
tents and everything else that they
 
04:25:48.070 --> 04:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
carry to go someplace like if they're
 
04:25:49.830 --> 04:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
going out to sturgis
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
how many miles they put on it and i can
 
04:25:54.070 --> 04:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
assure you i put a lot of miles on my
 
04:25:57.189 --> 04:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
motorcycle and had to replace a tire
 
04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh in a year so we feel a rear tire is a
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
safety issue
 
04:26:05.110 --> 04:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
we want to know as a motorcyclist that
 
04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
all the motorcyclists out there are safe
 
04:26:09.110 --> 04:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
we want to know that other vehicles that
 
04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
are on the roadways with us are safe
 
04:26:13.750 --> 04:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we created the task
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
force and the live free ride smart that
 
04:26:17.830 --> 04:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
i showed y'all earlier
 
04:26:20.389 --> 04:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
was we want to educate riders we want to
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
educate the other roadway users we want
 
04:26:26.070 --> 04:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
us to all be proactive in trying to
 
04:26:28.950 --> 04:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
create an environment where we are
 
04:26:31.750 --> 04:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
helping people to not have crashes
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
instead of reacting to them afterwards
 
04:26:34.080 --> 04:26:34.950 align:start position:0%
instead of reacting to them afterwards
so

04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:36.790 --> 04:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
in a short
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
little synopsis
 
04:26:40.630 --> 04:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
we are against
 
04:26:43.750 --> 04:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
um hb 522 because we want to have
 
04:26:45.910 --> 04:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
everybody riding safely
 
04:26:45.920 --> 04:26:46.630 align:start position:0%
everybody riding safely
so

04:26:46.630 --> 04:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
with that i'll take questions if anybody
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
has any questions
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
shane recognizes director belecki new

04:27:19.830 --> 04:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again um mr chairman
 
04:27:21.189 --> 04:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee again for the
 
04:27:23.030 --> 04:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
record my name is elizabeth bialecki
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
director of motor vehicles for the
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
division of motor vehicles i speak today
 
04:27:29.269 --> 04:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill
 
04:27:31.590 --> 04:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
i do strongly believe that the policy
 
04:27:33.750 --> 04:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
that you have set in place really
 
04:27:36.070 --> 04:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
translates on directly translates to the
 
04:27:38.790 --> 04:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
safety of vehicles on the roads in new
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire i have sent you some data that
 
04:27:44.149 --> 04:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
i also pull up on my screen in a second
 
04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll be able to speak to some of
 
04:27:48.229 --> 04:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
the data that really supports that
 
04:27:49.429 --> 04:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to repeat the things
 
04:27:51.189 --> 04:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
that have been said um but i do want to
 
04:27:52.870 --> 04:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
highlight just a couple of things that
 
04:27:55.189 --> 04:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
really are technical issues for me and
 
04:27:57.110 --> 04:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not unsure how we're going to
 
04:27:59.590 --> 04:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
interpret those um so again no
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
definition of a new vehicle
 
04:28:04.469 --> 04:28:04.479 align:start position:0%
um under warranty what type of warranty
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
is it manufacturer's warranty is it an
 
04:28:08.149 --> 04:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
extended warranty is it a
 
04:28:10.229 --> 04:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
bumper-to-bumper warranty
 
04:28:11.510 --> 04:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
there are just different types of
 
04:28:14.550 --> 04:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
warranties and the bill does not define
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
also owned by a natural person not
 
04:28:19.030 --> 04:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
defined what does that mean for
 
04:28:21.110 --> 04:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
businesses there was a great question
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
that was posed as far as how do we
 
04:28:25.510 --> 04:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that we know which vehicles are
 
04:28:27.349 --> 04:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
subject to this exemption and which ones
 
04:28:29.910 --> 04:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
are not i don't know how we can control
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
that so what i could foresee is that we
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
provide the guidance to the dealerships
 
04:28:37.030 --> 04:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
and they determine
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
really whether the vehicle gets a
 
04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
one-year inspection or or a two-year
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
inspection based on the guidance from
 
04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:28:46.630 --> 04:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
so just some technical issues as a
 
04:28:48.389 --> 04:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
result we really were not able to
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
determine the fiscal impact on this
 
04:28:51.670 --> 04:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
because we really don't know the scope
 
04:28:54.070 --> 04:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
of vehicles that this will include
 
04:28:55.349 --> 04:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
i think it also could have some
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
contractual implications
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
as you know we have a contract currently
 
04:29:02.389 --> 04:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
for the inspection program that contract
 
04:29:04.469 --> 04:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
and the price per inspection was based
 
04:29:06.070 --> 04:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
on the number
 
04:29:08.149 --> 04:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
of some assumptions one of them was how
 
04:29:09.990 --> 04:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
many vehicle inspections are performed
 
04:29:12.389 --> 04:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
in the state um i think it would require
 
04:29:13.750 --> 04:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
some legal review but there is a
 
04:29:15.429 --> 04:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
potential that that could change as well
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to bring that to your
 
04:29:17.279 --> 04:29:18.550 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to bring that to your
attention

04:29:18.550 --> 04:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
attention
 
04:29:21.110 --> 04:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
finally i will tell you that i am
 
04:29:22.950 --> 04:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
personally an example of the tire issue
 
04:29:24.790 --> 04:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
so i bought a vehicle almost exactly two
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
years ago and when i inspected it last
 
04:29:30.389 --> 04:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
year in june i was told that i will
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
probably not make it through the winter
 
04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
so in october so i had to buy
 
04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
new tires for a vehicle that had about
 
04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
18 000 miles on it so with that i just
 
04:29:39.040 --> 04:29:39.910 align:start position:0%
18 000 miles on it so with that i just
really

04:29:39.910 --> 04:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:29:42.630 --> 04:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
want to quickly share my screen and you
 
04:29:44.229 --> 04:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
should have this
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
in your mailboxes but i do want to go
 
04:29:49.750 --> 04:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
through this and just highlight some of
 
04:29:52.229 --> 04:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
the safety data that i'm that we have
 
04:29:54.630 --> 04:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
pulled together for you and i think many
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
of you are familiar with this because we
 
04:29:59.349 --> 04:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
typically present this type of data
 
04:30:01.590 --> 04:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
right here about safety inspections but
 
04:30:03.510 --> 04:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
it shows you the top components that
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
typically fail a vehicle for safety
 
04:30:08.550 --> 04:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
reasons so if you look at the most
 
04:30:10.710 --> 04:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
recent year which is year calendar year
 
04:30:14.070 --> 04:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
2020 we had about 1.5
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
million vehicles that were inspected
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
and a little over 200 000 vehicles were
 
04:30:20.950 --> 04:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
identified with safety deficiencies that
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
really caused the failure of inspection
 
04:30:25.269 --> 04:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
so just under 15
 
04:30:26.790 --> 04:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:30:28.870 --> 04:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
new data that i'm really excited to
 
04:30:31.269 --> 04:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
share with you is really on safety
 
04:30:33.110 --> 04:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
recall so i believe representative
 
04:30:35.910 --> 04:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
gorsky had a question on safety recalls
 
04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
and with this new contract a year ago
 
04:30:40.149 --> 04:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
we've implemented a new pro
 
04:30:41.590 --> 04:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
a new contract
 
04:30:44.790 --> 04:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
for safety inspections um in january of
 
04:30:44.800 --> 04:30:46.630 align:start position:0%
for safety inspections um in january of
2020

04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
2020
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
and a new part of that program included
 
04:30:50.790 --> 04:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
safety recall notification so something
 
04:30:52.630 --> 04:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
different that we have not offered in
 
04:30:54.950 --> 04:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
the past and i presented you with some
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
data that again translates directly to
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
the safety on new hampshire roadways
 
04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
so um over the past 12 months at the
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
time of inspection we provided almost
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
200 000 notices to customers that
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
notified them of 272 000
 
04:31:17.110 --> 04:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
safety related recalls that were open
 
04:31:19.990 --> 04:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
recalls on their vehicles
 
04:31:23.590 --> 04:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
of those recalls that we provided 25 of
 
04:31:25.830 --> 04:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
those vehicles that were inspected were
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
model years 2017 and newer
 
04:31:31.990 --> 04:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
almost 50 percent of those with open
 
04:31:32.000 --> 04:31:33.030 align:start position:0%
almost 50 percent of those with open
recalls

04:31:33.030 --> 04:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
recalls
 
04:31:36.790 --> 04:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
were model year 2014 and newer
 
04:31:39.429 --> 04:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
and we gave you a sample of just one
 
04:31:40.870 --> 04:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
inspection month
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
so the vehicles that were inspected
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
during the month of january of 2021
 
04:31:48.070 --> 04:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
with a breakdown by model year
 
04:31:51.590 --> 04:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
and how many of those had open recalls
 
04:31:53.910 --> 04:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
and how many vehicles that involve and
 
04:31:56.469 --> 04:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
that included so for example
 
04:31:59.670 --> 04:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
2020 model year vehicles we had 900
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
vehicles that were identified with an
 
04:32:04.550 --> 04:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
open safety recall
 
04:32:08.149 --> 04:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
and identified 1003 open safety recall
 
04:32:08.159 --> 04:32:09.670 align:start position:0%
and identified 1003 open safety recall
items

04:32:09.670 --> 04:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
items
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
um i could keep going but i will leave
 
04:32:14.070 --> 04:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
it at it leave it at that because i know
 
04:32:15.990 --> 04:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
i signed up for three minutes and i'll
 
04:32:17.590 --> 04:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
make myself available for any questions
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
that you might have thank you
 
04:32:23.830 --> 04:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:32:23.840 --> 04:32:28.309 align:start position:0%
any questions
representative

04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you director
 
04:32:31.990 --> 04:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
um i'll start with the chairman first
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
though because it's a two-part question
 
04:32:37.830 --> 04:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
are we going to hear from the new
 
04:32:39.750 --> 04:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of environmental
 
04:32:44.309 --> 04:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
safety relative to obd issues
 
04:32:45.750 --> 04:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
i don't have them signed up
 
04:32:48.790 --> 04:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative um okay there's a problem
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
i think there's a possibility
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
somebody in the queue is from there but
 
04:32:54.550 --> 04:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
they're not listed
 
04:32:56.710 --> 04:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
and the chance that they may not be
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
director bilecki can you
 
04:32:59.279 --> 04:33:01.990 align:start position:0%
director bilecki can you
um

04:33:01.990 --> 04:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
further elaborate on the implications of
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
this bill relative to new hampshire's
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
compliance with
 
04:33:10.470 --> 04:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
environmental safety issues
 
04:33:14.070 --> 04:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis obd testing
 
04:33:15.029 --> 04:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
representative sykes you always put me
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
on the spot i will speak not as an
 
04:33:21.349 --> 04:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
expert on this topic
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you from my experience
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
and from listening to the department of
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
environmental services that this may in
 
04:33:30.390 --> 04:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
fact have an impact on our ability to
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
comply with epa regulations and again
 
04:33:36.629 --> 04:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
please don't quote me as an expert but i
 
04:33:38.230 --> 04:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
the state does have a plan that they
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
have we have to submit to the epa to
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
ensure that we comply with emission
 
04:33:48.390 --> 04:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
standards and that is based the safety
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
inspection and emissions inspection
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
component is a big part of that plan as
 
04:33:51.920 --> 04:33:52.869 align:start position:0%
component is a big part of that plan as
well

04:33:52.869 --> 04:33:52.879 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:33:55.109 --> 04:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
i think that's about all i can speak to
 
04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
and sound intelligently on that subject
 
04:33:59.189 --> 04:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
and i would again refer you to des for
 
04:34:01.429 --> 04:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
any further questions a follow-up mr
 
04:34:01.439 --> 04:34:03.670 align:start position:0%
any further questions a follow-up mr
chairman

04:34:03.670 --> 04:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:34:06.310 --> 04:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you director um my understanding
 
04:34:08.789 --> 04:34:08.799 align:start position:0%
of the obd program is that that is a
 
04:34:12.150 --> 04:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
required one-year inspection currently
 
04:34:15.029 --> 04:34:15.039 align:start position:0%
and um and that it's
 
04:34:15.039 --> 04:34:17.189 align:start position:0%
and um and that it's
um

04:34:17.189 --> 04:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
this and if i read this bill correctly
 
04:34:21.429 --> 04:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
it does not address that at all so
 
04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
technically if we pass this bill as it's
 
04:34:23.520 --> 04:34:24.629 align:start position:0%
technically if we pass this bill as it's
written

04:34:24.629 --> 04:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:34:26.230 --> 04:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
persons would only have to bring their
 
04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
car in every two years but they still
 
04:34:32.629 --> 04:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:35.189 --> 04:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you potentially
 
04:34:38.230 --> 04:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
either that or um again department of
 
04:34:39.990 --> 04:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
environmental services would have to
 
04:34:42.150 --> 04:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
adjust our state plan to address the
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
fact that we would not be testing as
 
04:34:47.189 --> 04:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
many vehicles on an annual basis as was
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
previously assumed
 
04:34:48.959 --> 04:34:49.830 align:start position:0%
previously assumed
okay

04:34:49.830 --> 04:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:49.840 --> 04:34:50.789 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:52.150 --> 04:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:53.590 --> 04:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman quest
 
04:34:55.990 --> 04:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
finally mr chairman a question for you
 
04:34:59.269 --> 04:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
have the department of environmental
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
services at least present
 
04:35:06.150 --> 04:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh some written testimony after today
 
04:35:07.750 --> 04:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
that would address this issue more
 
04:35:11.590 --> 04:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
succinctly no disrespect to the director
 
04:35:13.349 --> 04:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
none taken
 
04:35:15.510 --> 04:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
well fair enough if they don't end up
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
speaking today i did see another hand
 
04:35:19.750 --> 04:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
we will reach out to them
 
04:35:20.830 --> 04:35:20.840 align:start position:0%

04:35:41.429 --> 04:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
chance for uh scott welsh
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%

good afternoon sir thank you very much
 
04:36:26.789 --> 04:36:26.799 align:start position:0%
for this uh this opportunity
 
04:36:30.310 --> 04:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
um just to follow up a little bit on um
 
04:36:32.629 --> 04:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
director bolecki's comments and uh
 
04:36:35.029 --> 04:36:35.039 align:start position:0%
indirectly to representative sykes
 
04:36:38.230 --> 04:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
question i just wanted to note that um
 
04:36:40.470 --> 04:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 522
 
04:36:43.990 --> 04:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
because it would require a revision
 
04:36:47.109 --> 04:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
to the department of motor vehicles
 
04:36:49.510 --> 04:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
inspection rules it would also require a
 
04:36:51.510 --> 04:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
revision to the um the state
 
04:36:53.109 --> 04:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
implementation plan
 
04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
that we currently have with epa
 
04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
and under that arrangement we would have
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
to wait until epa approves the revisions
 
04:37:03.189 --> 04:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
to the state implementation plan before
 
04:37:05.109 --> 04:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
implementing those changes to the inm
 
04:37:05.119 --> 04:37:07.429 align:start position:0%
implementing those changes to the inm
program

04:37:07.429 --> 04:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:37:09.750 --> 04:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's basically what i
 
04:37:11.590 --> 04:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention and
 
04:37:13.510 --> 04:37:13.520 align:start position:0%

04:37:40.150 --> 04:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:40.160 --> 04:37:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:37:44.150 --> 04:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:46.230 --> 04:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
um anybody that is
 
04:37:48.230 --> 04:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh falling as an attendee if you do wish
 
04:37:49.590 --> 04:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
to speak for this if you could raise
 
04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
again that's my star
 
04:38:03.189 --> 04:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:04.230 --> 04:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought was going to
 
04:38:04.240 --> 04:38:05.990 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought was going to
happen

04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%

04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
answer we're trying to keep as brief as
 
04:38:12.240 --> 04:38:17.670 align:start position:0%
answer we're trying to keep as brief as
possible

04:38:17.670 --> 04:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman can you hear me
 
04:38:22.310 --> 04:38:22.320 align:start position:0%

04:38:23.910 --> 04:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh and also with the committee thank you
 
04:38:26.070 --> 04:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
for for listening to me uh my name is
 
04:38:28.070 --> 04:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
jason mccrory general manager at auto
 
04:38:31.349 --> 04:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
fair honda i've been here for 26 years
 
04:38:33.269 --> 04:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
and a big part of my job is to make sure
 
04:38:35.910 --> 04:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
that the cars on the road are safe
 
04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
my son was just in a car accident in 93
 
04:38:39.189 --> 04:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
when the car in front of him lost
 
04:38:39.199 --> 04:38:40.390 align:start position:0%
when the car in front of him lost
control

04:38:40.390 --> 04:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
and you know the items that we are
 
04:38:44.070 --> 04:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
inspecting at the annual safety
 
04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
inspection they're not warranty items
 
04:38:48.230 --> 04:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
they're safety items they're wear items
 
04:38:49.990 --> 04:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard from a number of people
 
04:38:51.830 --> 04:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
from the car dealerships
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
tires in particular brakes lights these
 
04:38:57.029 --> 04:38:57.039 align:start position:0%
are really really important safety items
 
04:38:58.789 --> 04:38:58.799 align:start position:0%
uh in the back of my building are the
 
04:39:01.109 --> 04:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
tires that we're taking off cars and
 
04:39:03.429 --> 04:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
many of them are just they're just bald
 
04:39:06.551 --> 04:39:06.561 align:start position:0%
they don't belong on our roads um the
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
other thing that i find very confusing
 
04:39:08.000 --> 04:39:08.709 align:start position:0%
other thing that i find very confusing
is

04:39:08.709 --> 04:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
the warranty
 
04:39:12.789 --> 04:39:12.799 align:start position:0%
warranty is time
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
or miles uh not timing and miles so time
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
is consistent so you have a three-year
 
04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
warranty or four-year warranty or a
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
five-year warranty in some cases you
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
have up to a 10-year warranty
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
but it's also limited by mileage which
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
is which makes it really confusing
 
04:39:30.150 --> 04:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
um if you have a 20 if you drive 20 000
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
miles a year and you have a three-year
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
warranty then you actually have less
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
than a two year warranty so that would
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
definitely cause a lot of confusion
 
04:39:39.830 --> 04:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
so there are at least five different
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
warranties um
 
04:39:41.760 --> 04:39:43.030 align:start position:0%
warranties um
franchise

04:39:43.030 --> 04:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
franchise
 
04:39:44.788 --> 04:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
warranties and
 
04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know volkswagen for example we have
 
04:39:48.788 --> 04:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
a volkswagen franchise they've actually
 
04:39:50.550 --> 04:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
changed their warranty three times in
 
04:39:52.070 --> 04:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
the last five years
 
04:39:54.470 --> 04:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
so um that certainly could cause some
 
04:39:54.480 --> 04:39:55.750 align:start position:0%
so um that certainly could cause some
confusion

04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
i certainly can appreciate wanting to
 
04:39:59.350 --> 04:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
save people money i like to save money
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:40:03.270 --> 04:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
but if you save 45
 
04:40:06.628 --> 04:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
um on a safety inspection uh really once
 
04:40:09.590 --> 04:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
over over a five-year period um you're
 
04:40:11.190 --> 04:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
saving nine dollars over a five year
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
period and you know that that 45 is just
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
not worth
 
04:40:16.948 --> 04:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
us you know getting our professional
 
04:40:19.350 --> 04:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
technicians to get eyeballs on the
 
04:40:20.868 --> 04:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
brakes the tires and the other items
 
04:40:22.150 --> 04:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
that are really important to keep our
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
roads safe
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we do do in many
 
04:40:29.110 --> 04:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
many cases is prepare customers for
 
04:40:31.590 --> 04:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
future things so it may pass inspection
 
04:40:33.910 --> 04:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
today but you might need to save some
 
04:40:35.910 --> 04:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
money for you know three four five six
 
04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
months down the road and i think that's
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
a great service for people
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you for your time and i am
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
open for any questions
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:50.400 --> 04:40:51.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:55.350 --> 04:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:57.670 --> 04:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
the telephone number last three numbers
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
seven nine five i certainly don't want
 
04:41:05.670 --> 04:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:07.270 --> 04:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
you guys see it pulled up if you can
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman and committee

members my name is ronald pourier i'm
 
04:41:30.628 --> 04:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
the president owner of bob and sons
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%

04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
on kelly street on manchester's west
 
04:41:37.110 --> 04:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
side and i'm also a member of the
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
talking cars with dick and ron we do a
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
one day thursday morning radio show uh
 
04:41:44.150 --> 04:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
in manchester as well we've been doing
 
04:41:46.230 --> 04:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
that for eight years and i'd like to
 
04:41:50.550 --> 04:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to house bill 522
 
04:41:52.230 --> 04:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
there have been a lot of reasons that
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
have been mentioned that are very very
 
04:41:54.000 --> 04:41:55.110 align:start position:0%
have been mentioned that are very very
good

04:41:55.110 --> 04:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:41:56.470 --> 04:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
i think that one of the things that we
 
04:41:58.628 --> 04:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
need to be aware of is that
 
04:42:00.708 --> 04:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any manufacturer's
 
04:42:03.750 --> 04:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
warranty that covers any wear items such
 
04:42:06.310 --> 04:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
as tires brakes wipers
 
04:42:09.030 --> 04:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
any accidental damage that
 
04:42:11.350 --> 04:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
happens is never covered by the by the
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
warranty as well uh there obviously is a
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion about which warranty
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
and whose warranty and what year did
 
04:42:20.550 --> 04:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
they give you that warranty so there's
 
04:42:22.628 --> 04:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of changes a lot of issues
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
there the other thing that i think is
 
04:42:27.110 --> 04:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
very important to remember is not only
 
04:42:27.120 --> 04:42:27.910 align:start position:0%
very important to remember is not only
uh

04:42:27.910 --> 04:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:30.070 --> 04:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of has been mentioned about road
 
04:42:31.830 --> 04:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
conditions and the environment that we
 
04:42:34.708 --> 04:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
live in but also driver habits the type
 
04:42:37.590 --> 04:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
of operation is this person an uber
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
driver are they in the city all day long
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
are they putting on lots of city miles
 
04:42:43.830 --> 04:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
which tend to wear out brakes and things
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
like that so
 
04:42:47.510 --> 04:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh because of that i think it has a lot
 
04:42:49.110 --> 04:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
of times it has less to do with the
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
actual car and more to do with driver
 
04:42:54.550 --> 04:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
habits accidents the conditions the type
 
04:42:56.948 --> 04:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
of roads that the person is driving on
 
04:42:59.830 --> 04:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
the winterization treatment that we use
 
04:42:59.840 --> 04:43:00.788 align:start position:0%
the winterization treatment that we use
to

04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:43:03.190 --> 04:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
eliminate salt and flush and ice i mean
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
those things raise havoc with corrosion
 
04:43:07.590 --> 04:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
on many vehicles so
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
we've i've been in this business for
 
04:43:11.190 --> 04:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
over 40 years been inspecting cars since
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
i was a young guy and we i've seen it
 
04:43:17.350 --> 04:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
all but i'm never amazed by some car
 
04:43:19.030 --> 04:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
every month that comes in and we're just
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
amazed that it was even driving when it
 
04:43:21.830 --> 04:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
came in
 
04:43:26.390 --> 04:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh i'd be happy to uh take any questions
 
04:43:31.510 --> 04:43:31.520 align:start position:0%

04:44:03.750 --> 04:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman and member of the
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
committee uh thank you i'm in opposition
 
04:44:08.230 --> 04:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:44:10.948 --> 04:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
for all the reasons that are stated um
 
04:44:12.788 --> 04:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
two points i'd like to make quickly if i
 
04:44:12.798 --> 04:44:14.708 align:start position:0%
two points i'd like to make quickly if i
may

04:44:14.708 --> 04:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:44:16.470 --> 04:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
if you would
 
04:44:18.550 --> 04:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
just consider whether this bill would
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
make the
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
roads in new hampshire
 
04:44:25.510 --> 04:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
more safe or less safe
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
and contemplate that
 
04:44:29.830 --> 04:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh i have seen like these other
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
gentlemen many things that come in with
 
04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
cars well under
 
04:44:36.310 --> 04:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
15 20 000 miles that have issues but you
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
know will we be
 
04:44:40.470 --> 04:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
more safe or less safe
 
04:44:41.590 --> 04:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:44:44.310 --> 04:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh with common sense i say
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
for me less less less safe
 
04:44:47.040 --> 04:44:47.830 align:start position:0%
for me less less less safe
um

04:44:47.830 --> 04:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:49.110 --> 04:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
second of all
 
04:44:51.750 --> 04:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
um it's the best deal on main street
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
for 40 45 whatever it is for inspection
 
04:44:57.910 --> 04:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
you're getting a professional
 
04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
they'll go over a car
 
04:45:00.320 --> 04:45:01.030 align:start position:0%
they'll go over a car
that

04:45:01.030 --> 04:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
carries your family
 
04:45:06.390 --> 04:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
and that you want to keep safe
 
04:45:08.830 --> 04:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
and get some semblance of what's going
 
04:45:10.868 --> 04:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
on it's
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
seriously a really good
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
thing for the for the public and for us
 
04:45:19.990 --> 04:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
everybody that's on the road so i leave
 
04:45:22.150 --> 04:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
it with that um
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
that it's just safety is the number one
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
concern for us
 
04:45:29.190 --> 04:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the ability to speak
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much
 
04:45:32.550 --> 04:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
sir would you take any questions if
 
04:45:34.390 --> 04:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
there are any i would certainly take
 
04:45:34.400 --> 04:45:35.590 align:start position:0%
there are any i would certainly take
questions

04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:45:39.430 --> 04:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much have a
 
04:45:42.390 --> 04:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon

yep
 
04:45:47.750 --> 04:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh i noticed that um
 
04:45:50.550 --> 04:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative ankerberg was an attendee
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
you can still watch what's going on if
 
04:46:04.628 --> 04:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:06.788 --> 04:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm sorry
 
04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:13.910 --> 04:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
this chair recognizes dan bennett he's
 
04:46:15.990 --> 04:46:16.000 align:start position:0%

good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
the committee can you hear me okay
 
04:46:43.270 --> 04:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
04:46:45.590 --> 04:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much um my name is
 
04:46:46.868 --> 04:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
dan bennett from the new hampshire auto
 
04:46:48.628 --> 04:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
dealers association as you know we're a
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
trade association for the motor vehicle
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
industry um i will be brief i will do my
 
04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
best not to repeat um and and thank you
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
for the uh the opportunity um
 
04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to hb hb522 just as
 
04:47:04.310 --> 04:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
you've heard from all the the speakers
 
04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
prior uh the experts uh the folks who
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
live and breathe this and see it every
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
single day so similar legislation to
 
04:47:13.750 --> 04:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
this bill or different iterations have
 
04:47:16.708 --> 04:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
been offered over the past um and they
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
have always failed uh they've always
 
04:47:20.628 --> 04:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
failed for the right reason that reason
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
being roadway safety there's also been
 
04:47:25.430 --> 04:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
analysis of the data and the data proves
 
04:47:27.510 --> 04:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
that this is a a
 
04:47:29.430 --> 04:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
a bad idea
 
04:47:31.030 --> 04:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
director b leckie mentioned the failure
 
04:47:33.030 --> 04:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
rate of 15 percent for vehicles and i
 
04:47:34.390 --> 04:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
would offer this
 
04:47:39.270 --> 04:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
that 15 failure rate is in at least 15
 
04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
because when my vehicle comes in my
 
04:47:43.990 --> 04:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
mechanic calls me and says mr bennett
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
you need new tires and i say go ahead
 
04:47:49.510 --> 04:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to put on i want a safe vehicle
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
he doesn't record my car as a failure he
 
04:47:53.590 --> 04:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
puts the safe tires on it gives me a
 
04:47:56.550 --> 04:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
pass so that 15 number
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's the bare minimum
 
04:48:00.550 --> 04:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
okay so the number i would actually say
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
um realistically is probably a little
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
bit higher so um
 
04:48:07.190 --> 04:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen other models where
 
04:48:08.788 --> 04:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
they've moved to model year exemptions
 
04:48:11.350 --> 04:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
great britain again to data great
 
04:48:14.070 --> 04:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
britain has a three model year exemption
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
when finally tested those vehicles have
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
a 40 percent failure rate that's
 
04:48:19.910 --> 04:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly high number of vehicles that
 
04:48:21.670 --> 04:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
are on the road
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
the institute for public safety uh did a
 
04:48:27.830 --> 04:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
study a couple years back they said 12
 
04:48:31.030 --> 04:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
12 and a half percent of crashes were
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
mechanical item related um and uh over
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
850 000 accidents could have been
 
04:48:39.510 --> 04:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
avoided uh as a result
 
04:48:39.520 --> 04:48:40.390 align:start position:0%
avoided uh as a result
another

04:48:40.390 --> 04:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:48:42.390 --> 04:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
data point i'll bring up pennsylvania in
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
2009 analyzed their annual safety
 
04:48:46.070 --> 04:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
inspection program
 
04:48:46.080 --> 04:48:46.948 align:start position:0%
inspection program
um

04:48:46.948 --> 04:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:49.510 --> 04:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
and said because of the program it saved
 
04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
over 127 to 187 lives just do the annual
 
04:48:53.280 --> 04:48:55.350 align:start position:0%
over 127 to 187 lives just do the annual
inspection

04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
if it saves but one life i think the
 
04:48:59.110 --> 04:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
programs of value
 
04:49:00.628 --> 04:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
you've heard from other folks about
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
value best deal on main street stuff
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
like that i would say we do the same
 
04:49:06.628 --> 04:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
with our with our bodies as we do our
 
04:49:08.948 --> 04:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
vehicles we do an annual physical right
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh getting on a statin once a year is a
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
heck of a lot cheaper than triple bypass
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
surgery so preventative maintenance
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
saves money just like the recall issue
 
04:49:20.310 --> 04:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
catches recalls
 
04:49:22.788 --> 04:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
covered under warranty helps make a
 
04:49:25.670 --> 04:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
safer vehicle saves consumers from money
 
04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
some money there um
 
04:49:29.830 --> 04:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
to uh one thing i did want to mention i
 
04:49:31.910 --> 04:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
sent you all a fact sheet yesterday it
 
04:49:34.948 --> 04:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
includes a winter severity map okay and
 
04:49:36.788 --> 04:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
we discussed i heard you know new
 
04:49:38.948 --> 04:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire is not iowa uh new hampshire
 
04:49:40.230 --> 04:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
is not or
 
04:49:42.708 --> 04:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
other snowier states um you know we
 
04:49:44.070 --> 04:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
can't compare new hampshire to florida
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's apples to oranges however if you
 
04:49:48.150 --> 04:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
look at the winter severity map that i
 
04:49:50.708 --> 04:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
showed you snowier doesn't necessarily
 
04:49:52.230 --> 04:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
mean more
 
04:49:54.550 --> 04:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
severe roads winter severity is a number
 
04:49:55.910 --> 04:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
of factors
 
04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire you know up in the
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
corner is actually incredibly low down
 
04:50:03.910 --> 04:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
on the scale and it's not the same as
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
even some of those midwestern states
 
04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
that were referred to um
 
04:50:10.550 --> 04:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know they don't um they don't have
 
04:50:13.030 --> 04:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
frost heaves they don't have 52 degrees
 
04:50:16.070 --> 04:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
at christmas and then uh 20 a week and a
 
04:50:18.070 --> 04:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
half later they don't have frost tubes
 
04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
and they certainly don't spray liquid
 
04:50:22.708 --> 04:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
salt water brine on their roads to get
 
04:50:23.910 --> 04:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of our cars and
 
04:50:25.830 --> 04:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
deteriorate them so our severe
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
conditions uh create a very different
 
04:50:29.750 --> 04:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
microclimate and it's the reason that
 
04:50:31.110 --> 04:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
all of our new england neighbors
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
maintain an annual inspection is because
 
04:50:37.270 --> 04:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
of those those severe weather conditions
 
04:50:38.708 --> 04:50:38.718 align:start position:0%
a couple of the other things because i
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
know my time is limited
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
that i will mention is i did hear about
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
a new jersey program
 
04:50:47.670 --> 04:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
new jersey's inspection program back in
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
2010 uh coming on the heels of a tough
 
04:50:53.110 --> 04:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
economic time was a state-run and
 
04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
administered program the state stations
 
04:50:55.840 --> 04:50:56.708 align:start position:0%
administered program the state stations
were

04:50:56.708 --> 04:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:50:58.868 --> 04:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
staffed by union employees and that
 
04:51:00.628 --> 04:51:00.638 align:start position:0%
program was dropped not for safety
 
04:51:03.750 --> 04:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
reasons it was dropped because no an 11
 
04:51:05.590 --> 04:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
uh annual cost to the state so our
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
program which is independent business
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
folks free market market rate sets the
 
04:51:15.830 --> 04:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
price is a very very different program
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
than what um
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
is in place um in
 
04:51:22.230 --> 04:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
in that particular example um
 
04:51:23.590 --> 04:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
the last two things that i'll mention
 
04:51:25.830 --> 04:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
real quick we do concur with director b
 
04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
leckie um and tim white from the
 
04:51:30.550 --> 04:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
this will put us uh at odds with our
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
state implementation plan of our clean
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
air act
 
04:51:37.990 --> 04:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
potential as we've heard in the past
 
04:51:39.750 --> 04:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
years when this has been proposed it
 
04:51:41.430 --> 04:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
potentially puts us at risk for
 
04:51:43.910 --> 04:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
sanctions on our highway funds money our
 
04:51:45.910 --> 04:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
agreement is that we will annually test
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
vehicles 20 years older or newer
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
this program change or this proposal
 
04:51:53.590 --> 04:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
changes that cycle
 
04:51:56.230 --> 04:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
and the epa has not in fact approved
 
04:51:58.470 --> 04:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
that so the last thing that i'll mention
 
04:52:01.110 --> 04:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
too is based on this proposal there is
 
04:52:03.510 --> 04:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
revenue loss it's indeterminal by the
 
04:52:03.520 --> 04:52:04.390 align:start position:0%
revenue loss it's indeterminal by the
state

04:52:04.390 --> 04:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:52:07.590 --> 04:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
but in this in this budget uh you know
 
04:52:10.390 --> 04:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
scenario or budget cycle that we're in
 
04:52:13.270 --> 04:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
we should be attentive to revenue loss
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
but the general fund will take a hit as
 
04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
will the air pollution abatement fund
 
04:52:20.310 --> 04:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
which receives a portion of inspection
 
04:52:23.110 --> 04:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
sticker sales uh into that fund as well
 
04:52:25.990 --> 04:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
so stu two state funds that uh will
 
04:52:28.550 --> 04:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
suffer some type of revenue loss so um
 
04:52:30.708 --> 04:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time i'm sorry for
 
04:52:35.590 --> 04:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
how quickly i spoke um but if there are
 
04:52:37.830 --> 04:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
any questions uh i would welcome the
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities to see if i can assist or
 
04:52:43.350 --> 04:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:49.350 --> 04:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:55.990 --> 04:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay i still see quite a few names up on
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
the list uh last call for everybody to
 
04:52:58.958 --> 04:52:59.990 align:start position:0%
the list uh last call for everybody to
speak

04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
speak
 
04:53:01.510 --> 04:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
to this
 
04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
in your
 
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:27.750 --> 04:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair however i was just
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
waiting for the executive session
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:35.830 --> 04:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
well seeing no other speakers then
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
uh i'm gonna close the public hearing
 
04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:43.600 --> 04:53:45.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:53:45.190 --> 04:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
well i schedule an executive session for
 
04:53:48.000 --> 04:53:48.948 align:start position:0%
well i schedule an executive session for
two

04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
i think it did pretty well it's 159
 
04:53:53.590 --> 04:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
however that doesn't afford
 
04:53:56.310 --> 04:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
myself for the clerk to reset
 
04:53:59.270 --> 04:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
so uh if you don't mind we're gonna do
 
04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
it just a ten minute recess and then
 
04:54:08.230 --> 04:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:09.910 --> 04:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
a little record but i didn't mention i
 
04:54:11.750 --> 04:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
did speak to tim white several times and
 
04:54:13.110 --> 04:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
he said they were taking
 
04:54:15.430 --> 04:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
no position
 
04:54:17.990 --> 04:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
and i should verify that you get new
 
04:54:18.000 --> 04:54:42.550 align:start position:0%
and i should verify that you get new
jerseys

04:54:42.550 --> 04:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:42.560 --> 04:54:56.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:54:56.550 --> 04:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:56.560 --> 04:55:10.628 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:10.638 --> 04:55:24.628 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:55:24.628 --> 04:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:24.638 --> 04:56:06.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:56:06.560 --> 04:56:34.628 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:56:34.628 --> 04:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:34.638 --> 04:57:02.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:57:02.550 --> 04:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:02.560 --> 04:57:30.550 align:start position:0%

this
 
05:20:01.990 --> 05:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
amendment um simply puts us into the
 
05:20:05.350 --> 05:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
same position that this committee was in
 
05:20:07.910 --> 05:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
um i guess it's pretty close to 12
 
05:20:09.830 --> 05:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
months ago
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
when the bill passed in this committee
 
05:20:12.240 --> 05:20:14.310 align:start position:0%
when the bill passed in this committee
14-3

05:20:14.310 --> 05:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
14-3
 
05:20:15.990 --> 05:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
it simply
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
puts us in line with national standards
 
05:20:24.070 --> 05:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.070 --> 05:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'll add too um i looked at the bill
 
05:20:28.948 --> 05:20:28.958 align:start position:0%
several times original bill underlying
 
05:20:30.868 --> 05:20:30.878 align:start position:0%
i didn't see any any changes to it
 
05:20:33.750 --> 05:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
looked almost identical to me um this is
 
05:20:35.590 --> 05:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
the exact amendment we had from last
 
05:20:37.510 --> 05:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
year's as well
 
05:20:39.190 --> 05:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
and again all it does
 
05:20:41.110 --> 05:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
i know we've had the conversation of the
 
05:20:43.670 --> 05:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
certain ways things are measured this
 
05:20:45.670 --> 05:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
does follow and allow
 
05:20:45.680 --> 05:20:46.708 align:start position:0%
does follow and allow
the

05:20:46.708 --> 05:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:20:48.868 --> 05:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
nitsa's the national recommendation and
 
05:20:50.868 --> 05:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
allowance for 70
 
05:20:53.510 --> 05:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
like transmittance
 
05:20:56.390 --> 05:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh on the side windows left and right
 
05:20:56.400 --> 05:20:57.350 align:start position:0%
uh on the side windows left and right
so

05:20:57.350 --> 05:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
in essence it's the identical build that
 
05:21:01.270 --> 05:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
we had last year this is the identity
 
05:21:01.280 --> 05:21:03.430 align:start position:0%
we had last year this is the identity
member

05:21:03.430 --> 05:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
member
 
05:21:06.788 --> 05:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:09.910 --> 05:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
so i was one of the three
 
05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
last year who voted against this bill
 
05:21:16.390 --> 05:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
even as it is amended i appreciate the
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
amendment it does improve the bill over
 
05:21:21.510 --> 05:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
the original version submitted to us
 
05:21:25.030 --> 05:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
however i i cannot support the bill as
 
05:21:28.390 --> 05:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
ought to pass even as amended because
 
05:21:31.590 --> 05:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
of my concern that the
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
nearly unanimous opposition to it on the
 
05:21:35.830 --> 05:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
side of public safety
 
05:21:37.830 --> 05:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:21:39.590 --> 05:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
sergeant christopher kelby from the
 
05:21:42.628 --> 05:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
department of safety was opposed
 
05:21:44.310 --> 05:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
captain william haynes from the office
 
05:21:45.830 --> 05:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
of highway safety and also the
 
05:21:47.590 --> 05:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
department of safety was
 
05:21:47.600 --> 05:21:48.708 align:start position:0%
department of safety was
also

05:21:48.708 --> 05:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:21:51.590 --> 05:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
opposed and my own life's experience
 
05:21:53.350 --> 05:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
speaks to the
 
05:21:53.360 --> 05:21:54.788 align:start position:0%
speaks to the
the

05:21:54.788 --> 05:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:21:56.550 --> 05:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
importance of being able to make eye
 
05:21:58.948 --> 05:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
contact with drivers at
 
05:22:01.190 --> 05:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
um intersections
 
05:22:02.868 --> 05:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
05:22:04.628 --> 05:22:04.638 align:start position:0%
sergeant kelby did not disagree with
 
05:22:06.788 --> 05:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
that statement so for the for the reason
 
05:22:09.270 --> 05:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
of supporting public safety and my my
 
05:22:10.868 --> 05:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
feeling that this is
 
05:22:10.878 --> 05:22:13.510 align:start position:0%
feeling that this is
um

05:22:13.510 --> 05:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:15.030 --> 05:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
not in the best interest of the
 
05:22:17.910 --> 05:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of the motoring
 
05:22:20.310 --> 05:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
public in the state i will be opposed to
 
05:22:20.320 --> 05:22:21.110 align:start position:0%
public in the state i will be opposed to
this

05:22:21.110 --> 05:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:22:21.120 --> 05:22:22.070 align:start position:0%
this
motion

05:22:22.070 --> 05:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:22:23.430 --> 05:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:22:25.510 --> 05:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
speaking to the amendment
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative smith thank you mr
 
05:22:27.440 --> 05:22:28.390 align:start position:0%
representative smith thank you mr
chairman

05:22:28.390 --> 05:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
those concerns may have been valid on
 
05:22:32.868 --> 05:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill but with the
 
05:22:32.878 --> 05:22:34.230 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill but with the
amendment

05:22:34.230 --> 05:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
our standards will now match national
 
05:22:38.470 --> 05:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
highway traffic safety administration
 
05:22:40.868 --> 05:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
standards and will literally not make
 
05:22:42.550 --> 05:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
one more car window in new hampshire
 
05:22:44.628 --> 05:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
darker than what is currently allowed
 
05:22:46.150 --> 05:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
it will just mean that if you have an
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
older cheaper car that didn't get the
 
05:22:50.550 --> 05:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
tent from the factory that is currently
 
05:22:52.470 --> 05:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
legal in the state of new hampshire you
 
05:22:54.948 --> 05:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
can upgrade and that's all this means so
 
05:22:57.110 --> 05:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
i don't see why we should penalize one

portion of the population because they
 
05:23:01.190 --> 05:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't buy a brand new car from having
 
05:23:02.948 --> 05:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
what's currently considered safe and
 
05:23:05.430 --> 05:23:05.440 align:start position:0%

05:23:14.480 --> 05:23:16.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i just wanted

05:23:16.390 --> 05:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
as i'm reading the amendment
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
point out a concern that came up about
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
the wording on the the
 
05:23:26.788 --> 05:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
net light transmittance if there's
 
05:23:26.798 --> 05:23:27.910 align:start position:0%
net light transmittance if there's
already

05:23:27.910 --> 05:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:23:29.270 --> 05:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
an existing
 
05:23:29.280 --> 05:23:30.948 align:start position:0%
an existing
um

05:23:30.948 --> 05:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:33.270 --> 05:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
tint on a on a window as manufactured
 
05:23:35.430 --> 05:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
and then an additional tint is put on
 
05:23:38.868 --> 05:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
aftermarket um that would then
 
05:23:41.510 --> 05:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
be harder to clarify what the total
 
05:23:44.230 --> 05:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
amount is and there was discussion about
 
05:23:44.240 --> 05:23:45.510 align:start position:0%
amount is and there was discussion about
the

05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:23:46.868 --> 05:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
the net
 
05:23:46.878 --> 05:23:48.708 align:start position:0%
the net
number

05:23:48.708 --> 05:23:48.718 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:23:50.310 --> 05:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
to take into account both issues so i'm
 
05:23:52.070 --> 05:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
trouble with this amendment because it
 
05:23:55.990 --> 05:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't i don't feel it's clear in that
 
05:23:56.000 --> 05:23:57.830 align:start position:0%
doesn't i don't feel it's clear in that
regard

05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
regard
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
but thank you
 
05:24:02.070 --> 05:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
from what i understand representative
 
05:24:03.670 --> 05:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
the inspection stations do currently
 
05:24:05.430 --> 05:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
have to check and
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
it measures if it measures 70 or less
 
05:24:11.990 --> 05:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're good if somebody doubles up it
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
puts a different
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
intent on top of another tip and it
 
05:24:16.080 --> 05:24:17.030 align:start position:0%
intent on top of another tip and it
fails

05:24:17.030 --> 05:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
fails
 
05:24:23.190 --> 05:24:23.200 align:start position:0%

05:24:34.230 --> 05:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
05:24:36.628 --> 05:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
being able to see through this glass for
 
05:24:39.590 --> 05:24:39.600 align:start position:0%

05:24:47.190 --> 05:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's not like limousine tent where it's
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
a dark
 
05:24:51.430 --> 05:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
pretending that you can't see through so
 
05:24:53.270 --> 05:24:53.280 align:start position:0%

05:27:25.430 --> 05:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
at all
 
05:27:28.390 --> 05:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
05:27:31.030 --> 05:27:31.040 align:start position:0%

05:27:39.190 --> 05:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative true's comment
 
05:27:43.350 --> 05:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
if uh if someone purchases a new car
 
05:27:43.360 --> 05:27:44.548 align:start position:0%
if uh if someone purchases a new car
in

05:27:44.548 --> 05:27:44.558 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:27:46.548 --> 05:27:46.558 align:start position:0%
um actually if someone purchases an
 
05:27:49.430 --> 05:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
older car in massachusetts and puts
 
05:27:51.270 --> 05:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
that window tint on
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
versus someone over the border in salem
 
05:27:56.868 --> 05:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't put that tind on
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
the car that's driven from massachusetts
 
05:28:03.750 --> 05:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
in on new hampshire roads would be legal
 
05:28:06.708 --> 05:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
the car that's purchased in salem
 
05:28:09.510 --> 05:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh would not be legal if those
 
05:28:11.830 --> 05:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
if that had window 10 put on it is that
 
05:28:11.840 --> 05:28:14.868 align:start position:0%
if that had window 10 put on it is that
correct

05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:16.390 --> 05:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
again please i didn't know your ass
 
05:28:17.750 --> 05:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
could be equipped
 
05:28:17.760 --> 05:28:18.948 align:start position:0%
could be equipped
ah

05:28:18.948 --> 05:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
ah
 
05:28:18.958 --> 05:28:20.390 align:start position:0%
ah
um

05:28:20.390 --> 05:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:23.670 --> 05:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is if a car
 
05:28:25.830 --> 05:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts an older car puts
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:31.350 --> 05:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
and drives on new hampshire roads that
 
05:28:33.750 --> 05:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
would be legal correct
 
05:28:34.708 --> 05:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
if a
 
05:28:37.910 --> 05:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
car in salem new hampshire
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
same year same everything
 
05:28:43.590 --> 05:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
put window tint on
 
05:28:45.270 --> 05:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
of the same type
 
05:28:47.190 --> 05:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
and drove on new hampshire roads that
 
05:28:48.628 --> 05:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
would be illegal
 
05:28:51.750 --> 05:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:53.750 --> 05:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like a safety issue to me
 
05:28:53.760 --> 05:28:55.750 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like a safety issue to me
either

05:28:55.750 --> 05:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
either
 
05:29:00.548 --> 05:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:01.750 --> 05:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
all the world when she's ready the

05:44:40.548 --> 05:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
three one nine h
 
05:44:43.590 --> 05:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
and as amended this amendment for this
 
05:44:46.470 --> 05:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
bill increases the maximum gross weight

loaded on the log landings
 
05:44:58.390 --> 05:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is a big benefit to the forest
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
product industry because the
 
05:45:03.110 --> 05:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
drive axle weight limit being requested
 
05:45:04.230 --> 05:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
05:45:05.990 --> 05:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
is consistent with our neighboring
 
05:45:08.310 --> 05:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
states and other truck configuration tax
 
05:45:08.320 --> 05:45:09.350 align:start position:0%
states and other truck configuration tax
limits

05:45:09.350 --> 05:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
limits
 
05:45:11.270 --> 05:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is supported by the department

05:45:21.350 --> 05:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
the forest harvesting industry has spent
 
05:45:22.948 --> 05:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of time and
 
05:45:22.958 --> 05:45:24.230 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of time and
resources

05:45:24.230 --> 05:45:24.240 align:start position:0%

trying to comply with the current
 
05:45:27.670 --> 05:45:27.680 align:start position:0%

okay

05:45:43.110 --> 05:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:45:45.510 --> 05:45:45.520 align:start position:0%

okay the amendment is adopted
 
05:47:07.990 --> 05:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
the motion now is out to pass as amended
 
05:47:09.510 --> 05:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
in the discussion
 
05:47:23.510 --> 05:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
05:47:26.788 --> 05:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
um i voted reluctantly for the amendment
 
05:47:28.628 --> 05:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
because it is a slight improvement over
 
05:47:31.910 --> 05:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
the original bill that was submitted
 
05:47:34.230 --> 05:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
and while i recognize that this
 
05:47:34.240 --> 05:47:35.750 align:start position:0%
and while i recognize that this
there's

05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
some very good reasons for passing this
 
05:47:39.190 --> 05:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
i am
 
05:47:42.390 --> 05:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
equally concerned that
 
05:47:45.990 --> 05:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
as new hampshire's dot's funding
 
05:47:49.030 --> 05:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
situation gets worse and worse and worse
 
05:47:49.040 --> 05:47:49.990 align:start position:0%
situation gets worse and worse and worse
and

05:47:49.990 --> 05:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:47:51.750 --> 05:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
where we find less and less money
 
05:47:54.708 --> 05:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
available to maintain our roads
 
05:47:57.590 --> 05:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that the time frame between
 
05:48:00.470 --> 05:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
repairs for roads is lengthening out and
 
05:48:02.070 --> 05:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
lengthening out
 
05:48:05.030 --> 05:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
um that's a big concern for me on top of
 
05:48:05.040 --> 05:48:05.910 align:start position:0%
um that's a big concern for me on top of
that

05:48:05.910 --> 05:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
when the roads start to degrade
 
05:48:08.080 --> 05:48:09.350 align:start position:0%
when the roads start to degrade
um

05:48:09.350 --> 05:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:11.750 --> 05:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
that has an impact on people's personal
 
05:48:13.830 --> 05:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
automobiles because if the road is bad
 
05:48:15.190 --> 05:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
then it takes
 
05:48:17.430 --> 05:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
adds additional wear and tear to your
 
05:48:19.030 --> 05:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
shocks uh
 
05:48:20.788 --> 05:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
not that i'm a mechanic mind you
 
05:48:22.948 --> 05:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
whenever i do tool stuff blood results
 
05:48:25.270 --> 05:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
usually mine
 
05:48:25.280 --> 05:48:26.150 align:start position:0%
usually mine
but

05:48:26.150 --> 05:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:48:28.708 --> 05:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
nevertheless i know that bad roads can
 
05:48:30.708 --> 05:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
lead to further deterioration of your
 
05:48:30.718 --> 05:48:31.750 align:start position:0%
lead to further deterioration of your
vehicle

05:48:31.750 --> 05:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
05:48:31.760 --> 05:48:32.868 align:start position:0%
vehicle
um

05:48:32.868 --> 05:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:32.878 --> 05:48:33.750 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:48:33.750 --> 05:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:48:33.760 --> 05:48:34.788 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:48:34.788 --> 05:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:36.070 --> 05:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
let's see there was one other point i
 
05:48:37.350 --> 05:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to make
 
05:48:37.360 --> 05:48:39.510 align:start position:0%
wanted to make
um

05:48:39.510 --> 05:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
oh goodness
 
05:48:41.760 --> 05:48:42.868 align:start position:0%
oh goodness
well

05:48:42.868 --> 05:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
if it comes back to me i'll raise my
 
05:48:46.470 --> 05:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
hand again but for the moment anyways i
 
05:48:46.480 --> 05:48:47.350 align:start position:0%
hand again but for the moment anyways i
wanted

05:48:47.350 --> 05:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
05:48:49.190 --> 05:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
i would make clear that i'm opposed to
 
05:48:53.110 --> 05:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:58.548 --> 05:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:00.788 --> 05:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
i'll add something on this um
 
05:49:02.070 --> 05:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
i looked at this at the beginning not
 
05:49:03.590 --> 05:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
sure what to think
 
05:49:04.948 --> 05:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
but as we had the hearing it just
 
05:49:06.470 --> 05:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
started becoming easier and easier to
 
05:49:07.830 --> 05:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
support this
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
um even with the increase of 40 000
 
05:49:11.990 --> 05:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
pounds per axle it puts us
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
actually in the middle of the road if
 
05:49:16.470 --> 05:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
you excuse the transportation
 
05:49:18.230 --> 05:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
of the two northern states within the
 
05:49:21.430 --> 05:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
states up north vermont and maine
 
05:49:23.110 --> 05:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh and i can certainly see where we've
 
05:49:25.030 --> 05:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
been significantly lower and truck
 
05:49:26.788 --> 05:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
weights would be a problem for anybody
 
05:49:29.190 --> 05:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
that does business over the borders
 
05:49:31.270 --> 05:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
i also understand a little bit on how
 
05:49:34.070 --> 05:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
these trucks are loaded uneven surfaces
 
05:49:35.670 --> 05:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
the materials they put in them are not
 
05:49:37.190 --> 05:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
always easy to
 
05:49:39.030 --> 05:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
perfectly in
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
these trucks
 
05:49:42.788 --> 05:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
and then i was surprised to see how many
 
05:49:46.830 --> 05:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:49.670 --> 05:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
so the only thing i still had left as a
 
05:49:51.030 --> 05:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
concern is what it might do with the
 
05:49:53.430 --> 05:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
roads and it was during the testimony
 
05:49:55.190 --> 05:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we heard it was a great question i
 
05:49:57.350 --> 05:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
don't know who asked it
 
05:49:58.948 --> 05:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
but they said is this going to increase
 
05:50:01.910 --> 05:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
the frequency or require the roads to be
 
05:50:03.750 --> 05:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
repaired at a higher frequency than they
 
05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
currently are and the answer was no
 
05:50:06.958 --> 05:50:08.230 align:start position:0%
currently are and the answer was no
so

05:50:08.230 --> 05:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:09.910 --> 05:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh i thought that was the department of
 
05:50:09.920 --> 05:50:11.350 align:start position:0%
uh i thought that was the department of
transportation

05:50:11.350 --> 05:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
05:50:11.360 --> 05:50:12.310 align:start position:0%
transportation
so

05:50:12.310 --> 05:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:14.708 --> 05:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
it was mr rodriguez i didn't write it
 
05:50:16.310 --> 05:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
down but that he was the only one who
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
testified against it that day
 
05:50:22.070 --> 05:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
so for all the reasons i i don't see
 
05:50:22.080 --> 05:50:23.190 align:start position:0%
so for all the reasons i i don't see
this

05:50:23.190 --> 05:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:50:25.590 --> 05:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
as a problem and i asked the committee
 
05:50:33.750 --> 05:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:36.310 --> 05:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman my poor feeble
 
05:50:38.310 --> 05:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
brain finally remembered the other point
 
05:50:41.190 --> 05:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to make um
 
05:50:45.430 --> 05:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns too is
 
05:50:47.830 --> 05:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
this will begin a carve out procedure
 
05:50:47.840 --> 05:50:48.948 align:start position:0%
this will begin a carve out procedure
for

05:50:48.948 --> 05:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:50:51.990 --> 05:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
various industries to no longer comply
 
05:50:52.000 --> 05:50:52.948 align:start position:0%
various industries to no longer comply
with

05:50:52.948 --> 05:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:50:54.788 --> 05:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
certain requirements
 
05:50:57.270 --> 05:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
we've seen this in other industries
 
05:50:59.030 --> 05:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
where we had an original
 
05:51:01.990 --> 05:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
weight limit posting for roads uh that
 
05:51:04.868 --> 05:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
was for essentially all trucks but
 
05:51:07.270 --> 05:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
we carved out
 
05:51:09.670 --> 05:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
fuel trucks and then ultimately we also
 
05:51:12.470 --> 05:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
carved out milk trucks and
 
05:51:14.548 --> 05:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
this i worry that this is a slippery
 
05:51:14.558 --> 05:51:15.510 align:start position:0%
this i worry that this is a slippery
slope

05:51:15.510 --> 05:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
slope
 
05:51:17.430 --> 05:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we go down and so that was the
 
05:51:19.030 --> 05:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
other point that i wanted to make
 
05:51:20.628 --> 05:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:51:21.990 --> 05:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
05:51:37.030 --> 05:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:40.150 --> 05:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
anytime you represent we can't hear you
 
05:51:41.670 --> 05:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
05:51:42.788 --> 05:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
now we can
 
05:51:44.470 --> 05:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
i guess i doubled it
 
05:51:46.708 --> 05:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
um anyways i just wanted to say that i
 
05:51:48.868 --> 05:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
i'm voting in support of this bill
 
05:51:48.878 --> 05:51:50.070 align:start position:0%
i'm voting in support of this bill
partially

05:51:50.070 --> 05:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
partially
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
out of being educated by my own
 
05:51:51.840 --> 05:51:53.590 align:start position:0%
out of being educated by my own
constituents

05:51:53.590 --> 05:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
05:51:55.910 --> 05:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
i didn't have any prior knowledge going
 
05:51:55.920 --> 05:51:57.270 align:start position:0%
i didn't have any prior knowledge going
into

05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:51:59.350 --> 05:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
the advisability of this
 
05:52:02.310 --> 05:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
but when my local constituents educated
 
05:52:05.750 --> 05:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
me as to how it actually affect
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
the logging industry which is quite
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
important in one of my towns
 
05:52:13.350 --> 05:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
it convinced me that this bill is worth
 
05:52:17.350 --> 05:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:20.230 --> 05:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:22.868 --> 05:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman i did find a note from
 
05:52:25.830 --> 05:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
that i took relative to the testimony of
 
05:52:27.510 --> 05:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
dave rodrigue from the new hampshire
 
05:52:27.520 --> 05:52:28.548 align:start position:0%
dave rodrigue from the new hampshire
d.o.t

05:52:28.548 --> 05:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
d.o.t
 
05:52:30.070 --> 05:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that he did say
 
05:52:31.350 --> 05:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
was that a 10
 
05:52:32.788 --> 05:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
weight increase
 
05:52:35.190 --> 05:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
yields a one and a half times increase
 
05:52:37.510 --> 05:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
on the impact on roads
 
05:52:40.070 --> 05:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
and he also brought up the concept of
 
05:52:42.470 --> 05:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:44.788 --> 05:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
adding you know different
 
05:52:46.708 --> 05:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
adding different industries to the
 
05:52:49.350 --> 05:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
exemptions make it more difficult
 
05:52:51.270 --> 05:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
for compliance even
 
05:52:54.230 --> 05:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
but anyways thank you sir
 
05:52:56.470 --> 05:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you

on personal rapid transit
 
05:55:00.708 --> 05:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman thank you for um checking
 
05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
in with me
 
05:55:04.150 --> 05:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
as a matter of
 
05:55:07.270 --> 05:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
general concern i i don't like um
 
05:55:09.190 --> 05:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
executing bills on the same day that we
 
05:55:12.230 --> 05:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
hear them that said i i don't
 
05:55:13.750 --> 05:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
see that we'll have any particular
 
05:55:16.150 --> 05:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
problems with either of these bills but
 
05:55:18.628 --> 05:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
i will just continue to make my
 
05:55:23.350 --> 05:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:25.990 --> 05:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
have some time to
 
05:55:26.000 --> 05:55:26.788 align:start position:0%
have some time to
to

05:55:26.788 --> 05:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:55:29.670 --> 05:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
absorb the arguments that we heard and
 
05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
if we had further questions to check in
 
05:55:32.868 --> 05:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
with the people who
 
05:55:32.878 --> 05:55:34.070 align:start position:0%
with the people who
um

05:55:34.070 --> 05:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:37.190 --> 05:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
testified and then vote on it so
 
05:55:39.270 --> 05:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
objection noted
 
05:55:40.470 --> 05:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
there we are
 
05:55:42.310 --> 05:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
fair enough and i think i've been fair
 
05:55:44.548 --> 05:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
all along um i wouldn't take these two
 
05:55:46.230 --> 05:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
up if i thought there was any question
 
05:55:47.350 --> 05:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
on them
 
05:55:48.628 --> 05:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
i just think uh
 
05:55:50.628 --> 05:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
because one's already house position and
 
05:55:52.470 --> 05:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
the other one i think they'll be fine
 
05:55:54.070 --> 05:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
with the motion
 
05:55:54.080 --> 05:55:55.110 align:start position:0%
with the motion
um

05:55:55.110 --> 05:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:56.708 --> 05:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
just actually
 
05:55:58.310 --> 05:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
helps me and helps the committee just
 
05:56:00.390 --> 05:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
move along with our processes and i've
 
05:56:02.310 --> 05:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
been very cognizant to make sure
 
05:56:03.670 --> 05:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
everybody's got the time to do their
 
05:56:03.680 --> 05:56:04.708 align:start position:0%
everybody's got the time to do their
research

05:56:04.708 --> 05:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
research
 
05:56:04.718 --> 05:56:05.430 align:start position:0%
research
so

05:56:05.430 --> 05:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:56:06.868 --> 05:56:06.878 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
05:56:18.150 --> 05:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:21.430 --> 05:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes
 
05:56:23.510 --> 05:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative smith for a motion thank
 
05:56:25.430 --> 05:56:25.440 align:start position:0%

05:56:27.830 --> 05:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
bill 104
 
05:56:29.670 --> 05:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
have a second
 
05:56:29.680 --> 05:56:30.788 align:start position:0%
have a second
second

05:56:30.788 --> 05:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:56:32.230 --> 05:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay i got three
 
05:56:34.470 --> 05:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative crawford that you put you
 
05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
both first
 
05:56:37.990 --> 05:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
but you wish to speak emotion
 
05:56:40.548 --> 05:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
yeah uh same rationale as last time i
 
05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
don't need the committee to accomplish
 
05:56:45.670 --> 05:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
the goal which is to get manufacturers
 
05:56:47.270 --> 05:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
and conveyors of these interesting
 
05:56:50.470 --> 05:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
systems to come in here present and get
 
05:56:52.230 --> 05:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
a group of people that i know will make
 
05:56:54.310 --> 05:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
a good decision to decide if it's
 
05:56:56.628 --> 05:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
vaporware or not
 
05:56:58.310 --> 05:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's one that might be interesting
 
05:56:59.750 --> 05:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's based in new hampshire a
 
05:57:02.390 --> 05:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
lightweight rail system i don't need
 
05:57:05.670 --> 05:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
that involved i need you all to help us
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
see if there's anything we can do
 
05:57:08.638 --> 05:57:09.990 align:start position:0%
see if there's anything we can do
so

05:57:09.990 --> 05:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:11.670 --> 05:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
we'll put the move
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:20.230 --> 05:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i would i would
 
05:57:21.990 --> 05:57:22.000 align:start position:0%

and the hard work that he's trying to do
 
05:57:30.390 --> 05:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
on these these types of issues i have
 
05:57:32.150 --> 05:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
always believed that
 
05:57:33.590 --> 05:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
one of the important roles of the
 
05:57:35.830 --> 05:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
transportation committee is to to take a
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
look at
 
05:57:36.798 --> 05:57:39.190 align:start position:0%
look at
um

05:57:39.190 --> 05:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:41.030 --> 05:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
different transportation
 
05:57:42.868 --> 05:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
problems and how they may be solved
 
05:57:45.670 --> 05:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
rather than just specific types
 
05:57:45.680 --> 05:57:46.470 align:start position:0%
rather than just specific types
um

05:57:46.470 --> 05:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:47.830 --> 05:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:57:49.830 --> 05:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
and also that we should be always be
 
05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:57:53.510 --> 05:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
improvements in technology that will
 
05:57:53.520 --> 05:57:54.708 align:start position:0%
improvements in technology that will
help

05:57:54.708 --> 05:57:54.718 align:start position:0%

05:57:56.868 --> 05:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
our citizens and and the transportation
 
05:57:59.110 --> 05:57:59.120 align:start position:0%

yes

06:01:59.750 --> 06:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:02:01.350 --> 06:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
is that in fox
 
06:02:01.360 --> 06:02:02.230 align:start position:0%
is that in fox
yes

06:02:02.230 --> 06:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:02:03.910 --> 06:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
senator stevens
 
06:02:06.230 --> 06:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
06:02:12.390 --> 06:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
i heard that move to consent
 
06:02:15.600 --> 06:02:17.110 align:start position:0%
i heard that move to consent
yes

06:02:17.110 --> 06:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:02:23.190 --> 06:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:25.830 --> 06:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
the executive is on house bill 461
 
06:02:27.430 --> 06:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
agreements it's only 10 past three we
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
could do another half a dozen
 
06:02:32.470 --> 06:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:34.230 --> 06:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
just a couple of notes for the good of
 
06:02:37.030 --> 06:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
the cause before we go
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh you've probably seen it there's only
 
06:02:40.470 --> 06:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
three bills that made it in the calendar
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
this week i did some inquiring and it
 
06:02:44.948 --> 06:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
looks like several of the committees
 
06:02:46.390 --> 06:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
were dealing with the same thing it
 
06:02:47.830 --> 06:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
looks like the early bills which is what
 
06:02:50.708 --> 06:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
the bed line is looming for for these
 
06:02:54.310 --> 06:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
two days uh they did take priority uh so
 
06:02:55.990 --> 06:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
we would have an overly extensive
 
06:02:58.868 --> 06:02:58.878 align:start position:0%
calendar we do have more processed uh
 
06:03:00.310 --> 06:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
they're just waiting for the next
 
06:03:00.320 --> 06:03:01.830 align:start position:0%
they're just waiting for the next
calendar

06:03:01.830 --> 06:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
06:03:04.230 --> 06:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of our schedule those two
 
06:03:05.990 --> 06:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
session days of putting a change on to
 
06:03:07.990 --> 06:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
that also
 
06:03:08.000 --> 06:03:09.590 align:start position:0%
that also
i

06:03:09.590 --> 06:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:03:09.600 --> 06:03:10.548 align:start position:0%
i
believe

06:03:10.548 --> 06:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
believe
 
06:03:12.070 --> 06:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
and again this
 
06:03:13.430 --> 06:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
is what they'd even say because i'm not
 
06:03:13.440 --> 06:03:14.628 align:start position:0%
is what they'd even say because i'm not
sure

06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:03:16.150 --> 06:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
where we stand now we only have three
 
06:03:17.670 --> 06:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
bills left to here we're in pretty good
 
06:03:17.680 --> 06:03:18.548 align:start position:0%
bills left to here we're in pretty good
shape

06:03:18.548 --> 06:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
shape
 
06:03:21.590 --> 06:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh so my plan is for two more days
 
06:03:24.230 --> 06:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
we can hear our first three bills
 
06:03:25.670 --> 06:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
do some executing on the ones we've
 
06:03:27.030 --> 06:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
heard today and i think there's one or
 
06:03:29.750 --> 06:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
two that are still in limbo
 
06:03:32.070 --> 06:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
then not the following day one other day
 
06:03:34.788 --> 06:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
just to do an executive session mop up
 
06:03:36.788 --> 06:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
if you will for any bills and of course
 
06:03:39.030 --> 06:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to leave some time in between
 
06:03:42.310 --> 06:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh between the three that we hear and
 
06:03:46.628 --> 06:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:49.670 --> 06:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
again it's because of the 24th and 25th
 
06:03:51.110 --> 06:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's changing the schedule i haven't
 
06:03:53.270 --> 06:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
got a definitive answer on what days
 
06:03:55.670 --> 06:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
this room is available to me yet but i
 
06:03:59.110 --> 06:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
will let you know the second that i do
 
06:04:01.670 --> 06:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
so that's where we're at
 
06:04:03.830 --> 06:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question about schedule
 
06:04:03.840 --> 06:04:05.110 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question about schedule
sure

06:04:05.110 --> 06:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:04:07.350 --> 06:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
just looking at the calendar um i know
 
06:04:09.590 --> 06:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
that there's the deadline to pass things
 
06:04:11.910 --> 06:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
off is it the
 
06:04:14.150 --> 06:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
march 11th
 
06:04:15.830 --> 06:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
so that means we have to be all done
 
06:04:18.548 --> 06:04:18.558 align:start position:0%
before march 11th
 
06:04:21.030 --> 06:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay there was there was a probably an
 
06:04:23.190 --> 06:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
oversight by everybody thursdays used to
 
06:04:24.868 --> 06:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
be the end of business because we never
 
06:04:27.430 --> 06:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
did business on friday before uh in
 
06:04:28.868 --> 06:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
hindsight we could have made a change to
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
make the deadline of the 12th therefore
 
06:04:33.030 --> 06:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
we could have met on the 12th
 
06:04:35.350 --> 06:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
didn't happen so yes that second and
 
06:04:37.030 --> 06:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
second week there's a very good chance
 
06:04:39.030 --> 06:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
um well not a very good chance the
 
06:04:41.990 --> 06:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
definite chance will be having her
 
06:04:44.788 --> 06:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
prior to the 11th
 
06:04:47.910 --> 06:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
and then my other question is
 
06:04:49.590 --> 06:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry chairman
 
06:04:51.910 --> 06:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
um my other question is is is there
 
06:04:54.628 --> 06:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
usually a little bit of lag time before
 
06:04:56.948 --> 06:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
we start getting bills
 
06:04:58.628 --> 06:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
from the senate
 
06:05:01.430 --> 06:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah there is uh but if it's any
 
06:05:03.670 --> 06:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
consolation i've heard
 
06:05:05.110 --> 06:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
through sources that we're not going to
 
06:05:07.110 --> 06:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
be seeing many i heard the number three
 
06:05:08.788 --> 06:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
being mentioned
 
06:05:10.310 --> 06:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
i agree because i was looking that's why
 
06:05:11.510 --> 06:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if we might have a
 
06:05:13.190 --> 06:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
little break
 
06:05:15.430 --> 06:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i believe we will i can't tell you
 
06:05:16.788 --> 06:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
how much for certain
 
06:05:19.430 --> 06:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
but only three bills on our plate uh i'm
 
06:05:22.230 --> 06:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
sure we can budget in a break
 
06:05:23.910 --> 06:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:05:26.310 --> 06:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:05:28.150 --> 06:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
