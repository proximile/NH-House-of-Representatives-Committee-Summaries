00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
so uh the other thing is uh I got a uh I
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
spoke to Lou alisandra over the weekend
 
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
he was in the hospital all last week um
 
00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
he thought he was going to try to make
 
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
it but his assistant uh gave me a buzz
 
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
and said that that's not going to happen
 
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
today so I let her know that this is
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
being live streamed that he could
 
00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 align:start position:0%
probably view it if he's up to it so I
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
just want to let everybody know that
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
that's the only um other member that I
 
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
heard from that could not make the
 
00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:13.029 align:start position:0%
heard from that could not make the
meeting

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
today uh first order business is to
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
approve the minutes uh of the last
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
meeting um I'm I'm going to turn that
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
over to you uh representative Jan again
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
that does um yes thank you Mr chair does
 
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
everyone have the um yes they were
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
handed out okay and and they were
 
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
distributed ahead of time
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right um I guess does anyone
 
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
have any changes we a motion let's make
 
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
Bry take a
 
00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
second um okay does anyone have any any
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
deletions no okay looks like
 
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
none no so I don't do you say all in
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
favor or do I say all in favor I'll do
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
it all in favor of uh the motion I
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
opposed no okay minut minutes are
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
adopted all right um we had given uh Mr
 
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
McIntyre um a list of things to to work
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
on and he's come through again um I have
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
some other embellishments I'm going to
 
00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
do a little later on on on U on certain
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
things but uh Charlie do you want to
 
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
come up and I know you you brought us
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
the the glossery and things like that if
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
you want to just
 
00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 align:start position:0%
explain actually one of the best things
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
about my job is I have folks to do this
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
too so um our folks put together a
 
00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 align:start position:0%
glossery of terms um this is sort of the
 
00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
vernacular of gambling in many respects
 
00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 align:start position:0%
if you want want to go over them there's
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
more than this uh if you are interested
 
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
there are a number of websites that do
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
this uh I didn't think you all needed to
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
know what vigorish or cooler was um or
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
other terms like that so I I we edited
 
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
it out as as needed um but certainly
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
this isn't a bad way to start in terms
 
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
of understanding what difference between
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
handle and hold and and the equivalent
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
so um you know using good
 
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%
health so this is something you should
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
bring to every meeting so you'd have it
 
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
in your back pocket so you can yeah
 
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.070 align:start position:0%
in your back pocket so you can yeah
yes

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
yes about this um are
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
these are these um words these
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
references this these terms um used
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
consistently for the most part yes for
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
the most part mean there are a couple of
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
critical ones like uh gross Gaming
 
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
revenue and handle and um yeah and I
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
sort of sometimes have the impression
 
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
that some items are being subtracted by
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
and other places or not um would you
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
encountered that have you encountered
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
that I have actually to that point
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
um in Lottery World versus Cass say
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
Casino world will use terms differently
 
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
um and will manage them differently like
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
for example um when we say gross
 
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
wagering on lottery we would mean the
 
00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
actual overall SE sales so when we say
 
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
Powerball sales we would say gross
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
overall sales would be say this year $57
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
million whereas that would be termed
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
handle in machines yeah so um other than
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
know minor differences in terms of our
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
businesses there's not that much
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
difference and at the end of the day if
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
you you're ever wondering uh Resa of
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
Ames you can just sort of look at the
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
way the math works like the obviously
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
there's a funnel effect to gambling it's
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
the top of the funnel and then how it
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
gets distributed down obviously
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
virtually every gambling game I can
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
think of prizes is the highest expense
 
00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:10.519 align:start position:0%
and then from
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
there and these are
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh kind of linked to our
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
statutes the the definitions are
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
consistent with this what the definition
 
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
of statutes yeah and one of the
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
difficult things is that Hampshire laws
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
are sort of in some respects sort of old
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
right and that the word Casino only
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
appears as a house of ill Fame I think
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh In Like A Pill from 1827 or something
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
and so you there's no when I'm asked to
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
Define what a casino is we can't Define
 
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
it because the law doesn't Define it it
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
defines it as a triable gaming facility
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
so that's what we call it and I brought
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
that up last meeting that everybody's
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
calling their facilities not Char gaming
 
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
locations but they're calling themselves
 
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
casinos and that's something I think we
 
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
have to address eventually here in this
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
commission that are we going to we're
 
00:09:57.069 --> 00:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
going to if they're going to call
 
00:09:58.269 --> 00:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
themselves casinos I think we should
 
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
have it in the statute as casinos um but
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's for down the road uh the
 
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
one thing I was going to open with and I
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
uh was that what we got to do here is be
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
fair to everybody involved in this
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
whether it's the Charities the
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
facilities the state the players
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
themselves as well as the communities
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
and the communities has come up again
 
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
I've gotten some calls about that so uh
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
again we're going to be addressing all
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
the issues and over time we have a year
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
to do this and uh and we we'll get it
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
right okay all right so uh the third
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
bullet is uh the the revenue I had asked
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
Charlie the last time
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh Mr
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
McIntyre uh we we you gave us uh
 
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
actually allocations by percentage but I
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
thought it'd be and I I thought it' be
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
helpful if we had dollars assigned to it
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
to follow the dollar
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
to make it more real and and you did a
 
00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:05.079 align:start position:0%
nice job of coming up with a chart here
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh that does that uh do you want to
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
explain the the chart sure it's rather
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
basic a break once again this is the
 
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
benefit of having folks who do this for
 
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
living that are far more talented than I
 
00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:16.839 align:start position:0%
am this was from our compliance and
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
investigations division um a breakdown
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
sort of in three categories how the
 
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
revenues are distributed uh first
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
through poker tournaments how much funds
 
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
are collected from players essentially
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
that's through a rake
 
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
um table games uh that's the revenue
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
obviously that the house wins and is
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
split accordingly and the second page is
 
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
HHR Revenue
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
distribution um the total handle which
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
once again is the amount of wagering
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
activity and then how that split up um
 
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
between the operator the charity and the
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
state this is for a month one of the
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
reasons we we wanted to do a month is
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
because the revenues specifically to HHR
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
are accelerating um with a significant
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
velocity so um it would be an incorrect
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
number for last fiscal year because we
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
much much lower than the current run
 
00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue okay so uh people are going to
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
see that the game operators get 75% of
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
the commission yes um and that charal
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
organizations get you know
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
945 just for the month of September um
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
thousand and Lottery gets 1.7 million
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
now let's explain that to so that we all
 
00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:41.959 align:start position:0%
understand that I mean that that
 
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
lotteries portion goes to oversight
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
correct can you explain that sure um the
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
oversight involved in charal gambling um
 
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
is not that expensive and so really what
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
this does is and I will also back out a
 
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
second a number of of our employees uh
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
with John cordi who's our chief
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
compliance officer manage other things
 
00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
as well and so it would be a waste of
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
time to have a charitable
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
gambling Auditors and investigators
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
because they're in the same rooms anyway
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
investigating sports betting and Lottery
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
and the rest and so it's an overall
 
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
function that we manage through the
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
state budget process and so this just
 
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
goes as transfers education for the
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
state and so for example last year and
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sure chairman Lang will be happy
 
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
about this last year we were supposed to
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
transfer 139 million and we transferred
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
187 and so this literally just goes to
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
extra transfers to the state for
 
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
Education trust fund so after the
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
expense of of Regulation correct correct
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
correct and um so there's still a
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount going to the trust
 
00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:50.759 align:start position:0%
fund yeah and so HHR is not like our
 
00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
biggest Revenue source is still scratch
 
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
tickets it's around $50 million annually
 
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
profitability uh second I think last
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
year was sports betting at 38 million
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
and so those are our big sort of tent
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
pole things okay
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
yes on the Bott so the bottom left hand
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
side the 1.7 million that you have there
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
there actually two boxes that should go
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
underneath that one box is your expense
 
00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
if there are any charge to HHR and that
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
and then second box is what's returned
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund yeah well
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
exactly we don't split it up like that
 
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
certainly the the same folks who audit
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
will'll audit a a room or we'll audit um
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
a charity They Don't Really break out
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
how time they spent on HR versus how
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
much time they spent on games of chance
 
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
but certainly you're right there is an
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
expense there thank
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to focus on the the uh the
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
eight8 million for a minute now um just
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
this morning I got a I got uh an email
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
from the uh New Hampshire gaming New
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gaming uh charal gaming
 
00:14:53.079 --> 00:14:54.230 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gaming uh charal gaming
operations

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
Association and they they produced this
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
for us um somebody from the association
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
want to just oh I think uh Aaron you you
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
want to explain this to us yes I could I
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
could walk you through it um so I think
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
the most important thing here is um the
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
difference between handle and revenue
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
right when you read a lot of press
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
nowadays and they're just ill informed
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
and they talk about the money coming in
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
the handle as if the operators are
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
taking that as Revenue that's not the
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
case at all right as you can see 90% of
 
00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:30.519 align:start position:0%
all the money that's wagered goes back
 
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
to the player then 2 and a half% on HHR
 
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
Machines of that Revenue so 25% of the
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
revenue goes to the between the charity
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
and the state about
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
2.1% or 21% of the revenue um is towards
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
Labor uh roughly 2% uh goes towards the
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
HHR technology fees so when comparing
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
this to class three games like in
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Maine they don't have have
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
the HHR technology fee so it's pretty
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
unique to uh to New Hampshire in the um
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
Northeast uh about 2% go towards
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
marketing or advertising marketing
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
advertising in free play so that's uh
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
everything from tv ads newspaper ads to
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
free play to similar to coupons can you
 
00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:22.759 align:start position:0%
explain free play please I'm sorry can
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
you explain for yeah so it's like a
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
coupon uh every every operator in New
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire use it goes you mail it out
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
and says come in based on your historic
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%

get $10 in free play so it's free slot
 
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
handle okay thank you um and then about
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
1.4% left over for the operator that
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
covers debt rent other taxes utilities
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
Insurance operating supplies and that's
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
what the company retains anything left
 
00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
for profits and uh important to note
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
here this is not exactly ours it's not
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
exactly any other operator this is
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
General in terms of our experience and
 
00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
and what we see so well the good news
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
here is that the handle on this
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
Charlie's for September is the same
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
handle here so the starting points were
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
the same yeah um but some people are
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
going to look at that 8 million and
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
still have some concern so how come
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's when they say there's 2.1%
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
Labor uh for for this but isn't the
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
machines of the machines you you the
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
technolog is being covered than another
 
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
bucket MH what labor are we talking
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
about here so that's everything from
 
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
surveillance to Auditors
 
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
to uh slot technician or sorry HHR
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
technicians to um it cashiers it's what
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
we have to spend to run the business but
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
are some of those things uh both for the
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
table games as well as the HHR that you
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
have you in the bookkeeping you split it
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
out that way uh correct correct yeah
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
right okay chairman yep no the 2% under
 
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
marketing advertising free play is that
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
take into account the statutory offset
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
for promotional uh yes correct so it's
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
still 2% even though you get to offset
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
promotional monies correct okay
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think again this is one of the
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
issues that the commission's got to deal
 
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
with is is is the in this chart is the 8
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
million a fair amount either way is it
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
the fair amount and that's something
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
that I think the commission is going to
 
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
you this 2.1% labor now is
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
that is that like um what you allow them
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
to spend and what happens if they're
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
over or under what happens with the
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
money that's either overspent or under
 
00:18:58.029 --> 00:18:58.039 align:start position:0%
spent so who makes up for it they go
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
over are 2.1 so the labor is not
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
mandated by anyone that's just what on
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
average each operator as a percentage of
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
Revenue is spending on labor in their
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
business out of their abortion uh well I
 
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919 align:start position:0%
guess you could say out of the revenue
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
correct okay and and that also goes for
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
the rent and other taxes and
 
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
everything sorry I'm not sure I
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
understand the question so what if what
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
if uh they get into a place with real
 
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
high rent that goes over the 1.4 with
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
the uh with all of these the rent and
 
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
the taxes and the insurance and
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
everything goes over the
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
1.4% that again comes out of the The
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
Operators so these are kind of rough
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
numbers like I mentioned certain of our
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
properties we own so we don't pay rent
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
certain properties we rent and we we do
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
pay rent right so these are kind of
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
averages if you look at the other oper
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
across the entire State um what
 
00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559 align:start position:0%
operators are are likely spending based
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
on our history and what we're spending
 
00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:03.559 align:start position:0%
and discussions with other operators so
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
it's they're rough numbers my question
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
was this is adjusted out of the
 
00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:10.830 align:start position:0%
was this is adjusted out of the
operator's

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
operator's
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
income yes so that entire percentage
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
here 10% is the operator's income okay
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
and that's what all of these allocations
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
are coming out of okay thank you you're
 
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you yeah the the question
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
is the big big picture question is how
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
much is this one up profit to the to the
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
owners of these facilities and that's
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
what the public wants to know is it is
 
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
it a fair amount and the rest of it yes
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
we understand that there's a cost of of
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
a business there's a risk that they're
 
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
taking by opening a business uh but just
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to get a sense and down the road
 
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking more about
 
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
this uh how do we get our hands around
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
around uh uh whether this is a fair
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
number that we've come up with uh in the
 
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
original legislation for HHR that's all
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
Mr L Aaron just to be clear so you're
 
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
really talking about 7.5% of the overall
 
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
hand of of the overall handle is what
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
you have to work with correct for
 
00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:11.799 align:start position:0%
operating expenses of your gaming
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
operator and that may any given month
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
shift a little bit between these numbers
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
but you're still dealing with whatever
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
the handle is 7 and a half% of the gross
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
out of 100% right you keeping 7 a half%
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
and of that you have to divide all of
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
these models out in you know like your
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
HHR techi is probably pretty standard
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
right that's going to be a static number
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
game over game over game right for the
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
machine but other numbers like labor may
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
change or your your um you know your
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
marketing May adjust to deal with the
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
fact that you have higher labor costs in
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
a given month or if that correct yes
 
00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:45.789 align:start position:0%
a given month or if that correct yes
thank

00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
you representative w i mean the
 
00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.230 align:start position:0%
you representative w i mean the
representative

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I I have a couple of questions
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
but first uh who who did this this is
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
very helpful so that's first I want to
 
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
say that the association the association
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire Charter ball
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
gaming operators Association that's Rick
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
Newman and Alicia Preston okay Alicia's
 
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
here all right
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
um and then I'm I'm wondering if it's
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
possible uh to maybe we'll get to this
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
down the line but uh i' I'd like to see
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
a similar um display that relates
 
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
to slot machine based
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
Casino um like the one in central
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in Plan F and how that
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
plays out I know the tax rates are
 
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
different but showing that whole thing
 
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
uh would be helpful I think well later
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
in the agenda we have one one and a half
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
million to one and a half million
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
150,000 to bring in Consultants to help
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
us out and this may be one of the ways
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
we we use them we'll have that
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
yeah does the uh amount here for that
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
the uh the operator
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
holds are they then charging rent to the
 
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
HHR um yes so as part yes that that
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
would not be included that would be in
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
other Revenue that'd be part of so so
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that basically be ented in
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
here in that the operator is getting a
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
addal dollars if you want from the
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
charity so that the charity is not cruly
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
getting part of that 2.5 if you want
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
that to set aside for the charity and
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
the uh and the state but I would say to
 
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
that technically we're not charging none
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
of the operator charging rent for
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
HHR okay we're going to have a long
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
discussion in a minute about about rent
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
rent is going to be the focus of today
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
the rent that they the Charities are
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
paying is is really the top uh thing
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking about so we'll
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
hold that until until then okay but what
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
on your chart the one under the 1.4 when
 
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
you say rent you're talking about
 
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
renting the facility cost renting the
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
property right renting the property or
 
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
the debt would be you know the
 
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
amotization of of the if you bought it
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
okay so all right so uh any other
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
questions on
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
this now thank you Charlie it's a good
 
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
oh yes J yeah thank you Mr chair I just
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
had a question the so the 90% that goes
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
to the player that that's just is that a
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
rough number or is
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%
that basically law of averages every
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
dollar that goes in about approximately
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
90% goes back some a little more some a
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
little less okay so then
 
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
um this isn't necessarily a question for
 
00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
you then when I look at the example I
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
guess that U Mr McIntyre brought where
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
the total handle 121 million uh uh and
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
change and then the commission takeout
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
is 10 milon 811 is that what I mean I
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
just calculated it to be about 88.8% I
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
mean is
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
that is there an absolute number or
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:27.799 align:start position:0%
no so that number Al is also like an
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:34.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay overall for the current run rate
 
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
amount of gr giving Revenue be 130
 
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:48.590 align:start position:0%
amount of gr giving Revenue be 130
Milli

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.389 align:start position:0%
okay okay
thanks

00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.269 --> 00:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
yeah you it okay um
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
I have one more question Charlie so
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
Charlie are we seeing and I know this is
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
early and you just talked about
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
accelerating rates are we seeing any
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
kind of ratio or any kind of change to
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
GOC for
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
HHR not yet but it's early and one of
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
the things is that we put into rule is
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
that there has to be a table to machine
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
ratio as well as a machine to table
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
ratio in terms of profitability uh and
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
there are some as I think I've told the
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
folks of this committee before we're the
 
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
last stop on the line so we keep hearing
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
rumors about massive facilities
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
elsewhere uh that we haven't seen yet
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
all we've heard is press reports and so
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
once those happen I'd imagine we'll see
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
a change it was certainly our ardan fear
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
is because the labor costs for table
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
games are much higher than machines they
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
just are um and the Charities obviously
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
do better with games at chance than they
 
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
do with his stor hor racing they get 35
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
cents in the dollar versus eight and so
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
our fear was that operators threw no
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
fault of the their own but certainly
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
with business motive would want have
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
machines and not do table games and so
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
um our fear is that will be they will
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
try to push the envelope that way
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
certainly operators have asked to wave
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
that provision a number of them have and
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
we've declined so it's our to your point
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
Senator it's a deep fear we have so the
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
concern again is that we're as as HHR is
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
expanded um we'll see games of chance
 
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
decline we has to stay equal now
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
but certainly I'm always fearful of what
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know so we have have we hit has
 
00:27:35.389 --> 00:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
any any operator hit the ratio yet come
 
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
close come some have come close yes but
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
you and can but to that point the
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
facility in Nashville which is alleged
 
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
to have 1,200 machines I do not know how
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
they do tables to the same ratio I just
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't not with the labor issues that all
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the operators have regarding dealers
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
and and staff it's just they just not
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
big enough
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
pool one more question yeah follow is
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
that ratio a monthly ratio or is that
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
just uh per day per charity how how's it
 
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
per uh it's I think it's if I recall
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
believe it's per my month per month per
 
00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
month and then if they exceed it they
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
have to give the money to their charity
 
00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:18.070 align:start position:0%
have to give the money to their charity
thank

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
you Charlie just for the committee can
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
you explain the fees to the third party
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
vendor um because unlike slot machines
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
the the the track owners are providing
 
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
all of these uh uh pre pre-run races
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
yeah uh and there's a certain fee that's
 
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
associated with that can you can you
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
just for the edification everybody here
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
can you explain that certainly if I mind
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to refer this to our chief
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
compliance officer who deals with this
 
00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
regularly okay I don't want him to
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
attend here without actually doing
 
00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
something it's good having people to
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful having I'm telling you
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's the best it's the best in life I
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
thought I was going to escape but um
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
John 40 Chief compliance officer in New
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lottery
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
um so you from our perspective as the
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
regulator what we understand is that um
 
00:29:06.669 --> 00:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
The Operators obviously contract with
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
both game providers and then the
 
00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
terminal providers um some of them
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
choose to lease that equipment um and
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
pay on a percentage basis on a uh
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
monthly some buy it obviously there's a
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
cost associated with that that I'm sure
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
gets amortised over time so um I'm sure
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
Mr goes could give you more specifics on
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
the uh you know on the equipment uh
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
expense with respect to that but um that
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
would be my understanding of what that
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
representing yes you sorry did you want
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
me um so there's really two large
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
operators in the HHR space um system
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
wise so exact uh and answorth and the
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
general models I mean based on volumes
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
Etc like anything in in business the
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
more you buy the more you have the lower
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
those rates can go but in general if you
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
lease the product from them so you don't
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
spend the $220,000 per game you pay a
 
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
20% technology fee that can be
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
negotiated down if you put money up
 
00:30:10.029 --> 00:30:10.039 align:start position:0%
front to buy the boxes you could get
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
that down to somewhere around probably
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
12% based on again volume and operator
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
so do most of the facilities uh lease
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
these machines or do they they purchase
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
them I guess you can speak to your fa
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I can I can only speak to us for us
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
were're we well capitalized so we buy
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
them generally um but I would say most
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the facilities across the state off
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
the top of my head would probably
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
especially the smaller ones would would
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
lease them right then when you buy them
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
is there a uh maintenance fee that you
 
00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:47.559 align:start position:0%
pay it's at at least 20% 12% 12% that
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
you pay that's what you're talking about
 
00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
there okay all right any other questions
 
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
on this one I just want to try to get
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff out early on so we
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
understand what we're talking about
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
again important distinction between
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
class three they have no ongoing fees
 
00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
you buy a box and you put in or you
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
lease a box and you don't have the
 
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing fees like you do here when you
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
when you when you do the uh maintenance
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
fee they will Pro provide you technical
 
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
support if there's a
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
problem you pick up the phone you say
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
hey we got a and they'll go in from afar
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
and look into the machine and see what's
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
going on correct and they do have some
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
fees I believe it's called Equibase I
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
don't know you may uh that they have to
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
pay ongoing for the use of the
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
historical um horse races right that's
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
correct there's um the the data the
 
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
horse race data um is a separate
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
contractor that the uh toe providers
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
also have to pay to keep that database
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh updated um so that's um that's a fee
 
00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:47.799 align:start position:0%
that's baked in and I think rolled into
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
the fee that the operators ultimately
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
pay yeah talk about the totalizer think
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
how that all works can I mean so there
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
goes maybe you're not the guy to talk
 
00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
about this but so so there's some
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
central location where all these race
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
all prior races are are
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
held uh big database I would imagine can
 
00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
you just talk touch on that yeah so the
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
totalizer is basically the system that
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
operates the the the game itself so what
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
what's happening on the terminal is a is
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
a um is software that is you know an
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
entertaining uh engagement but the
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
actual wager goes into a totalizer
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
totalizator um and that is where the the
 
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
um the the the system serves up these
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
historic hor races which determine the
 
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
outcome of the game so there that that
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
system takes the wager in calculates the
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
pool because as we're not one of the
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
differentiators between slots and
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing is it is
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
paramutual in nature so when you put a
 
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
dollar into a machine you're you're
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
you're you're betting into a pool um the
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh operator on the the the the revenue
 
00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about gets taken out
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
as a commission or a takeout off the top
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
um and the remainder of that money goes
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
into a pool the totalizer then
 
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919 align:start position:0%
totalizator then manages that pool
 
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
determines an outcome makes a
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
calculation of what the payment should
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
be um and sends that back to the machine
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
so um the you know the tote service
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
which as Mr glum said there are two
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
major ones and there's four total that
 
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
operate in the state that's really the
 
00:33:25.389 --> 00:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
guts of the game um those are the
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
systems that really op at the game um
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
and the the the boxes and the game
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
software that sit on top of that um are
 
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
really more for uh entertainment and
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
engagement with the player but the toad
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
is what really operates the the the the
 
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
HHR so is the pool is the pool just that
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
facilities pool or is it a larger pool
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
than that no the pool is that facility
 
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
and there are pool there are games that
 
00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
um that that pay into a uh into a pool
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
there has to be at least two um there's
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
usually more than two um our rules don't
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
forbid a sharing of pools across um
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
facilities but no one has uh has taken
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
us up on doing that as of yet is that
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
something we should discuss down the
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
road uh about you
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
know would you think we should I mean
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
right now it's not an issue because no
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
one's doing that but it sounds like
 
00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:22.839 align:start position:0%
something we should discuss as a as a
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
group it it's certainly uh something
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
that the commission might be interested
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
in looking at it's it's from a
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
accounting perspective it's actually not
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
um terribly difficult because of the
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
nature of the takeout so if you're
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
sitting in Manchester and you you bet a
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
dollar that dollar that 10 cents is
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
getting taken out in Manchester um and
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
that 90 cents could go into a pool but
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of the accounting that the
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
division is concerned about with respect
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
to making sure the charity gets their
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
cut the state gets their cut in
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester because that's tied to a
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
specific charity that's taken care of
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
before we start going into the pools now
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
our accounting folks would look into
 
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
making sure the Shar pools are paying
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
out correctly but it's not it's not
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
something we're overly concerned about
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
from the lottery perspective at this
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
point in time and again right now The
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
Operators have just not um not sought
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
that but I think that's not necessarily
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
a concern that we have but so what
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying is the operators aren't
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
asking for this either not as of yet
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard that there might be some
 
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
interest in it in the long term but not
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh currently I remember years ago we we
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
dealt with this with Bingo right didn't
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
we do some kind of shared Bingo thing I
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
don't think it really ever took off even
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
though we passed the legislation for it
 
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean certainly I think most of
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
the folks in I could be wrong but I
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
think most of the operators are still
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
trying to get their feet wet trying to
 
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
get their feet under them operate right
 
00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:51.079 align:start position:0%
create a player base Etc so okay I think
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
they're not worried about the next step
 
00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
and that could be I would Mr goes would
 
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.790 align:start position:0%
and that could be I would Mr goes would
probably

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.430 align:start position:0%
probably
be

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
yeah I I just wanted to clarify I don't
 
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
think Mr conord is talking about sharing
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
amongst different operators it's if the
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
same operator owns multiple rooms so
 
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
there's no advantage to the operator it
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
would really be to the I guess marketing
 
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
your bigger jackpots the more people
 
00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
that you have come in the only
 
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
disadvantage of the player you may see a
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
pool go down and it's not at your
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
location so it's somewhere else but it's
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
from operator perspective it we don't
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
gain or lose any more or less Senator l
 
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
so again currently they could do that if
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
they want to we regul there's no
 
00:36:29.069 --> 00:36:29.079 align:start position:0%
legislative action that would need to
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
have to take effect the regulations
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
would allow it right now so so they
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
could if they wanted to for player
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
purposes have larger pools they could
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
combine and do that work if they wanted
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
them yes and it doesn't affect the
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
outcome of the state at all because we
 
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
take our 10% off the top before any any
 
00:36:46.309 --> 00:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
player sees a dollar correct there'd be
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
no impact to the state or the charity
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
and last question just to make sure
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
clear when we talk about class three
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
machines and Slots those are the same
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
things right so again class three
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
machine the slot machine has no
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
technical end on it if you will that
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
database and expense to the operator
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
whereas historic horse racing does have
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
a technical expenditure to the operator
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain them I mean there's
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
still expenses to a class three machine
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
there's still a license fee there's
 
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
still the technical but you're playing
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
against the machine itself whereas
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
historic or raising you're playing
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
against the pool thank you right okay oh
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative hes yeah
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
so you got a hand and you've got a
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
takeout which is also called a
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
commission in our
 
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
statute um in our
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
statute the uh takeout slash commission
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
is up to
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
12% in fact according to this um it's
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
playing it's it's coming out at at about
 
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
9% um how is that engineered what you
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
know the amount of the T of the takeout
 
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
is less than what's Allowed by the
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
statute um both why and how I guess yeah
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
so first of all that 12% is a maximum so
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
there're certainly a permitted to go
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
under that um and so each uh game has a
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
math model associated with it which has
 
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
a takeout percentage and that's how they
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
structure the prizes knowing how much
 
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
money is going to be going into the pool
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
um so they do vary um between as low as
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
six and change up to 11 um and again
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's really all dependent on the math
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
model that's provided to us um we review
 
00:38:38.589 --> 00:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
that just to ensure that it is compliant
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
with the um with the regulation um that
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go over the 12% um and but
 
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
everyone's math model is a little bit
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
different and obviously The Operators
 
00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
pick out the ones that perform the best
 
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
for them um and we have tracked at about
 
00:38:58.109 --> 00:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
nine and change for the the last say
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
four to six months I think that seems to
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
be the Sweet Spot of where operators uh
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
want to be and again that's that's in
 
00:39:09.069 --> 00:39:09.079 align:start position:0%
aggregate individual games vary between
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
like I said that six and change and 1011
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
um we don't we haven't seen I don't
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
think anything as close to 12 on a
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
regular basis follow follow um have you
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
information about other states that have
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
historic horation I know there AR very
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
many but and how the uh the
 
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
takeout compares to
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
our relatively limited experience so
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
representive I would say it's it's
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
anecdotal but we do look at Wyoming and
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
and um I don't know that we've looked at
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
Virginia recently but I believe that the
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
101% is traditional in the other states
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
that we've seen so it's it's it's fairly
 
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
consistent uh with what we've seen in
 
00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.910 align:start position:0%
consistent uh with what we've seen in
New

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you okay all right
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
anything else on this for now just also
 
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
to add to what um John has said all the
 
00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
machines all their math models are
 
00:40:10.349 --> 00:40:10.359 align:start position:0%
tested by a laboratory and that
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
paperwork is submitted here before there
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
was things are allowed in the state so
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
um it's confirmed okay and you do mon
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
you do Mo obviously you're monitoring
 
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.510 align:start position:0%
you do Mo obviously you're monitoring
the

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
percentages yes we we we literally get a
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
uh report from each to for each location
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
every day um and so our Auditors review
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
that every single day U make sure that
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
there's no um um issues that come up for
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
example we we we had a machine that was
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
misprogrammed and went at 12.5% we were
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
able to identify that immediately get
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
that rectified um so that can happen if
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
a software gets loaded in properly or
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
something like that because these games
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
will be have different math models they
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
could be they could be done under
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
different math models models um but we
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
do review those literally daily right
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay J again thank you so just to follow
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
up to that so I understand the 12% limit
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
so if and because it's a game of chance
 
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
if somehow even with the math model
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
there was an aberration and it hits
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
let's say 133% does that extra 1% just
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
or or then the the operator would have
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
to just adjust back down to 12% it it
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
should never be it's because it's not uh
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
this isn't a payout like it would be on
 
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
a on a slot machine it's a set takeout
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's always there it should be
 
00:41:38.349 --> 00:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
programmed in correctly so it it within
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
each game it should always be what it's
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
what it was tested at and what it was uh
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
designed to be um so we don't get we may
 
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
get variance in wins or losses so the
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
pool may go up or they may go down
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
within a day but that takeout percentage
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
should not
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
change okay I see no other hands so
 
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
let's move on to the next agenda item um
 
00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
there'll be more discussion about all of
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
this I'm as we move forward but um the
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
uh the uh list of Charities and the
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
money they made it was asked that we see
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
all the Charities uh that are involved
 
00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
right now and a sense of the money that
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
was made so we have two sets of charts
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
us and they were by quarter looks like
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
they were by quarter oh no by
 
00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:36.990 align:start position:0%
they were by quarter oh no by
month

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
or some and then another set of were by
 
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.750 align:start position:0%
or some and then another set of were by
by

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
this there's one that has the Bingo and
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
Lucky Seven on it as
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
well and then there's charts that
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
yeah eron did you get this one's yours
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
from from The Operators group did you
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
provide this no we we didn't provide any
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
of sen we provided that okay I'm sorry
 
00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:11.559 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry this that's and this is the
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
charity allocation is HHR and on on this
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
one that has the uh allocation the rent
 
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
allocation that's the gross of HHR end
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
um or is that just games a
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
chance I I think it depends on the
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
facility no I think Senator it's just
 
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
schemes of chance for the for the
 
00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:33.559 align:start position:0%
quarter Le that we provided to you of
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
course rent isn't taken to maor char
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's right yeah right that's that's
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
the question I had too once we get going
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
so uh is this just for our information
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
is someone want to discuss what's I
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
think it was informational I think there
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
was a question by a number of the
 
00:43:53.069 --> 00:43:53.079 align:start position:0%
members to the variance between um which
 
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
facilities charge which levels of rent
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
some but there's no set
 
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
amount right other than it has to be a
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable rent for a
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
property of that size in that given
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction I'm going to talk about
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
this in a minute I I have another hand
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
out myself that I did up over the
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
weekend so okay so this is just FYI the
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
the first set is in looks like alphab
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
alphabetical order of the Charities that
 
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:20.990 align:start position:0%
alphabetical order of the Charities that
are

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
involved and it's just um just
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
the right it's just the table games not
 
00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.470 align:start position:0%
the right it's just the table games not
HHR

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
HHR
 
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
correct this
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
one H that does have HHR too yeah so it
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
just shows this is all this is all the
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
revenue how it's broken okay and then
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
and then what the rent is but the rent
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
is is against just the games of
 
00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:52.839 align:start position:0%
chance yes that's correct okay and then
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
the second set is uh is uh the four
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
quarters here uh that are shown
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
um and that that's again I want to make
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
sure that's when we say charity
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
allocation that's just from
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
the is that just from H from games of
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
chance I don't I have a feeling it's
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
both but though Mr chair I think the the
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
ones that are La labeled as quarterly um
 
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
right their charity quarterly charity
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
allocation and Rental payments yes so
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
there are four of those for um those are
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
for games of chance
 
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
alone um and then the obviously the
 
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
larger spreadsheet that is by month is
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
for all all Gaming revenue for by
 
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.470 align:start position:0%
for all all Gaming revenue for by
charity

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
charity
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
okay all right so I spend a little time
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
on this over the weekend which is a
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
dangerous thing um can you help me out
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
I'm want to hand these
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:02.950 align:start position:0%
I'm want to hand these
out

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
too so as I was saying that the main U
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
thing I want to cover today is is the uh
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
is the rent
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
payments and um
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
so first thing we we'll we'll start with
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
the top thing on this handout is the uh
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
is the actual
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
statute uh 287d colon9 facilities
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
rental the top part uh Roman Roman
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
one really is is for if you want to
 
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
uh not go one of these f locations but
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
want to have this has nothing to do with
 
00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.559 align:start position:0%
the teral gaming locations we're talking
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
about is my understanding so it's it's
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
really Roman 2 that we're talking
 
00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.390 align:start position:0%
really Roman 2 that we're talking
about

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
and uh it says uh first says if a
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
charitable organization contracts for
 
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
services from a game operator employer
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
license under RSA 287 d8 the game
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
operator employer shall provide
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
equipment and shall not charge the
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
charitable organization for such
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
equipment okay cuz that's that's pretty
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
and I think they we're okay with that
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
that part of it then then it goes on to
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
say no charitable organ organization
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
shall receive less than 35% of the gross
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
revenues from any game of chance minus
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
any prizes paid and Rental charge under
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
of under the uh sub paragraph uh sub
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph B which is the next
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph and I think
 
00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.430 align:start position:0%
paragraph and I think
uh

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
it it that appears to be what's going on
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
it's 35% is what's coming up these are
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
these are the games of uh games of
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
chance but then
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
B is if a gamer operative employee
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
charges rent son's charge shall be
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
written be by written agreement and
 
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
shall be fixed
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
payment not based on percentage of what
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
the charal organization receives from
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
the game a
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
chance uh and here's where I start
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
getting a little nervous
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
because uh I don't know if there's
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
really written
 
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
agreements um and I've spoken to two
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
Charities that claim that there's no no
 
00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:42.230 align:start position:0%
Charities that claim that there's no no
written

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
agreements uh I had one that told me
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
that that boy we used to pay you know
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
$50 in random uh a day and now we're
 
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
paying you know $750 a day with no no
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
interaction and I had another charity
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
who said and they brought their contract
 
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
their agreement and I there was nothing
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
about renting it so uh but then it says
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
later on it says
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
agreement shall reflect the fair market
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
then it says it shall reflect the fair
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
market value of the property for
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
use and that's a tough one I mean how do
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
we how do we how do we figure that out a
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
fair market value of the the rent now
 
00:49:33.789 --> 00:49:33.799 align:start position:0%
now this all this statute it's all
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
before HHR machines so these table games
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
are in the same buildings as the HHR
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
machines matter of fact there's more
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
floor space that's HR machines then than
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
games a
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
chance uh then you go to C any service
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
or rental agreement entered into by the
 
00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:52.799 align:start position:0%
charel organization shall be submitted
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
with the charel organization's license
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
after application for review by The
 
00:49:57.119 --> 00:49:59.069 align:start position:0%
after application for review by The
Lottery

00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
Lottery
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
Commission so the question becomes is
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
that really what
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
happens uh yes Mr chair it is um the
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
every charity has to have for games of
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
chance has to have a uh written contract
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
agreement we have a form agreement uh
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
that does absolutely address rent um and
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
goes on file and is reviewed and a
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
charity would not get licensed without
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
having one of those on file with the
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
commission so if a charity is indicating
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
that they have not signed an agreement
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how that would have gone
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
through our process I'm asking the
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
question yep um so I'm right so so in
 
00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:40.990 align:start position:0%
question yep um so I'm right so so in
that

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
agreement there's a fixed amount that's
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
agreed to there is a fixed amount that
 
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
is agreed to so the the form the form
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
agreement that the commission provides
 
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
has a blank space for the rent number so
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
that a a charity and room are free to
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
negotiate a rent uh number that is uh
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
obviously within the fair market value
 
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
um but they have to identify that number
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
for the commission so if you um any
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
charity that we have we would have an
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
agreement on file which would indicate
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
what the what the charity uh rent will
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
be okay so and and and this would be
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
signed by both the the the Char location
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
as well as the charity correct okay so I
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
will I'll go
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
back so to be clear when we talk about
 
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
fair market value we're talking about at
 
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
5,000 square feet of space What would I
 
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
be able to get if say I was hosting a
 
00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
wedding for that night or something
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
other event and what would the nightly
 
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
cost be for that and then you establish
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
what that what that is for that area and
 
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
they can't exceed that number so Senator
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's what how we've interpreted it
 
00:51:56.349 --> 00:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
obviously the language is uh doesn't is
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
not that specific but when we did an
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
analysis on fair market value um the
 
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
most analogous thing that we could see
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
was renting of event space for meetings
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
weddings parties th that that type of
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
event um and so we did an analysis by uh
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
by uh area of the state on what a fair
 
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
market value on event space would be and
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
obviously anyone who's ever had to uh
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
pay for a wedding knows um that can be
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
quite costly alth you phone and if if
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
the form that you talked about that is
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
provided by the CH by The Lottery
 
00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:33.799 align:start position:0%
Commission to the uh charity has a
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
number that would exceed that fair
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
market value you wouldn't allow that to
 
00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:41.240 align:start position:0%
go through we would not thank you
 
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.829 align:start position:0%
go through we would not thank you
okay

00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
so uh it' be helpful um if you can just
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
is it public can you share some of those
 
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
agreements with
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
us absolutely we can share that okay
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
just want to see that I I okay I'd
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that so okay
 
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
yes I think one of the items again here
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
that there are contracts obviously
 
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:09.559 align:start position:0%
between the operator and the charity and
 
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
the charity is
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
basically you know again lack of a
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
better word here if you want this hell
 
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
hostage because basically goes over and
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
says okay here it is it's a you know get
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
$750 or $1,000 if you want a
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
day negotiations are very limited
 
00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
because the operator can just say hey
 
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
this is what it is right and we're just
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
going to have another charity come in
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
for your for your 10 days so that it's
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
right this is what we're trying to
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
understand we're trying to understand
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
this is just historic you know actually
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
as I was going through numbers and I'm a
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
numbers guy and I cut I really start to
 
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
understand when when this all started
 
00:53:50.589 --> 00:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
all these facilities were small weren't
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
really big places and we understood
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
there would needed to be protections
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
that the so that the the facilities
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't lose money I understand that
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
now but but what you're going to see in
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
a minute is the sizes are way there's
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
still some small ones but there's a
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
bunch of big ones too and those in the
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
middle so I I I think this part of the
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
statute needs to be really worked on I I
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
I was on w means for 12 years I never
 
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
really I always heard charity but never
 
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:21.640 align:start position:0%
really investigated what what that was
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
and I always thought it was like a flat
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
number that everybody PID
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
but no it's up to the individual instit
 
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh location to choose what they think is
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
fair uh but then is that fair to the
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
charity I don't know that's something
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to address but uh
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
what I did over the weekend if you go to
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
the scribbling the next two pages I took
 
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
the I took the numbers from
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I took the numbers from the
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
um the quarterly reports and I tried to
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
group them under the each each charity
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
and I did one more thing if because if
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
you go to that and I lost where's my
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
these so you'll see in the F if you take
 
00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
a look at these guys these these charts
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
here uh you'll see in parentheses the
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
number of days that they're open okay
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
because I wanted to really see what the
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
rent was by facility per day per day
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
meaning the day that that they're
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
open and that the charity is sponsoring
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
so I had I went through the numbers and
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
see the uh column to the it's little
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
hard to read because I was doing this
 
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
quick charity charity days and then rent
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
per day and the uh the rent per day is
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
based on the rent the rent
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
column so you'll see like Casablanca
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region they're small they they're
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
probably 12th out of the 13 that we had
 
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
data for in terms of size based on only
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.630 align:start position:0%
 
269,000

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
269,000
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
$500 in rent or 42% rent if you go
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
through these you're going to see the
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
rents ranging from 5% all the way to
 
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
50% okay that's number one all over the
 
00:56:39.549 --> 00:56:39.559 align:start position:0%
place but actually I've come to
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
understand when you see this other chart
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
that I have that maybe the smaller
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
places actually had to charge more
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
because that because of their
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
size uh and to hold these events and all
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
that but we we'll talk more about that
 
00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
but then I wanted to see because I'm
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
looking from the CH charitable
 
00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
organizations uh charal organizations
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
perspective as well as the uh facility
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh game operators
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
perspective so so it looks like I'm not
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
picking on Casablanca here I'm just
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
saying that they looks like they charge
 
00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.950 align:start position:0%
saying that they looks like they charge
around

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
475 a day then you go down to wonder
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
casino and they're like middle of the
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
pack about eight one Wonder Casino uh
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
which is also in
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
conquer um it looks like before this is
 
00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.390 align:start position:0%
conquer um it looks like before this is
where

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh here here's here's a phenomenon you
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
could tell from the days 92 days one
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
quarter 60 days another then 155 and
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
then 175 in the last two
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
quarters that tells me that uh and those
 
00:57:52.349 --> 00:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
days included two
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
Charities so we have now we have two
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
char Charities paying rent for the same
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
facility which is another issue even
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
though even though there HHR machines
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
are not included in the
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
numbers uh but it looks like uh those
 
00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
facilities that have char historic
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
racing there's two Charities not one and
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
you can see from these
 
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
numbers it looks like somewhere halfway
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
through they were they just had
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
um uh jamic chance but then they they uh
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
they they
 
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
had uh uh historic racing as well
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
because it was well
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
above uh the number of days in a quarter
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
that would be just one one
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
charity so but then what happened there
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
was then they then they they didn't
 
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
change the rate per but there's two but
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
they're getting uh uh well they did they
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
actually reduced they cut cut it in half
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
basically so that's fine if you go to
 
00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
Dover Poker Room uh they're at
 
00:59:06.029 --> 00:59:06.039 align:start position:0%
38% and then they were they were
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
charging 250 a day but when they got
 
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines that that went
 
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
up to like 750 a day I don't know
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
why uh then I have Boston Billiards they
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
were around 500 a day and then it
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
dropped down to 250 a day okay maybe
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
recog that there were two now because
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
you could tell that there's now historic
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
racing there now from these numbers if
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
you keep on going down the list you can
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
see um um the Granite State Poker
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
Alliance which is in Manchester they
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
were charging around 500 a day and now
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
they're charging 750 a day but times
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
two so uh then you have smaller rooms
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
like um well no the interesting one is
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
is chases which is one of the biggest so
 
00:59:57.029 --> 00:59:57.039 align:start position:0%
the second amount of revenue of any of
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
them and they didn't change it they have
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have historic racing machines
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
they're at basically 90 days a quarter
 
01:00:05.549 --> 01:00:05.559 align:start position:0%
and it's about
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
$500 across the board but the
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
the uh then you go down to Lebanon poker
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
room um again they have they looks like
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
they picked up historic racing machines
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
about halfway through this this this
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal year uh and the rent went down uh
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
from 250 to 125 you can see it's all
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
over the place per from the from the
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
Chari perspective how much are they uh
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
per day are they taking in being rent uh
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
having to pay
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
rent uh and I can keep on going through
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
these but the smallest room the
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
interesting thing is that the smallest
 
01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
room which is Northwoods
 
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
Casino has the has the lowest rent they
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
don't have historic racing machines
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
they're charging 14 47 on the average
 
01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
probably 150 is their target but
 
01:00:58.599 --> 01:00:59.510 align:start position:0%
probably 150 is their target but
whatever

01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
reason but when you put the charity days
 
01:01:05.549 --> 01:01:05.559 align:start position:0%
against the rent it really starts
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
showing you what we're what we're
 
01:01:10.349 --> 01:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with so if you flip to the next
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
page I summarized this for you I went
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
from the I took the annual dollar
 
01:01:16.079 --> 01:01:17.789 align:start position:0%
from the I took the annual dollar
charity

01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
charity
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
allocation and they're ranked in terms
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
of that from top to bottom so the brook
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
has 3.7 Mill do in charity
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
allocation uh big time money all the way
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
to North uh Northwoods Casino which is
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
106 729
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
176,000 and then I have what the rent is
 
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
and I have the
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
percent uh of the allocation and you can
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
see the bigger places have a smaller
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
allocation 7% 5% 5% fortimo is 14% and
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
then the the conquer Casino has the
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
highest of
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
50% um but when you so that's looking at
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
it from the
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
uh um from the facility standpoint but
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
from the from the charity standpoint the
 
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
last column is what is actually being
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
subtracted from their allocation per day
 
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
ranges from
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
$147 a day Northwood casino but I just
 
01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:24.870 align:start position:0%
$147 a day Northwood casino but I just
me

01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned up to filamin Phil filimo up
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
to 671 a
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
day uh there's no consistency here um at
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
all and I think this is one of the
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
reasons that we need to uh spend some
 
01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:42.039 align:start position:0%
more time on this and then on the bottom
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
I put a little thing that's saying that
 
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
if I put a little a next to it it
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
appears that there um they're still just
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
table games only a b means in
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
parenthesis means that's the table games
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
plus HHR happen somewhere in
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
there uh well like the only one that's
 
01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:04.839 align:start position:0%
that's a b is is the brook they've had
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
it from the numbers it looks like
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
they've had it the whole year and then
 
01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:10.839 align:start position:0%
anybody who's a c basically it looked
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
like somewhere halfway through the year
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
they put the historic racing machines in
 
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
so which means that there's two
 
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
Charities that are paying the rent now
 
01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm pointing these things out as as
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
discussion points for us as we go on
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
then I then I charted it it's always
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
good to see a
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
picture if you go to the last two pages
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
the one you you could see you could see
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
the the uh annual allocation as against
 
01:03:38.799 --> 01:03:39.470 align:start position:0%
the the uh annual allocation as against
the

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
rent and you can see uh the highest is
 
01:03:47.069 --> 01:03:47.079 align:start position:0%
is conquer
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
casino and the least is um Boston bards
 
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
and some of the others there uh grouped
 
01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
if I took the if I took the top four
 
01:03:59.309 --> 01:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
number out it's pretty much a straight
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
line in terms of percent from the size
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh but we looks but it looks like it's
 
01:04:08.269 --> 01:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
kind of an exponential kind of a thing
 
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
going down um from there but when you
 
01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
look at the last chart which is rent per
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
charity day versus charity
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
allocation there's really no rhyme to
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
reason um it looks like it's just
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
scattered everywhere uh so I guess what
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
with that basically the numbers are
 
01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839 align:start position:0%
showing me
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
that uh if we if we keep rent we need to
 
01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:35.799 align:start position:0%
do some work about how do
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
we um how do we do this and there
 
01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
there's some activity in the house
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
looking to do away with
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
rent um we'll see where that goes U when
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
the session happens next beginning of
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
January retain
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
bill um but I want to open this up to
 
01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
discussion I I I I think that U Senator
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
Lang no again I'm just a little I'm
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
trying to look at your
 
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
number the two things that strike me is
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
number one location location location
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
right so a cost of a room in Nashville
 
01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:09.799 align:start position:0%
is going to be different than a cost of
 
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
a room in Belmont because again what the
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
average fair market value is for a given
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
room is going to be adjusted and changed
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
size Matters right so again depending on
 
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
the size of facility the amount of rent
 
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
you charge for the size of the facility
 
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:23.480 align:start position:0%
is going to make a difference I'm not
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
sure how we know aliz that data into
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
what is a fair market value estimate um
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
somehow Lottery is able to do that um
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
obviously if I only have a 2,000 foot
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
room versus a 5,000 foot room I'm going
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
to get a different rent and but the rent
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
should still be the same per day for a
 
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
given facility anyway may not be between
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
the facility in Belmont and the facility
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
in NASA but the rent is still all of the
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
rent charged in NASA is going to be a
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
same amount per charity assuming they
 
01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
have a fixed contract I don't know we
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
talk to the operators and see if they
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
negotiate different for different
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
charities or every charity pays the same
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
amount but again I'm not sure how you
 
01:06:02.029 --> 01:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
normalize that when you're dealing with
 
01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
location and you're dealing with size um
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
amenities what you offer and what you
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't offer is free Wi-Fi no free Wi-Fi
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
what is included in that rental charge
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
that they have access to so I don't know
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
how you would normalize that data other
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
than what Lottery's already doing by
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
saying a 500 foot facility in nashille
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
is worth a th000 bucks a day well from
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
the can't exceed that number from the
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
first chart it looks like it's it's
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
happening by itself that that yes the
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
bigger places and these are the big the
 
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
three down that the right hand corner
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
there that are in the 3.5 million
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
range have have a have the smallest
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
percent of the allocation going to them
 
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
from a from a facility location it
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're the lowest
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
rent though because when you go to the
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
the last chart that isn't the case
 
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
they're more in the middle uh are the
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
high end of the middle so the question
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
becomes well why is that
 
01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
why do they even need if you're a big
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
facility and if we're comparing
 
01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:04.390 align:start position:0%
facility and if we're comparing
ourselves

01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
to let's call them Vegas Times casinos
 
01:07:11.269 --> 01:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as rent uh do we
 
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
really need rent uh is the bigger
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
picture question uh I think it's one we
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
have to address and I I tried to put
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
some more data around this to to to show
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
it and to show and then the other thing
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
is that with the historic racing one
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
thing I didn't know going into this
 
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
meeting was whether in the in the
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
allocation whether the historic racing
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh money was in there as well and it
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
sounds like it isn't so uh but these
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
places once were getting one rent now
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
they're getting two rents for the same
 
01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
facility so that's something we have to
 
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
address uh because the statute hasn't
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
changed since the you know about eight
 
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
nine eight years
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
ago um where historic racing machines
 
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.190 align:start position:0%
ago um where historic racing machines
didn't

01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
exist um so I I just think of is
 
01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:03.799 align:start position:0%
something we have to have to deal with
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
as a as a commission on this on this
 
01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
topic so is anybody else want to discuss
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
it nope
 
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
okay how do the charity Representatives
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
this um so I also work at Boston buer
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
club now Gates City casino and I'm on a
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
couple boards as well so the way we I
 
01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
can only speak to that one location we
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
used to when we did games a chance
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
charge a flat rate of 500 per day that
 
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
fell in the percentage we're obviously
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
large we have larger
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
expenses when we ended up having two
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
Charities benefit we split that fee
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
between the two with the tiered system
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
if you're a tier one which all it means
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
you're a charity that benefited in
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
2020 if you're paired with the tier two
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
the tier one gets preference per the
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
legislation they get 100% of games a
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
chance and half of HHR so if you're
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
paired with a tier 2 they would pay that
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
whole 500 where the tier 2 only
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
benefiting from HHR wouldn't pay
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
anything if you have the same tiers the
 
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
we try to pair the same tiers together
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
just so it's fair but that's just that's
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
our location if you pair the same tear
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
together they split it so they each paid
 
01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
the 250 so rather than doubling the rent
 
01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
we just split it in
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
half okay yeah so but I'm not sure of if
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
is everybody else doing it the same way
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
you're doing it see what I mean it seems
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
like I understand I would I would have a
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
sense that
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's we've left it up to the facilities
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
to make the rules if they the road if
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
you will I'm I'm sure it varies just
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
because it's just structured that you
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
can I mean certainly As I understood the
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
basis for rent it was what a time when
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
the operators were struggling right and
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
now the current run rate for St horse
 
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
racing is to exceed $100 million in
 
01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue so rent doesn't seem like it's
 
01:10:07.719 --> 01:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
Revenue so rent doesn't seem like it's
needed

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
anymore so I mean let's use Boston
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
billage you say that's where you your
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
Boston billage so the so the allocation
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
to charity 3.5 million doesn't include
 
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
the HH HHR
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
money um
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
and so that's 35%
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
so I mean the other 65% it makes it you
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
know it's you know over10
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
million so this is a big business this
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
is not this is not um I might be
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting but I thought this did
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
Charlie could speak to it maybe I
 
01:10:44.669 --> 01:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
thought it did include
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
HHR no which there's two of them there's
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
two charts this one doesn't this came
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
off the quarterly
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
vertical apologize pulled off these I
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
pulled these and and handwritten off of
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
the the quarterly reports yeah okay
 
01:11:02.669 --> 01:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
because that's the only place that had
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
the number in parentheses it had the
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
days each of the
 
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.830 align:start position:0%
days each of the
Charities

01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
Charities
 
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
participated okay and then once the
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
Charities once those days went over 365
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
I knew that there was historic racing
 
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line um because
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's how many days there are so
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh fun question yeah can I'm sorry I'm
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
going to apologize here I'm going to go
 
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
backwards a little bit tier one versus
 
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
tier two so Charlie can you describe
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
that for us so way every understands of
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
course so with the Advent of store horse
 
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.189 align:start position:0%
course so with the Advent of store horse
racing

01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
racing
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
um it would take a while to get up and
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
running and so when the facility did
 
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
indeed start doing historic horse racing
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
they would have to have now two
 
01:11:49.629 --> 01:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
Charities but um it was impressed upon
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
us that we didn't want the Legacy
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
Charities which would be the tier ones
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
which had been in child gambling prior
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
to HHR to lose out essentially and so
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
that there would be a phased in process
 
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
by where we'd have two tiers tier one is
 
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
the Legacy Charities would have the
 
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
80% PR 2020 any charity prior to 2020
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
let me the numbers no the tier ones um
 
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
would get all of uh I believe all of
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
games and chance and half of HHR and
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
then the tier 2 would only participate
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
in HHR the thinking being obviously that
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
tier tws that would be all new money for
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
those Charities um so while it would be
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
an uneven split um the tier two
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
Charities would uh be new participants
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
in and obviously it be new money to the
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
charity and that runs through I believe
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
January this year yeah so so in January
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
this year you will you may have Legacy
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
Charities which now have to split evenly
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
with another charity and they their
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
money will may go down but may go up it
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
certainly with the it just depend on the
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
room and and the facility yeah but to
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
G's point I think I know she speaking
 
01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
only as to Gate City um but I think our
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
experience now is that most operators uh
 
01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
pair like siiz tiers together uh ones
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
and ones and twos and twos so that it is
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
an even split uh more often than not
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
just confirming that yes that is correct
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
um so um although they had the ability
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
to sort of um grandfather in the older
 
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
Charities what has happened is that
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
they've um I think probably to to manage
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
Charities um they're they're tearing
 
01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
them together so they're each getting
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
the same check um so although we had
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
that system in place it's it's the
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
operators have have sort of decided to
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
to to move forward and from what I
 
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
understand um because there's been
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
substantial growth in HHR and then
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
there's been growth in in games of
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
chance as well because of the $50 bet um
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that Charities are are
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
making the same as they did uh before
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
but it's probably relatively close and
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
obviously The Operators would have a
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
better sense of
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
that thank you so I'm just trying to
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
understand be clear so tier one tier the
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
tiers are going away essentially as of
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
January one of this year of 23 or as of
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
24 so January 1 the tiers go away and at
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
that point all if you have two Charities
 
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
involved they'll get they just split all
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
the Gaming revenue for a given day
 
01:14:25.149 --> 01:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
50/50 yes that is correct thank
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
you so our numbers our our our metrics
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
are going to shift potentially that
 
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
we're looking at now because we're
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
looking at data that doesn't isn't
 
01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
allocated that way for
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
Charities so so Senator Lang potentially
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a data shift but
 
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
more likely it's going to be a very
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
minor data shift because as I was saying
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
the game operators are essentially
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
operating as they would have to do after
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
January 1 anyway they are putting the
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
same tiers together which means a 50/50
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
split so I think we're living in a world
 
01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:57.709 align:start position:0%
split so I think we're living in a world
where

01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
essentially we have 50-50 split of
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
Charities regardless thank you Aaron I
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
want you to chime in Aon what's your
 
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
facility again uh so we have Dover uh
 
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
Manch currently operating Dover
 
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester Lebanon um Keane as well as
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
Northwoods right which one is Kean Keane
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
is Wonder Casino Wonder okay
 
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
right so you you have facilities of all
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
sizes here correct I mean okay
 
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
so yeah again my thinking is that you
 
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
know historically we we protected this
 
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
because they all started as small when
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
this all
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
started and we protected them and maybe
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
there was a reason for that and I I
 
01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
could actually understand that um you
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
know I look at Northwoods and I you know
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
which which one is your smallest one
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
Lebanon uh Lebanon probably leanon with
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
HHR yeah and the and the Lebanon Lebanon
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh you
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
know I'm trying to get a sense of if we
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
did away with
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
warrant again I'm a little concerned
 
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
about the smaller places that they may
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
need some up protection a little bit if
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
if they they're open they open their
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
thing but no one shows up or it's it's
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
bad and they have the
 
01:16:25.149 --> 01:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
expense uh but the larger places I don't
 
01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
think that's going to happen um and that
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
if we if we modified the
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
rent um this wouldn't be a big an issue
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
just I need I need an
 
01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
operator's perception look I could talk
 
01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
specifically about us but I'm here on
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
behalf of the operators but if you look
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
at what we're paying on rent we own
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
currently the property under one of our
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
locations the rest we rent all the rent
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
we collect is less and we pay in actual
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
rent for the space um so it it's not I
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
mean it is that there's a market value
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's probably as close as you're going
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
to get to that and that doesn't include
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
the investment that that we have put
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
properties but you're also making money
 
01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
on the correct on the on the correct
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
play I mean isn't like it's all supposed
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
to go correct yeah thanks Mr chair I and
 
01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
I think the testimony we've heard in
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard over the years was
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
the survivability of the model initially
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh survivability of The Operators and
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
the Charities themselves back in the day
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
of two and four bets I think we've we've
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
uh grown far from that and um and I
 
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
think it's something dime to Donuts we
 
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
need to uh to look at and and and
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
dismiss I actually have uh an amendment
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
that Ways and Means is going to hear on
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
Wednesday day that addresses this it
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
eliminates there's some cleanup language
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
I have to do to the amendment so we hit
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
every paragraph in
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
287 uh and to back that up I have
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
another LSR in place I think we've we've
 
01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
far grown past the point where we need
 
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
to be having the Charities pay a rent
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
for a space that is profitable for all
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
involved uh it's not about the
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
survivability of the the model anymore
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
so again all these facilities aren't
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
equal they are big big and they're small
 
01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
small I mean and that's what we're
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
talking about so we got to be careful
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
how we handle us if I could sort of when
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
you characterize big big I think
 
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
Foxwoods and so you sort of if you look
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
in the sphere yes there's a facility
 
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
that's the largest in the state and then
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
there's the smallest in the state right
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
but as I've said before all of them told
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
together don't equal twin members so
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
just sort of for the record I I worry
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
adjectives which are sort of I don't
 
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
want to say inflammatory but certainly
 
01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.189 align:start position:0%
want to say inflammatory but certainly
no

01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
no headline driven thank you for that of
 
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
course so again it ranges from 106,000
 
01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
to the Charities to 3.7 million to the
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
Charities uh you know even even within
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
this range of size facility perhaps one
 
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
size doesn't fit all is what I'm getting
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
at so um but it sounds like the legisl
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
is already looking at this uh so we'll
 
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
dis monitor that but um
 
01:19:29.229 --> 01:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
again this is your data was very helpful
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
to me to to extract which this to to get
 
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
a sense of what what the actual rents
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
are and again I find very interesting
 
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
that this the one off with the lowest
 
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
rent per the charity is $147 was the
 
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
smallest facility so somehow they're
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
surviving and now it could be that it's
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
I'd say we're barely surviving until we
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
move the location so oh is that one
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
worse that's Lebanon is where we're move
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
we're moving to a new spot okay
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
so all right all right any other
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
discussion on this topic all
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
um okay the next item is funding of
 
01:20:24.590 --> 01:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
communities with charitable ation U with
 
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
a chable um that's what the things
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
basically funding
 
01:20:31.149 --> 01:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
communities I I've gotten several calls
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
from communities uh people
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
saying uh why AR why AR the communities
 
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
getting uh some of this um some of the
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
profits if you will of these
 
01:20:49.149 --> 01:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
facilities um we know when we had when
 
01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
we heard years ago um charity uh uh
 
01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
Casino bills you know Vegas style Casino
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
bills uh there was always provision in
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
there that the facilities would get uh
 
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
compensated for the extra police and so
 
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
forth so
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
on uh I don't think it was originally
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
contemplated because these were all
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
small now they're growing into on our
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
world New Hampshire
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
scale uh they're growing um and I I I
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
would imagine this is something that we
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
as a group should be discussing uh
 
01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
Charlie did you you have a com on this
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
your name no it's just as I've said I
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
think if I haven't I apologize um every
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
every town or city we visit it's either
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
the first or second question we get is
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
we're having to host this what what's in
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
it for us and certainly the the fear of
 
01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
sort of additional Services by the city
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
or town that are not compensated right
 
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying anything bad obviously
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
we're all in you know I'm in gambling
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
for a living so um it's not it's just an
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
additional Services may be required in
 
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
Cedar Town and funding for those
 
01:21:57.629 --> 01:21:57.639 align:start position:0%
Services would be very much appreciated
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
by those communities is this um common
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
practice um I mean it seemed like it was
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
this big a point of discussion when we
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
talked about these um you know big Vegas
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
companies cominging in and yeah you know
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
during the original Casino bill that
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative Ames and I worked on a
 
01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
commission back in 15 13 13 um I believe
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
it was the host Community got 3%
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
of the revenues from the facility and
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
then each surrounding Community split 1%
 
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
if I recall correctly I could be wrong
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
on that but I think that's right is so
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
if for the city of say Manchester
 
01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester would get 3% of that
 
01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
facilities revenues in the surrounding
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
communities would split 1% um of that
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
facility's take
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
right my only my only comment there is
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
they are paying property taxes these
 
01:22:53.629 --> 01:22:53.639 align:start position:0%
facilities too to be sure to be sure
 
01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
right and that sort of that number
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
varies by like for example um I know
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
like plane ridge for example is required
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
to do an minimum investment of 100
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
million I think and Encore was 400 or
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
500 million and so it there's very
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
there's vared ways to sort of make the
 
01:23:13.709 --> 01:23:13.719 align:start position:0%
facility be a community partner right in
 
01:23:15.629 --> 01:23:15.639 align:start position:0%
that respect right so it's common
 
01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
practice yeah yeah yeah I mean certainly
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
in the newer facilities yeah ones sort
 
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
of the Vagas that are um
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in from decades ago
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
centuries ago no but now it's common
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
okay so again as as we do our work here
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
um I guess we have to
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
start thinking about whether you know at
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
the end of this process we're going to
 
01:23:40.199 --> 01:23:41.110 align:start position:0%
the end of this process we're going to
have

01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations and we have to and we'll
 
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
be voting on those recommendations okay
 
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
as individual recommendations as we go
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
along so we we need to talk more about
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
that uh if everyone one thinks that this
 
01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
is something that the legislature should
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
take up our report's going to be report
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
of recommendations it's really up to the
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
legislature to take those up if they so
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
choose uh but it's recommendations that
 
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
we think uh you know we're pausing here
 
01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:11.719 align:start position:0%
we have a year to do our work which the
 
01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
legislature doesn't have that kind of
 
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
time and that's why we're paused and
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking at all of this and
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know some of the facilities are
 
01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
getting bigger again on our and then New
 
01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:23.550 align:start position:0%
getting bigger again on our and then New
Hampshire

01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
scale um and and yes they probably are
 
01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:28.430 align:start position:0%
scale um and and yes they probably are
looking

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
step you know when we did Kino Kino
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to do with security but
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
it's has to do with um the town voting
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
to have a facility we did historic
 
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
racing that issue was brought up but I
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
said no no this is adding a game to an
 
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
existing facility
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh but we don't have op an opt-in or an
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
opt out provision for any future
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
facilities I don't think we could adopt
 
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
one for existing facilities or existing
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
facilities so that's going to be another
 
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
topic uh that we have to address uh
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
going forward if something we we want to
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
do for any additional facilities as well
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
as how many facilities um do we think we
 
01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:18.910 align:start position:0%
as how many facilities um do we think we
can

01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
handle uh there might be a diminishing
 
01:25:24.270 --> 01:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
return in terms of um you know there's
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
only certain population that's going to
 
01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:29.719 align:start position:0%
play these games anyway so uh but that's
 
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
another one um but in that bigger
 
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
picture conversation this whole issue of
 
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
supporting the
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
community uh would I think needs to be
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
involved so di yeah um this discussion
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
of funding for communities with
 
01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
locations with game rooms um that have
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh raises the point points to the need
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
um as we have it as well with the
 
01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.830 align:start position:0%
um as we have it as well with the
allocations

01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
allocations
 
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
of of um ultimately the handle uh than
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
the takeout um but particularly the
 
01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
takeout um and whether what we've got in
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
place right now and the statute is right
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
or should be tweaked it points to the
 
01:26:26.109 --> 01:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
all these things point to the need for
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
um good information about what other
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
states are doing that have had different
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
kinds of experiences sometimes in the
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
case of historical horse racing much
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
longer than us ours and I think we can
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
learn a lot uh you mentioned playing
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
field uh Charlie mentioned planfield and
 
01:26:51.070 --> 01:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh that's next door to us um that's
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
relatively new I don't know how many
 
01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
years now five six years something like
 
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:13.629 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
yeah they were yeah yeah okay anyway the
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
point is that there's good information
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
out there uh
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is not New Hampshire uh we
 
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
all know that and so forth Maine is not
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but Maine also has
 
01:27:35.109 --> 01:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
experience that we need to get to inform
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
us as we make judgments for ourselves on
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
how to make an allocation for the
 
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
expenses the communities are incurring
 
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
taking into account the property tax
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
revenues will also be coming in all that
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
kind of thing um the more information we
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
can get get and the more help we can get
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
from this consultant that uh we're going
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
to hire to to do that for us is uh is
 
01:28:03.149 --> 01:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
just welcome and and necessary for us to
 
01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
do a good good
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
job so Charlie again if I could I guess
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
the first question I had is as to a
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
consultant is what do we want well
 
01:28:16.109 --> 01:28:16.119 align:start position:0%
that's an agenda item to talk about yeah
 
01:28:17.229 --> 01:28:17.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you we're getting there
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
it just before you do that so this is
 
01:28:21.070 --> 01:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
another document that was handed out to
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
us and it does you want just going
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
through this with us real quick sure and
 
01:28:28.109 --> 01:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
certainly it's it's a breakdown of
 
01:28:28.119 --> 01:28:30.030 align:start position:0%
certainly it's it's a breakdown of
essentially

01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
All State legislatively authorized
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
gaming specifically machine
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
gaming in New England those facilities
 
01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
where they
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
are and certainly an overview of the
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
activity itself in the state and the
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
numbers involved so that's certainly
 
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
what this is for is last meeting I
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
suggested I think I was asked or i'
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
offered to do a breakdown of the numbers
 
01:28:59.550 --> 01:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
of other Estates and what their Gaming
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
revenue looks like and so that's what
 
01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
um most notably Connecticut is not on
 
01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:07.719 align:start position:0%
here because Connecticut is actually
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
tribal gaming which is an entirely
 
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
different category um it's not State
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
authorized it's federally authorized by
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
the Indian gaming regulatory act so um
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
Charlie I did this for a point point of
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
reference in terms of the numbers the
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
facilities how how large they are what
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
licenses fees they have to pay what the
 
01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
take what their percentage they have to
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
pay to the state etc etc can you let's
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
go to main facts sure this
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
page yep can you just walk through that
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
table as to what these numbers
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
are um sure so certainly uh this is
 
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
Maine's calendar year 2022 so this slot
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
machine game gross Gaming revenue is
 
01:29:48.189 --> 01:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
essentially the money that's left after
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
payment of
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
prizes um if I recall corre
 
01:29:56.590 --> 01:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
correctly um Hollywood pays a 39% share
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
to the state and Oxford pays
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
46% uh for slot machines for tables I
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
believe it's
 
01:30:07.149 --> 01:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
15% so the gross gaming rep this table
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
ggr is what's left after payment of
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
prizes and then the taxes obviously
 
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:15.400 align:start position:0%
taking into account that um labor costs
 
01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
and surveillance and security for
 
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
physical tables is much much more
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
expensive um
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
and those numbers are reflected on table
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
taxes what goes to the state and then
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
what the total gross Gaming revenue is
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
for those two um functions and then what
 
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
the state's take is so in calendar year
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
2022 um Maine from Hollywood Casino in
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
Banger received 24 million and Oxford
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
they receive 44 million Oxford being
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
within driving distance quite easily
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
from the Hampshire border if I um maybe
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
five years ago I had a staff member
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
visit the Oxford facility in Oxford and
 
01:30:59.709 --> 01:30:59.719 align:start position:0%
count license plates it's about the best
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
way to figure out what the revenue is
 
01:31:03.109 --> 01:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire and it's about one in
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
five cars and Oxford was from New
 
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I assume one of that
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue to be our
 
01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
citizens so you're saying that between
 
01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
the two Oxford and Hollywood that the
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
correct okay and then the next page
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
relates to the fees involved and the
 
01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
activity yeah maybe we want to spend
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
some more time on this why don't we all
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
take a look at this and maybe next
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
meeting we could we could use we have a
 
01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
little more of a discussion around this
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
sure u m um my counterparts in Maine
 
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
don't run the casinos the there's a
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
casino control board in main that runs
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
it okay and their own by I know the
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
facility in Oxford is owned by Churchill
 
01:31:56.109 --> 01:31:56.119 align:start position:0%
Downs right and I don't remember who
 
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
owns Hollywood to you know it's uh pen
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
entertainment pen ENT okay pen pen yeah
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
pen does okay okay all right this would
 
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
be very helpful I think yeah just yeah
 
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's just a comparator in terms of what
 
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
other states are doing and what they're
 
01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
receiving yeah so what we want to do is
 
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
again let's let's now talk about the uh
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
we have the 150,000 um
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh that some of that is going to a
 
01:32:29.109 --> 01:32:29.119 align:start position:0%
consultant uh of our
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
choice uh what I think we need to agree
 
01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
upon as a commission here is what are we
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
looking for in a consultant what we're
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
looking for regulations proper or the
 
01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
allocation dollar allocations proper we
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
have to kind of agree on um what we want
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
out of of Consulting before we can then
 
01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.510 align:start position:0%
out of of Consulting before we can then
I

01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
Charlie and I met um to talk about this
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
um offline and uh there there's choices
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know you have names of
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
Consultants that we could
 
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
use um but we need he needs all the
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
guidance as to who we send the rfps out
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
to and what we
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
say and the other thing is I'm assuming
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
that this is a bid situation but maybe
 
01:33:18.669 --> 01:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
not yeah chairman um certainly it would
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
be remarkably helpful for us to have a
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
scope of work from this Commission
 
01:33:25.149 --> 01:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
right um I would have to bid it out it's
 
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
not particularly long period I had been
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
informed this morning by our CFO that I
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
would need
 
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
to the we would need to go to GNC for
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
its approval as well and so that process
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
adds time and so the sooner we can sort
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
of think of a scope of work the better I
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to Appo a
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to create a scope of work I
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
guess I'd first like to ask the
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
membership as to what you hope a
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
consultant or Consultants would do
 
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
because certainly there's a number of to
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
topics you could delve into one is
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
economics one is sort of Regulation
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
governance all all manner of things so
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
um you know I leave the open question to
 
01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.830 align:start position:0%
um you know I leave the open question to
the

01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
body so dick I know you have some stuff
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
you want to say on this but maybe
 
01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
not well I can't do a
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
list I can't do a list as I said here uh
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
by a long shot um but um as I said we
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
need information about what other states
 
01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
are doing this is a start right here but
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh sort of
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
a Step Beyond that would be what a
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
consultant would allow sort of the wise
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
uh and the context for the decisions
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
made in massachusett Maine Kentucky
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
Wyoming where there's historic horse
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
racing um getting a good look at that in
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
relationship to our starting point with
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
our historic horse basing machines and
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
our charal gaming unique
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
situation and that history putting it
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
all together is what a a consultant
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
could could do for us providing that
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
additional context from each of these
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
states but I I you know question doing a
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
scope of work is what you're after I
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
understand that makes sense um and I
 
01:35:19.109 --> 01:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
guess we've got to work on that as soon
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
as possible because time the clock TI
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the uh approval process is uh it's
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
just takes
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
time well maybe a subcommittee is not a
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
bad idea just to um I guess we have to
 
01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
do things in public though to do
 
01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:39.030 align:start position:0%
do things in public though to do
that

01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
um just point of clarification if
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
there's subcommittee is less than a
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
membership Quorum does it have to be
 
01:35:46.510 --> 01:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
public I'm not that I'm I'm trying to
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
not be transparent obviously the scope
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
of work would be public document but I
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that question I think
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
I think everything we do is public okay
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
um um I think we need
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
to Charlie I mean I would certainly
 
01:36:09.149 --> 01:36:09.159 align:start position:0%
volunteer Mr chairman if you want to
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
point a sub committee I'll certainly
 
01:36:13.950 --> 01:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
it um I'll be a member who else who else
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
would be member we got okay Aaron
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
red me
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
G um anybody
 
01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.910 align:start position:0%
G um anybody
else

01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right we'd have to meet next
 
01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
week week
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
then so and I'd have to get in the
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
calendar and get a room yeah so we you
 
01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
meet in my office conference room it'll
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
be open to the public yeah okay if
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's okay with everyone yeah right I
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
don't want to dictate to people but
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
certainly my office is available no we
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
use the conference room so it's public
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
people yeah exactly it's a signing sheet
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
K good
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
today Monday right it's a Monday right
 
01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:20.679 align:start position:0%
so yeah we can get in the calendar in
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
time to meet next week all right very
 
01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
good so that that'll resolve that and
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
then the other question was on the
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
budget that you had there was money
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
for uh newsletters and other
 
01:37:37.149 --> 01:37:37.159 align:start position:0%
things and I think the group said yeah
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
we we should spend some of that money on
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
on some
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
Publications is that do you have
 
01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
specific ones that you would recommend
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
Charlie well certainly the first was the
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's item nine on the agenda um the
 
01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
the na uh National Council on
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
legislators with gaming States I think
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
it's that's the it's called nickel G's
 
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
that's it's an acronym um we actually
 
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
submitted that for approval for um
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
budgeting for membership okay and that
 
01:38:09.589 --> 01:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
kicked back to us by admin services that
 
01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
we do have to go to GNC as well for that
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
um so we have to go to GNC so that means
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman yeah no problem okay um
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to attend with you if you want
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so just as a question because
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's while it's this body it's coming
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
out of our budget not that it's our
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
budget but it's this commission's budget
 
01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
but it's certainly a a unit under the
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
lottery budget but there there's good
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
data in this yeah yeah no exactly
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
there's it's a membership we belong to a
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
number of groups uh North American
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
lotteries World Lottery Association
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
Tri-State so it's a membership
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
organization to learn more about gaming
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
and access their resources and what's
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
the what's the annual membership
 
01:38:52.239 --> 01:38:54.709 align:start position:0%
the what's the annual membership
$5,000

01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
$5,000
 
01:38:57.550 --> 01:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
okay you do have that budgeted right
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
correct like yes um I submit I I think I
 
01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
set the budget around last time yeah you
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
did and I'm trying it's in my pile here
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere I was trying to find it but
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I know we did yeah so all right why
 
01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
don't we do this oh here it is
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
Consultants was uh 10,000 10 oh no the
 
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
Consultants was one thing the membership
 
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
membership fees was the 10 ,000 so I
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
guess probably Mr chairman I best to
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
this body to vote for approval of this
 
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I want to do right now
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh someone want to make a motion to
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
approve uh the National Council of
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
membership 5000 yeah let's let's approve
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
the money is it well if we get to
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
specific then it if it's for Mar at 4,99
 
01:39:55.390 --> 01:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
and I would just suggest we approve
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
membership in the yeah it is submitted
 
01:39:59.709 --> 01:39:59.719 align:start position:0%
as an invoice for 5,000 but they may
 
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
change so okay all right I need a
 
01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:05.030 align:start position:0%
change so okay all right I need a
second

01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
discussion excuse me thank you Mr
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
chairman aren't people from the house
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
already going to this
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I think they've gone to
 
01:40:26.189 --> 01:40:26.199 align:start position:0%
it I don't think we're members I think
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
because I've checked the I checked the
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
website maybe two weeks ago and our
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
state wasn't a
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
member okay all right so I I because
 
01:40:36.189 --> 01:40:36.199 align:start position:0%
we've are we've
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
been yeah Kelly's been in contact with
 
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
their office and so I don't they'd love
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
us to be
 
01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
members okay okay so no other discussion
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
okay all in favor say I I all opposed no
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
okay we'll move forward with it and just
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
keep me posted on the uh GN whatever see
 
01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
yeah all right
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
um all right I think that's the agenda
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
for today
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about the next
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
meeting I'd like to get two more
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
meetings in before Christmas if we can
 
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
just to keep this moving yeah Mr
 
01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah just for future meetings
 
01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
anyway here okay is um basically
 
01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
addressing the what I we call the
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
in-house advertising for the you know
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
for the Charities again because I
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
visited several of the uh of the large
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
gaming houses appalled that the only the
 
01:41:36.589 --> 01:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
only place if you want that the that the
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
charity is mentioned is on the license
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
you know it's next to the uh
 
01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
cashiers it's a it's something that
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
basically again we're we're putting up
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
part of the money through the rent uh
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
that it's again I think that can be
 
01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
fairly inexpensive if you want in these
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
facilities to at least have that yeah
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
this is the uh friends of of legislature
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's friends of dogs if you want okay
 
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
that are sponsoring this and uh at least
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
put it into people's mind a little bit
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
because that's that's the non monetary
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
if you want okay uh ability to go over
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
and at least connect with these eyeballs
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
that are in there right okay we'll
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
discuss that I I've been to some
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
facilities that do like we CH earlier do
 
01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.350 align:start position:0%
facilities that do like we CH earlier do
public

01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:42:24.189 --> 01:42:24.199 align:start position:0%
the chat they supposed to let me ask you
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
the question we supposed to it it has it
 
01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
has to be conspicuously
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
posted if you couldn't find it that's
 
01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.070 align:start position:0%
posted if you couldn't find it that's
not

01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
conspicuous okay it's We Will We Will We
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
it's something that's on our
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
investigators uh list when they go into
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
a facility but we'll make sure that we
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
emphasize that
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay all right so I'm looking at now
 
01:42:49.149 --> 01:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving is early everybody gets you
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
know you know it's we still have a whole
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
week after Thanksgiving that's
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
November I was looking at maybe Thursday
 
01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:01.270 align:start position:0%
November I was looking at maybe Thursday
November

01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
30th me it's Monday morning a good day
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
for everyone I don't want to do it I
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it the Monday right
 
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
after Thanksgiving because people are
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
probably still traveling home from
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
wherever they may be going that weekend
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean the 30th I'm trying to keep
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
it to Mondays especially during
 
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
legislation season where there least
 
01:43:22.589 --> 01:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
amount of stuff going on as a
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
Monday but since legisl is not in right
 
01:43:27.629 --> 01:43:27.639 align:start position:0%
now I'm thinking that it'd be okay for
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
legislators if we did it on a Thursday
 
01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:30.669 align:start position:0%
legislators if we did it on a Thursday
or

01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:30.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
I or Friday that week
 
01:43:38.109 --> 01:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
yeah is there a way to do it two-way
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
digitally so if members can't make
 
01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
it uh well right now the this is being
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
streamed but it's not a two-way stream I
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
could talk to the tech people but Mr
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
chairman we could do that to my
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
office we have two-way stream if you
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
want and under the law the quum only
 
01:43:59.709 --> 01:43:59.719 align:start position:0%
counts is five and so five are
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
physically here if members are away
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
there'd be no violation of the open
 
01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
Quorum I'm actually away that week but
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
if we did have you know ability to phone
 
01:44:18.030 --> 01:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
in or or video in whatever I could do
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
that okay we could do it with Lottery we
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
Prof from just to Tech certainly um we
 
01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
have a smart TV and cameras so yeah I'm
 
01:44:29.790 --> 01:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
making promises from RT department so
 
01:44:30.990 --> 01:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
they'll have to they have three weeks to
 
01:44:32.669 --> 01:44:32.679 align:start position:0%
figure it out because I originally
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
thinking that we should meet at lottery
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
for all our meetings but because of
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
um Senator de Sandro's you know
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
physical limitations now I thought it'd
 
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
be kind of hard for him to go over there
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
and get a ride back you know although we
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
could probably arrange it to to pick
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
them up and and go over there so um so
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
why are we okay so you can't make that
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
date huh either those I'll be out of
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
state yeah anybody else can't be here I
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
can't make the 30th I'm book solid that
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
day how about the how about the Friday
 
01:45:10.589 --> 01:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
the Friday um the next day that'll be
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:45:17.709 --> 01:45:17.719 align:start position:0%
yeah um anytime after 11:30 in the
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
morning all right so that'll be one
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
clock meeting I can't be here that week
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
but I could be digitally as well right
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
two can't be there that week all right
 
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
why don't we why don't we just step to
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
um that would be December the week first
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
full week of
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
December we do it the 4th the Monday the
 
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
four December 4th same time 10 o'clock
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
yeah try to keep it 10 is that all right
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
okay I guess we could stay here um it
 
01:46:07.950 --> 01:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
will either be in this room or back at
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
the state house if we can get the bigger
 
01:46:12.589 --> 01:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
room in the state house and did you want
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
to do two before Christmas Mr chairman
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
that was my goal but um I don't know
 
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about it next time we'll talk
 
01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
about the next date
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
um then Christmas comes up we got to
 
01:46:26.910 --> 01:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
stay away from Christmas
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
week maybe just the 18th is two weeks
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
fourth what what you say the 18th 18th
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
the 18th is yeah we could probably do it
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
the 18th it'll be two weeks but why
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
don't we tentatively say the 18th for
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
the okay second one saying the next
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
4th you good okay all right now let us
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
back to the room
 
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
again I'm trying to think of Lou if Lou
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
can't make it maybe it'd be better to do
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
it in lottery so he can he
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
can can dial in I I like I prefer people
 
01:47:24.430 --> 01:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
to be physically here which is more
