00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 align:start position:0%

full business status in the next 3-4
 
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 align:start position:0%

hi everyone and thank you for having us
 
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.749 align:start position:0%
hi everyone and thank you for having us
today

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
so here in the Upper Valley we've been
 
00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 align:start position:0%
very fortunate I know one of the
 
00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
questions when Susan asked me to appear
 
00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
today was how many businesses have we
 
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 align:start position:0%
had that will close permanently that we
 
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 align:start position:0%
know of so far and I think we've
 
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 align:start position:0%
actually been four
 
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 align:start position:0%
that we have not had many we've had to
 
00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 align:start position:0%
businesses and Hanover closed
 
00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 align:start position:0%
permanently due to the köppen 19
 
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 align:start position:0%
situation and we've had a few businesses
 
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon also closed although none of
 
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 align:start position:0%
them were related to the köppen 19
 
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
situation two of our major retailers pr1
 
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 align:start position:0%
and JC Penney's are closing and and
 
00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 align:start position:0%
those are due to you know forces in the
 
00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 align:start position:0%
in the major retail world and then we've
 
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
had a small diner that closed due to
 
00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 align:start position:0%
personal reasons that was just prior to
 
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 align:start position:0%
the köppen situation
 
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 align:start position:0%
however I am concerned that we've had we
 
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 align:start position:0%
will have businesses that will close
 
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 align:start position:0%
soon in in the next few months and my
 
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 align:start position:0%
concern is due to the fact that right
 
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 align:start position:0%
now our businesses many have applied for
 
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
the PPP funds or the idle loans through
 
00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
the SBA and they have received those
 
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 align:start position:0%
monies but you know it nowhere near
 
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 align:start position:0%
replaces the funds that they have lost
 
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
in revenue over the last couple of
 
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 align:start position:0%
months during this situation so I'm I am
 
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 align:start position:0%
concerned that from talking to our
 
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 align:start position:0%
businesses that you know although
 
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 align:start position:0%
they've received those funds some of
 
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 align:start position:0%
them are really hanging on by their
 
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 align:start position:0%
fingernails and and even as we're
 
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 align:start position:0%
starting to reopen you know it's still
 
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 align:start position:0%
not easy you know restaurants are able
 
00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 align:start position:0%
to reopen now for outdoor dining however
 
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
I think that is more of a benefit to our
 
00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 align:start position:0%
restaurants that tend to be smaller in
 
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
scale where you know they can have the
 
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
outdoor space and have almost as many
 
00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 align:start position:0%
tables as they had functioning indoors
 
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
as normal but we have some of larger
 
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
restaurants for instance in Hanover
 
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 align:start position:0%
Mali's and Jesse's which is owned by the
 
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 align:start position:0%
blue sky
 
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Group which chose not to
 
00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 align:start position:0%
reopen because their their very large
 
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 align:start position:0%
establishments the costs for them to
 
00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
reopen are huge I was told around
 
00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 align:start position:0%
$100,000 just to buy enough food to be
 
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 align:start position:0%
able to support their typical menu and
 
00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 align:start position:0%
there's just not no way for them to have
 
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 align:start position:0%
enough outdoor seating to be able to
 
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 align:start position:0%
accommodate for that like they would in
 
00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 align:start position:0%
their their regular operations some of
 
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 align:start position:0%
our our smaller businesses are still
 
00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 align:start position:0%
struggling there's a lot of even though
 
00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 align:start position:0%
they're all following the guidelines put
 
00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 align:start position:0%
out by the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 align:start position:0%
Public Health and and the Gopher
 
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 align:start position:0%
committee there's a lot of inconsistency
 
00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 align:start position:0%
with those guidelines and and so they're
 
00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 align:start position:0%
they're struggling with that a bit Wendy
 
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 align:start position:0%
would you want to chime in um thank you
 
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 align:start position:0%
for having me as Susan said I'm the
 
00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 align:start position:0%
president of the Greater Merrimack so he
 
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 align:start position:0%
can Valley Chamber of Commerce and I
 
00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 align:start position:0%
also in the current board chair of the
 
00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association to chamber
 
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
commerce executives and so it's with
 
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 align:start position:0%
both those hats I'm gonna be talking to
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
you today I my chamber covers the twelve
 
00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 align:start position:0%
towns of the Merrimack and so he can
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
Valley region also in neck to Nashua and
 
00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and beyond you know we have a
 
00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
lot of businesses that have yet to open
 
00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:00.969 align:start position:0%
I worry as a chamber person about you
 
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
know a few things one what are the
 
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 align:start position:0%
habits of shoppers gonna be now that
 
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 align:start position:0%
businesses are reopening i I don't think
 
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
from 90 days ago we can expect this to
 
00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 align:start position:0%
jump right into business as usual also
 
00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259 align:start position:0%
at the end of July when the extra $600
 
00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 align:start position:0%
that is are part of people's
 
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 align:start position:0%
unemployment checks coming to an end
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
unless Congress extends it people are
 
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 align:start position:0%
going to be short on cash so I do worry
 
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
about having enough customers I worry
 
00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 align:start position:0%
about any regulation or any further
 
00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 align:start position:0%
specifically I would say the business
 
00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
specifically I would say the business
profits

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 align:start position:0%
profits
 
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 align:start position:0%
or the business enterprise tax as you
 
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 align:start position:0%
all know any business who makes over
 
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 align:start position:0%
50000 gross is going to be expected to
 
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 align:start position:0%
report and I know last year that the
 
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislature had an agreement with the
 
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 align:start position:0%
governor that the business profits taxes
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
and the beatty would not be raised
 
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180 align:start position:0%
beyond 2019 rates so I do ask you to
 
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind as you consider you
 
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 align:start position:0%
know the state revenues which I know are
 
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 align:start position:0%
going to be down as a result of this but
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
I do worry about any further burden on
 
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 align:start position:0%
our businesses I think we're not going
 
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 align:start position:0%
to know for many months to come how our
 
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.630 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:25.390 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea about what's going
 
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910 align:start position:0%
on with your your restaurant situation
 
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.330 align:start position:0%
or any of your manufacturing any of the
 
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.630 align:start position:0%
bigger bound fixtures in your area
 
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:39.670 align:start position:0%
because Hittner and Aileen and some of
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
the air Mar have been able to pivot
 
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.550 align:start position:0%
they're doing all right on this in our
 
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
region restaurants it's been slow I mean
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
they they've really tried to accommodate
 
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
outdoor seating
 
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:56.890 align:start position:0%
obviously it's weather dependent their
 
00:07:59.940 --> 00:07:59.950 align:start position:0%
capacity I'll give an example I went to
 
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hills outdoors the other night
 
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:02.830 align:start position:0%
when it opened it's one of my members
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
and the tables are definitely spaced
 
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:06.580 align:start position:0%
apart and I counted maybe in the whole
 
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
evening maybe 50 dinars which you know
 
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.330 align:start position:0%
normally they would typically do about
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
200 the owners were actually working it
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
and have not brought back their staff
 
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:18.970 align:start position:0%
their staff as for restaurants in the
 
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
northern part I don't know how they
 
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:22.990 align:start position:0%
fared this past weekend I would like to
 
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.050 align:start position:0%
that information myself I know that from
 
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:27.550 align:start position:0%
a meeting with Taylor causal this
 
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:29.890 align:start position:0%
morning that our tolls were down 40
 
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:31.900 align:start position:0%
percent from a typical Memorial Day
 
00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:33.669 align:start position:0%
weekend which indicates to me that
 
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:35.830 align:start position:0%
obviously there were not people spending
 
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:38.950 align:start position:0%
money in the in the state you know we
 
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:41.430 align:start position:0%
have warmer weather down here in Amherst
 
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:44.500 align:start position:0%
as compared to up in Littleton or Conway
 
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:49.210 align:start position:0%
so I would hope that the governor at
 
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:51.460 align:start position:0%
some point is going to open the you know
 
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:53.370 align:start position:0%
the indoor parks a restaurant
 
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example I was just down
 
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:56.670 align:start position:0%
in Florida on my home state visiting my
 
00:08:58.249 --> 00:08:58.259 align:start position:0%
parents and the restaurants opened a
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
week ago for the outdoors but they can
 
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
also now have fifty percent capacity
 
00:09:04.249 --> 00:09:04.259 align:start position:0%
indoors which was like every other table
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that was actually a good
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
good model because you didn't have
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
people on top of each other they were
 
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:13.230 align:start position:0%
also having you you know use hand
 
00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:15.149 align:start position:0%
sanitizer and wear a mask to your table
 
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:17.910 align:start position:0%
I think unless we can step it up with
 
00:09:19.429 --> 00:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
our restaurants and give them some more
 
00:09:22.309 --> 00:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
capacity I don't know it's already a
 
00:09:25.939 --> 00:09:25.949 align:start position:0%
tough business for most of them right
 
00:09:28.939 --> 00:09:28.949 align:start position:0%
and and I would chime in the our lodging
 
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
industry has been hit very very hard by
 
00:09:37.129 --> 00:09:37.139 align:start position:0%
this situation you know in in our region
 
00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:40.589 align:start position:0%
we have several hotels right now they're
 
00:09:44.809 --> 00:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
allowed to take in people looking for
 
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:47.910 align:start position:0%
rooms for essential personnel one of our
 
00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
hotels in Lebanon has has been doing
 
00:09:53.569 --> 00:09:53.579 align:start position:0%
okay with that however they've let
 
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.250 align:start position:0%
almost all of their staff go there's
 
00:09:59.720 --> 00:09:59.730 align:start position:0%
only around five of them that are you
 
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:01.470 align:start position:0%
know which is the upper management that
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
are doing everything from cleaning the
 
00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:08.009 align:start position:0%
rooms to taken in the reservations to do
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the maintenance we have several other
 
00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:15.029 align:start position:0%
hotels in the area that are not open or
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
are very very minimal and I think you
 
00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:22.829 align:start position:0%
know that going forward I know I have
 
00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:25.649 align:start position:0%
people who call our office from out of
 
00:10:29.059 --> 00:10:29.069 align:start position:0%
state and are looking for rooms but I
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see them coming back as
 
00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:34.589 align:start position:0%
quickly you know I don't think that
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
people are going to flood to the state
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
and people will be looking to take
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
vacations or hotel rooms like they were
 
00:10:45.439 --> 00:10:45.449 align:start position:0%
before and I think our hotels are going
 
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.110 align:start position:0%
to really suffer and you know hotel
 
00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:51.569 align:start position:0%
capacity is a very funny thing anyways
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
if if hotel runs at 65% capacity they're
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
considered successful and you know our
 
00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:01.589 align:start position:0%
hotels in the Upper Valley typically run
 
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:04.019 align:start position:0%
much higher so I think across the state
 
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:06.430 align:start position:0%
we're going to see hotels have enough
 
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:13.930 align:start position:0%
another concern that I'm seeing in our
 
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:16.750 align:start position:0%
area and hearing from landlords is gonna
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
have to do with not only residential
 
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
tenants but commercial tenants once the
 
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:27.490 align:start position:0%
governor you know enacted the the
 
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.070 align:start position:0%
executive order of you know to stop stop
 
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:32.950 align:start position:0%
foreclosures and conviction processes
 
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:38.190 align:start position:0%
etc that has really put a lot of our
 
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
business owners that you know have
 
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:42.850 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings or even even even
 
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:44.620 align:start position:0%
somebody with a two or three family if
 
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:46.450 align:start position:0%
they're not receiving the income from
 
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:48.850 align:start position:0%
that I'm hoping some of the Gopher
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
dollars are going to come to that
 
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:52.450 align:start position:0%
because also the businesses even though
 
00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:53.860 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be paying you know
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
twenty five percent of their PPP to rent
 
00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
it's not covering a lot of the expenses
 
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
so there's also concern what might
 
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:02.230 align:start position:0%
happen to the real estate market if
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
there isn't some sort of relief for the
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
land not the landowners the landlord's
 
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
and that will also trickle down to the
 
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:15.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities I know here in Lebanon or
 
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:18.670 align:start position:0%
rather West Lebanon the tenants of our
 
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:21.940 align:start position:0%
powerhouse mall have used force majeure
 
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:27.510 align:start position:0%
to not pay their rents to the mall and
 
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:31.180 align:start position:0%
that is something like a $22,000 per
 
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
month towards the city of Lebanon for
 
00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
tax purposes so the city of Lebanon has
 
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.250 align:start position:0%
been meeting with business owners to
 
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.070 align:start position:0%
discuss implementing some sort of
 
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:49.420 align:start position:0%
payment plan for taxes because they're
 
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:51.730 align:start position:0%
expecting that there's going to be
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
several businesses that will not be able
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
to pay their property taxes also
 
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:00.820 align:start position:0%
interesting I'm not sure who else lives
 
00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:02.649 align:start position:0%
in the southern part but as the malls
 
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
have opened down here a lot of the
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
stores continue to be closed at the
 
00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:10.899 align:start position:0%
outlet mall over on route 3 in Merrimack
 
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:14.500 align:start position:0%
it's you know I would say a third of the
 
00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:21.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:25.430 align:start position:0%
can we answer any questions for you oh
 
00:13:28.329 --> 00:13:28.339 align:start position:0%
yes we have three questions already
 
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:33.990 align:start position:0%
representative of Rami I was going to
 
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:36.870 align:start position:0%
follow up on that calm about retail I'm
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
more could be concerned like you do
 
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:43.290 align:start position:0%
about retail coming back because you
 
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
know my observation is even once they
 
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.050 align:start position:0%
opened it up that not a traffic is not
 
00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:00.209 align:start position:0%
there that's for stores I don't see
 
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:07.170 align:start position:0%
people going back to the anyway I know
 
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:14.490 align:start position:0%
and about five stores just vacant and
 
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
then obviously this close they have the
 
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:34.370 align:start position:0%
anchor stores that are closing and and
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
you know how many people are going to
 
00:14:40.699 --> 00:14:40.709 align:start position:0%
continue buying via online versus going
 
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:43.410 align:start position:0%
to the brick-and-mortar well you bring
 
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:45.690 align:start position:0%
up a great point I've definitely seen a
 
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:47.790 align:start position:0%
lot more Amazon Prime trucks in the area
 
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
in the last three months and that goes
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
back to people's personal shopping
 
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
habits and I think as chambers we've
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
done a pretty good job of getting the
 
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:00.630 align:start position:0%
message out to our communities and let
 
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:01.890 align:start position:0%
me just step back for a minute there are
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
about 50 chambers in the state of New
 
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:05.250 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we have been in constant
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
communication with one another under the
 
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:11.430 align:start position:0%
Association umbrella and this has been a
 
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
really a huge topic of ours we've done a
 
00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:18.089 align:start position:0%
really good job with really trying to
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
present to our communities I hope we've
 
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:21.810 align:start position:0%
done a good job presenting to our
 
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:23.610 align:start position:0%
communities without strong business
 
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:25.230 align:start position:0%
community we don't strong communities
 
00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:27.029 align:start position:0%
these these are the people that your
 
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:29.710 align:start position:0%
high schooler goes to to get a donation
 
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:32.170 align:start position:0%
you're attracting your boy scouts your
 
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:34.750 align:start position:0%
church you name it so I think we really
 
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:36.700 align:start position:0%
have to press upon and maybe that's
 
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
something you all can help with with
 
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:39.580 align:start position:0%
some type of advertising dollars of
 
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
unless you shop locally you know Amazon
 
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:44.140 align:start position:0%
is not going to be the one you know
 
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
supporting our communities it's
 
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:47.380 align:start position:0%
convenient but they're not going to
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
support them but but I agree with you
 
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
that it scares me in the three months
 
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:54.070 align:start position:0%
that people have been home that they'll
 
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:55.420 align:start position:0%
they're willing to go to Home Depot and
 
00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:57.700 align:start position:0%
Walmart and yet I haven't seen them in
 
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:01.570 align:start position:0%
the boutique's yet right and and we're
 
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:03.490 align:start position:0%
hearing the same thing from our small
 
00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:07.029 align:start position:0%
retailers is you know if you're a small
 
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:10.930 align:start position:0%
boutique and you sell clothing you know
 
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:12.310 align:start position:0%
you have if you're going to buy
 
00:16:15.449 --> 00:16:15.459 align:start position:0%
something you want to try it on well who
 
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:17.290 align:start position:0%
wants to go into a fitting room right
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
now you know there there's concerns over
 
00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
yet you know just some people are not
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
willing to go out yet or spend time
 
00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:29.950 align:start position:0%
shopping and and you know in the state
 
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:32.950 align:start position:0%
really hasn't been saying even though
 
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:35.260 align:start position:0%
businesses are open we still have a stay
 
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:37.690 align:start position:0%
at home order in place so there really
 
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.010 align:start position:0%
isn't an encouragement to do that you
 
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:45.310 align:start position:0%
know people are not sure whether to you
 
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:47.410 align:start position:0%
know do they wear face masks do they not
 
00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:51.850 align:start position:0%
wear a face mask obviously we all should
 
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
be wearing face masks not everyone
 
00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
agrees and and so therefore you know
 
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
I've heard from some of our businesses
 
00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:01.270 align:start position:0%
that their employees are concerned about
 
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:05.890 align:start position:0%
working are they going to be exposed so
 
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:07.630 align:start position:0%
there there's a lot of concerns and I
 
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't think consumer confidence is
 
00:17:12.929 --> 00:17:12.939 align:start position:0%
there yet to go out and support the
 
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:14.970 align:start position:0%
businesses you know some of our
 
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:17.850 align:start position:0%
restaurants have done okay with takeout
 
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
and people have stepped up to support
 
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:23.530 align:start position:0%
restaurants in that way but that's
 
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:26.140 align:start position:0%
that's a fairly easy ask you know you
 
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:28.510 align:start position:0%
drive you drive over you pick up your
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
food you take at home going out to spend
 
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:35.410 align:start position:0%
time in a in a small retail store to do
 
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:37.150 align:start position:0%
the kind of shopping that some of these
 
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
retailers need to survive it's not
 
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:43.660 align:start position:0%
happening yet well I keep in mind
 
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:45.790 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the fallouts gonna be
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
months from now with people's incomes I
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
mean are you more apt to stay at home
 
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:51.790 align:start position:0%
and cook after you've been to Walmart
 
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:53.980 align:start position:0%
then to go out into a restaurant or a
 
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:55.750 align:start position:0%
retail shop or whatever because you
 
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what your incomes gonna look
 
00:17:59.010 --> 00:17:59.020 align:start position:0%
like and already a lot of people taking
 
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:00.820 align:start position:0%
a huge hit so that worries me in the
 
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:02.020 align:start position:0%
recovery that people aren't gonna have
 
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
the money to spend
 
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:06.850 align:start position:0%
right and in some of our businesses so
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know Walmart is still doing fine you
 
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:13.150 align:start position:0%
know it sells the necessities that you
 
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:17.590 align:start position:0%
need it sells groceries but furniture
 
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:21.670 align:start position:0%
stores are not doing well you know
 
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:24.430 align:start position:0%
people are not planning for those larger
 
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.170 align:start position:0%
purposes the auto dealers are really on
 
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:32.500 align:start position:0%
life support at this point and for some
 
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
of them you know they have purchased
 
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:36.940 align:start position:0%
they have contracts with their
 
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:39.940 align:start position:0%
franchises and they have to purchase so
 
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:45.910 align:start position:0%
many autos or their find you know so so
 
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:47.890 align:start position:0%
the cars keep coming and they're being
 
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:50.170 align:start position:0%
delivered but they're not being sold and
 
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:53.110 align:start position:0%
if you drive around and you look at some
 
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:55.210 align:start position:0%
of these auto dealers you see full lots
 
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.090 align:start position:0%
and and if you were to go in you'll find
 
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
one or two people because for the most
 
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.090 align:start position:0%
part they've let their staff go the
 
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:05.890 align:start position:0%
other industry that's hurting I wouldn't
 
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:07.690 align:start position:0%
call an industry sector would be the
 
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:09.490 align:start position:0%
consultants the people that would come
 
00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:12.270 align:start position:0%
into your home and fix your computer or
 
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.130 align:start position:0%
I mean we have so many members that are
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
sole proprietors that do this type of
 
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:20.790 align:start position:0%
business you know recreating websites
 
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:22.990 align:start position:0%
Traci help me with consultants I'm
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
drawing a blank I'm sorry but I list but
 
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:27.460 align:start position:0%
you know any anybody that would come
 
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:28.660 align:start position:0%
into your home unless it's an emergency
 
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:30.970 align:start position:0%
like a plumber you know you're probably
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
not gonna have them come in your home so
 
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.020 align:start position:0%
those businesses are definitely I'm
 
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:39.610 align:start position:0%
hurting right right any of your your
 
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:42.670 align:start position:0%
small trades some what some of our
 
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:44.890 align:start position:0%
builders are doing okay I have a
 
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:47.530 align:start position:0%
gentleman who has a roofing business and
 
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:50.650 align:start position:0%
and he's actually not seen a lot of
 
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:54.850 align:start position:0%
downturn but like Wendy mentioned anyone
 
00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
that would go into the home norm
 
00:19:59.800 --> 00:19:59.810 align:start position:0%
your plumbers your electricians unless
 
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:02.270 align:start position:0%
you have something that's dire people
 
00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:05.150 align:start position:0%
are putting that off either either they
 
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:07.130 align:start position:0%
don't have the income to pay these
 
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:10.910 align:start position:0%
professionals or you know or if it's
 
00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.070 align:start position:0%
something that they can put off and and
 
00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:16.700 align:start position:0%
they're doing so so those people are
 
00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:28.220 align:start position:0%
seeing a loss of income as well since
 
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:31.010 align:start position:0%
then we can't hear you I'm sorry because
 
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:34.130 align:start position:0%
he unmuted you muted me when my phone
 
00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:35.300 align:start position:0%
went off again
 
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:39.910 align:start position:0%
I wish I could mute the phone yeah when
 
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
I've I've had a couple of urgent
 
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:44.930 align:start position:0%
problems that had to be resolved with a
 
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:46.940 align:start position:0%
home visit it took quite a while to
 
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:50.570 align:start position:0%
convince people to come and do the home
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
visit because they are afraid as well of
 
00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:57.650 align:start position:0%
contracting a virus that fear may be
 
00:20:59.740 --> 00:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
stronger in the Upper Valley because we
 
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
had had the first breakout in New
 
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:06.230 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of of the illness and since
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
that time people have been a lot more
 
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:17.090 align:start position:0%
willing to to sequester themselves but
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
we've got three hands up now I'm lips
 
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
Tommy yes this is Chris I think Tucker
 
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.050 align:start position:0%
may have been raised in with a question
 
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:28.310 align:start position:0%
that you just want to check with her as
 
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:34.220 align:start position:0%
well okay um well you know you can't you
 
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:40.220 align:start position:0%
can't raise your hand I'll take you
 
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:43.180 align:start position:0%
first here in the North Country
 
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:46.420 align:start position:0%
lots of people are not happy to see
 
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:50.690 align:start position:0%
people from other parts of the state or
 
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:53.090 align:start position:0%
you are from Massachusetts particularly
 
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:55.070 align:start position:0%
they're very if we've only had five
 
00:21:59.530 --> 00:21:59.540 align:start position:0%
cases and cause and people want people
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
to quarantine for two weeks if they come
 
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:04.910 align:start position:0%
to their summer home before they go out
 
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:08.270 align:start position:0%
shopping and doing things and they're
 
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:10.220 align:start position:0%
not happy to see them in store
 
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:14.510 align:start position:0%
they are afraid that we'll get infected
 
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:17.540 align:start position:0%
if we attract the tourists that we
 
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:19.580 align:start position:0%
ordinarily do I've had quite a
 
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:22.970 align:start position:0%
conversation by email with our local
 
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:25.730 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce about maybe the
 
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:28.610 align:start position:0%
state should put up signs saying wear a
 
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:34.790 align:start position:0%
mask always outside in stores but these
 
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:37.010 align:start position:0%
actually are rules they're guidelines
 
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
and the quarantining for two weeks seems
 
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to achieve you want a tourist
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
economy that people would come up and
 
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:49.700 align:start position:0%
rent a cottage or stay at the family
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
camp stay home for two weeks before they
 
00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:57.830 align:start position:0%
went anywhere so is this true in other
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
parts of the state that we have
 
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:02.990 align:start position:0%
represented you find that the local
 
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
population is dubious about trying to
 
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:09.230 align:start position:0%
resume the same activities as in the
 
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:12.290 align:start position:0%
past well I'll start because I'm right
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
on the border I will tell you that
 
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:17.690 align:start position:0%
despite all efforts to keep people from
 
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts etc as the governor says
 
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:23.270 align:start position:0%
out I decided to venture out this
 
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:25.730 align:start position:0%
weekend myself on to 101a down towards
 
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:27.290 align:start position:0%
Nashua and I thought oh I'll go to home
 
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:29.420 align:start position:0%
goods or something like that the parking
 
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
lots were full of Massachusetts cars the
 
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
lines were around the building and eat
 
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:36.770 align:start position:0%
in every single place I try to go to I
 
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
would just say personally I think it's
 
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:41.570 align:start position:0%
just unrealistic to try to keep people
 
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:43.250 align:start position:0%
out we do have the you know US
 
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution in the Commerce Clause and
 
00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:46.910 align:start position:0%
what I just hope recommend to people is
 
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
wear your masks wash your hands stay
 
00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:53.750 align:start position:0%
safely away from people because I at the
 
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
risk of using the words a new normal
 
00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:58.190 align:start position:0%
which I cannot stand it is kind of the
 
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:00.020 align:start position:0%
new normal and I I just think it's
 
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
unrealistic to I understand their point
 
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:05.450 align:start position:0%
especially if you're you know immune
 
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:07.700 align:start position:0%
system is compromised I would be very
 
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
system is compromised I would be very
nervous

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:08.530 align:start position:0%
nervous
 
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:12.140 align:start position:0%
but but you know I he that I think
 
00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:15.230 align:start position:0%
definitely people have that feeling
 
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:17.780 align:start position:0%
across the state but I think it's maybe
 
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:20.300 align:start position:0%
a pretty loud minority too because I
 
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:22.900 align:start position:0%
think most people are realistic that
 
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:26.350 align:start position:0%
some point we got to open up we see that
 
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:28.930 align:start position:0%
as well in the Upper Valley and I have
 
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:33.250 align:start position:0%
had people say to me you know there's
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
there's numerous people from out of
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
state that own second homes in this area
 
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:42.490 align:start position:0%
around Moscow Millay Cup in Orford and
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
and I have heard that same sentiment as
 
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:50.650 align:start position:0%
well I I do think however you know we I
 
00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:54.280 align:start position:0%
think the second largest industry in New
 
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is tourism and and I'm hoping
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
though that we will be able to open back
 
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
up and allow those people at some point
 
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:08.230 align:start position:0%
because those are important dollars for
 
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:10.950 align:start position:0%
our state and they do keep a lot of our
 
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
businesses going in the summer pan
 
00:25:18.419 --> 00:25:18.429 align:start position:0%
overseas something like 5,000 visitors
 
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:20.610 align:start position:0%
that come to Dartmouth College
 
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.010 align:start position:0%
throughout the summer and you know and
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
even though most of the students are
 
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:29.500 align:start position:0%
gone in the summertime that traffic
 
00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:32.830 align:start position:0%
keeps our downtown businesses going so I
 
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:35.830 align:start position:0%
I do hope at some point we can allow
 
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:39.090 align:start position:0%
those people those visitors to come back
 
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.130 align:start position:0%
so do you think we ought to be offering
 
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
that visitors free masks and not just
 
00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:50.620 align:start position:0%
the businesses well I'm not sure if the
 
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:53.020 align:start position:0%
well the state is just the governor
 
00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:54.790 align:start position:0%
announced last Friday that we're not
 
00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:56.950 align:start position:0%
offering free mass for the businesses
 
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
any longer they have two liquor store I
 
00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:05.140 align:start position:0%
I think you know at this point if if
 
00:26:07.049 --> 00:26:07.059 align:start position:0%
someone hasn't gone out and purchased
 
00:26:10.169 --> 00:26:10.179 align:start position:0%
themselves a cloth mass then there's
 
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:12.750 align:start position:0%
somebody who is not going to wear a mask
 
00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:15.700 align:start position:0%
regardless so I don't know about
 
00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:19.750 align:start position:0%
offering out of visitors mass but I I do
 
00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:22.990 align:start position:0%
hope at some point we can have them come
 
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:33.580 align:start position:0%
back yes thank you I live in the Upper
 
00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:35.380 align:start position:0%
Valley in the summer and no Hanna
 
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:36.250 align:start position:0%
Burwell right now
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a ghost town but I'm
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
concerned that so many businesses count
 
00:26:43.409 --> 00:26:43.419 align:start position:0%
on the large crowds in the summer long
 
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:45.820 align:start position:0%
lines sold out restaurants and all that
 
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:48.190 align:start position:0%
it's very hard for me to picture this
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
some are getting enough business for
 
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
some of those restaurants to survive my
 
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:54.490 align:start position:0%
other thing that hasn't been mentioned
 
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:56.950 align:start position:0%
by anyone right now Dartmouth coach
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
isn't running my bus company C&amp;J
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
Trailways there's no buses
 
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:03.490 align:start position:0%
so obviously this has got to be part of
 
00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:08.049 align:start position:0%
the picture too yes and and there's some
 
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:10.030 align:start position:0%
areas of the state that do rely heavily
 
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:13.330 align:start position:0%
on bus traffic for visitors throughout
 
00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:17.020 align:start position:0%
the state our area sees numerous buses
 
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:20.500 align:start position:0%
come through as well and I think that is
 
00:27:23.399 --> 00:27:23.409 align:start position:0%
going to be a concern the other thing to
 
00:27:24.779 --> 00:27:24.789 align:start position:0%
remember particularly with the
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
restaurants is right now it's all
 
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:30.610 align:start position:0%
weather dependent yes they can put tents
 
00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
weather dependent yes they can put tents
up

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:31.210 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:33.309 align:start position:0%
but those tents are not allowed to have
 
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:38.380 align:start position:0%
sides on them so if if we get a a hard
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
summer rainstorm anyone who is sitting
 
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:44.950 align:start position:0%
there is very likely going to get wet as
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
they try to eat their food so you know
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
it's it's all very very weather
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
dependent and and that's certainly going
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
to affect our restaurants and your right
 
00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:58.030 align:start position:0%
hand over which is usually a very
 
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:00.850 align:start position:0%
difficult place to find a parking space
 
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:05.230 align:start position:0%
is very easy right now to find parking
 
00:28:07.799 --> 00:28:07.809 align:start position:0%
spaces it is it is very much a ghost
 
00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:14.919 align:start position:0%
town I could also comment on you were
 
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:17.350 align:start position:0%
talking about summer crowds I asked this
 
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
exact question this morning of Taylor as
 
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
well we have a weekly call with him as
 
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:26.110 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce leaders and my
 
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
question was exactly that because so
 
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:29.770 align:start position:0%
many businesses including ours all the
 
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:31.270 align:start position:0%
Chamber's have you know events planned
 
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:33.490 align:start position:0%
that keep our budgets afloat and most
 
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:35.620 align:start position:0%
haven't been canceled so my question to
 
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:38.140 align:start position:0%
him was you know in these outdoor events
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
you know would we be able to have more
 
00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:43.390 align:start position:0%
than 10 people and he said to look to
 
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:45.580 align:start position:0%
the guidelines of like the racetracks
 
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
you know where you could have
 
00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:49.130 align:start position:0%
you know a group of 10 people you know
 
00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:50.540 align:start position:0%
like just like if they were your friends
 
00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
and then space it out six weeks six feet
 
00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:55.340 align:start position:0%
have another group of ten you know that
 
00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:56.930 align:start position:0%
people that knew each other so sometimes
 
00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:58.340 align:start position:0%
this would be groups of four groups of
 
00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
six groups of ten and that we would be
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
able to have more than ten people so in
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
the lines that I'm seeing I know exactly
 
00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:06.770 align:start position:0%
you're talking about like lining up for
 
00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:09.980 align:start position:0%
ice cream or you know fried clams they
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
are doing a pretty good job of putting
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
tape down and and you know just keeping
 
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:16.730 align:start position:0%
people six feet apart you know but
 
00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:17.990 align:start position:0%
you're right is that realistic for
 
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:19.340 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people lining up probably
 
00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:26.190 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people lining up probably
not

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:28.970 align:start position:0%
speaking of tourism one of the things I
 
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
would ask you to consider also as I know
 
00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:34.460 align:start position:0%
state revenues are going to be down
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
significantly but since we are going to
 
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:43.310 align:start position:0%
need tourism and tourism to come back to
 
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
support so many of our businesses not
 
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:48.860 align:start position:0%
just restaurants and lodging but you
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
know those people come and they they
 
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:54.350 align:start position:0%
shop in the retail stores and they help
 
00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:57.260 align:start position:0%
support you know numerous trades people
 
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:00.500 align:start position:0%
with you know summer homes and work on
 
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:04.370 align:start position:0%
that is to consider not cutting the
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism budget I know it's
 
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:11.780 align:start position:0%
it's probably under consideration but I
 
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:14.390 align:start position:0%
hope that if you do cut it it won't be
 
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
too major too deep of a cut because
 
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:20.650 align:start position:0%
we're certainly going to need that but
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
advertising to get people to back to the
 
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:29.780 align:start position:0%
state when we're able to reel them can I
 
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:32.090 align:start position:0%
ask a question I'm if you all I'm
 
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:34.790 align:start position:0%
hearing a particular date that lodging
 
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:36.950 align:start position:0%
might open I don't know about you Tracy
 
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:38.810 align:start position:0%
I'm here in June 8th is anyone else
 
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:40.580 align:start position:0%
hearing that lodging might possibly
 
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:46.730 align:start position:0%
reopen June 8th doesn't look like it we
 
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:49.510 align:start position:0%
only have one member that is on these
 
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:52.460 align:start position:0%
Commission's and he's new he's new to
 
00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
the committee and couldn't come
 
00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:58.670 align:start position:0%
because he's in the opening commission
 
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:04.610 align:start position:0%
god but we could try and ask him uh
 
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:07.220 align:start position:0%
we've got another question from
 
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg ever since
 
00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:22.830 align:start position:0%
Chandler he's so muted I keep pushing on
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
you'd hear how about now you're okay
 
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:29.850 align:start position:0%
okay Thank You Tracy and Wendy for
 
00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
appearing today Wendy basically you
 
00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:36.450 align:start position:0%
mentioned something about your comment
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
about tax rates do you have any
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
statistics from a reliable source that
 
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:45.530 align:start position:0%
show of a reduction in the BPT tax rates
 
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
proposed by the governor would have a
 
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
positive impact on state revenue for
 
00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:53.790 align:start position:0%
state services I wasn't talking about a
 
00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
reduction in taxes I was just talking
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
about you know just in general that I
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
would worry if taxes were increased from
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
the 2019 2020 levels i I didn't I'm not
 
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:09.810 align:start position:0%
saying either way reduction I was just
 
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:12.510 align:start position:0%
concerned if they were raised thank you
 
00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:15.570 align:start position:0%
I actually had not heard that he was
 
00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:18.150 align:start position:0%
proposing to reduce them but I'm not
 
00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:21.630 align:start position:0%
gonna look like you guys are we have
 
00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:24.750 align:start position:0%
trouble reading the tea leaves about
 
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
these things the problem we can't print
 
00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:29.970 align:start position:0%
money and we do provide everybody
 
00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:34.350 align:start position:0%
essential services and if we don't
 
00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
provide them the property taxes are
 
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.010 align:start position:0%
going up so and representative Malloy
 
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:48.410 align:start position:0%
was next I I want to back up to the
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
advertising budget and marketing for the
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I how much is in
 
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:02.310 align:start position:0%
that wine how much do we how much do we
 
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
spend and where do we spend it
 
00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:08.450 align:start position:0%
because if if that is of a concern to
 
00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:13.730 align:start position:0%
chambers and businesses in this state
 
00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
then we probably should be taught not us
 
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:19.110 align:start position:0%
but somebody should be talking about how
 
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:21.210 align:start position:0%
to prioritize that if indeed we even
 
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:24.750 align:start position:0%
keep it so that's just that's my
 
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
question well I don't know if anybody
 
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
here has an answer to it but I don't I'd
 
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:32.490 align:start position:0%
like to see a lot more information about
 
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:37.170 align:start position:0%
that Thanks I believe in advocating for
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
that regularly every chance I get I got
 
00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:52.650 align:start position:0%
restaurants and lodging people that we
 
00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
would increase the rooms and meals tax
 
00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:58.350 align:start position:0%
twelve years ago whatever it was and but
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
we would give them the ability through
 
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:05.610 align:start position:0%
what is now the Business and Economic
 
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
Affairs Department to do advertising in
 
00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:13.460 align:start position:0%
whatever markets would be most
 
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:18.030 align:start position:0%
reasonable to advertise in given the
 
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
economic situation so when we're in
 
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
recession and the rest of the world is
 
00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:24.770 align:start position:0%
in recession they're going to go after
 
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Connecticut and etc
 
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
and maybe Quebec and when we're doing
 
00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
for everybody's doing fairly well and
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
here traffic is cheap they go after
 
00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
Europe and sometimes China maybe I'm not
 
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead
 
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:48.330 align:start position:0%
I would I sit on the New Hampshire
 
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
Travel Council and I believe this last
 
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
year they were funded at about eight
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars which there's a certain
 
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:01.230 align:start position:0%
percentage and I'm forgetting what that
 
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:03.990 align:start position:0%
percentage is of rooms and meals tax I
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
believe that they are allocated however
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
I think this is the first year they've
 
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:11.370 align:start position:0%
actually received the full allocation
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
and and typically their budget is raided
 
00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:18.630 align:start position:0%
somewhat to fund other initial
 
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:22.590 align:start position:0%
in the state so I would urge you to
 
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
perhaps contact the New Hampshire Tribal
 
00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:27.990 align:start position:0%
Council and and talk with them who can
 
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
speak much better at it I'm just a
 
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:33.030 align:start position:0%
member at large however I do think that
 
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:35.430 align:start position:0%
the state does an excellent job with the
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
resources that they have because New
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's budget for the advertising
 
00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:43.230 align:start position:0%
and marketing tends to be much less than
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
other states and and yet we do receive
 
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of return on investment for
 
00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:56.190 align:start position:0%
the dollars that are spent so certainly
 
00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:57.870 align:start position:0%
someone from the council could speak
 
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:00.570 align:start position:0%
better to it but I think it's an
 
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:03.570 align:start position:0%
important part of the state and it
 
00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:06.980 align:start position:0%
concerns chambers we have several member
 
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:09.810 align:start position:0%
executives who sit on the Travel Council
 
00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
because we many of us do apply for the
 
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:17.430 align:start position:0%
jpp grants which come through the
 
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:20.730 align:start position:0%
Department of travel and tourism and we
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
use those funds to help with the
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
marketing of the state and in some cases
 
00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:28.950 align:start position:0%
assisting our businesses and and those
 
00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:31.290 align:start position:0%
funds go towards you know printing
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
guides or in some cases doing
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
advertising certainly you know the the
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
White Mountains receive its a lot of
 
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:44.730 align:start position:0%
benefit from that the Western White
 
00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
Mountain Chamber the Mount Washington
 
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:50.310 align:start position:0%
Valley Chamber they use those funds very
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
effectively to help support that region
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
so I would definitely explore that
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
further I'd like to add that the money
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
is how much money is going to be
 
00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:07.830 align:start position:0%
transferred over is in the budget each
 
00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:11.070 align:start position:0%
time and I think it only went down
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
substantially when speaker O'Brien was
 
00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
involved but they do they have had
 
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:28.290 align:start position:0%
studies showing that about $8 is created
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
for every $1 that's they're done by
 
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
for every $1 that's they're done by
Plymouth

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:32.010 align:start position:0%
Plymouth
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
University for every one dollar that we
 
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
spend which seems pretty good to me so
 
00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:46.770 align:start position:0%
representative Romney had a question yes
 
00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:48.390 align:start position:0%
this one's got to waiver I haven't
 
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:50.130 align:start position:0%
talked about that's entertainment
 
00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
and we have theaters a lot of regional
 
00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:56.130 align:start position:0%
theaters that are closed up right now is
 
00:37:58.610 --> 00:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
the place or the venues that do being
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:10.890 align:start position:0%
Fisher Cats for instance have you heard
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
it from any of your members that our
 
00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
members are that they want any of these
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
kind of businesses what are they
 
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.010 align:start position:0%
thinking about to me too many these are
 
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:25.710 align:start position:0%
going to be the businesses they're you
 
00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:27.990 align:start position:0%
know the last because they're large
 
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
groups and small confined areas they
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
they are struggling significantly you
 
00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:40.770 align:start position:0%
know here in Lebanon we have the Lebanon
 
00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:44.910 align:start position:0%
Opera House we have a Opera Company
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
offer north
 
00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:49.890 align:start position:0%
you know northern stage although that's
 
00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:52.170 align:start position:0%
across the river and Vermont but but
 
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:56.210 align:start position:0%
still any empty venues like that
 
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
community theaters almost all of whom
 
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
are also nonprofit organizations so
 
00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:07.230 align:start position:0%
there they're facing a double a double
 
00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:10.350 align:start position:0%
whammy here if you will because not only
 
00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:14.490 align:start position:0%
are they not allowed to open and have
 
00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:17.130 align:start position:0%
their revenue in some cases some of the
 
00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:18.930 align:start position:0%
shows that they've booked they have to
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
book sometimes almost a year in advance
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
and canceling an event like that they
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
still have expenses that are attributed
 
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
to that event even though it's been
 
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
to that event even though it's been
canceled

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:32.970 align:start position:0%
canceled
 
00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
there's contracts that have to be taken
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
care of and cancellation fees in some
 
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
case I I know our Lebanon Opera House
 
00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:45.330 align:start position:0%
here in Lebanon
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
has let go all of their staff only their
 
00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
executive director is left currently and
 
00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:55.590 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't look like they will be
 
00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:58.350 align:start position:0%
able to reopen and then on the other
 
00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:00.390 align:start position:0%
side of that they also rely on donations
 
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:03.630 align:start position:0%
or contributions and those of course are
 
00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
going to be down as well as as people
 
00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:08.370 align:start position:0%
are hanging on to the money and their
 
00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:11.730 align:start position:0%
wallet a little closer I think we will
 
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:13.650 align:start position:0%
see some of those clothes permanently as
 
00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:18.990 align:start position:0%
well the ones that have the ability to
 
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:21.930 align:start position:0%
hold functions outdoors are doing a
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
little better I know the Tupelo Music
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hall recently built a stage outside and
 
00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:30.570 align:start position:0%
did it like a drive-in theater you know
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
they had like a space in between it was
 
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
really kind of in junior that's the way
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
they did it not everybody's gonna be
 
00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
able to do that not the Palace Theatre
 
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:42.710 align:start position:0%
not as I'm Tracey said the Opera House
 
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
many of the with someone in Portsmouth
 
00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:49.350 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm blanking out anyhow it's
 
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:52.430 align:start position:0%
yeah you know you know I'm talking about
 
00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:54.990 align:start position:0%
movie theaters you know even if you did
 
00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:56.730 align:start position:0%
other every other seat which is not six
 
00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:58.590 align:start position:0%
feet I know they're trying to get
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines and they've been in front of
 
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
the reopening task force committee so
 
00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:03.990 align:start position:0%
let's hope they come up with some
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
solutions movie theaters are actually
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
struggling a bit before coated our
 
00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
nugget theater and Hanover has said that
 
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
they are struggling a bit because people
 
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:18.810 align:start position:0%
don't really go out to the movies as
 
00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:20.550 align:start position:0%
much as they used to they wait for it to
 
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
come out on Netflix so they have seen a
 
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
downturn anyways and and now with this I
 
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
think I think it's going to be very
 
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:34.770 align:start position:0%
tough for them going forward and there
 
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
are also art galleries and music I don't
 
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:47.210 align:start position:0%
know what exactly we've got a music
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
program that's totally nonprofit in
 
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
Lebanon that that bought its own very
 
00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:56.930 align:start position:0%
large house last year
 
00:41:59.799 --> 00:41:59.809 align:start position:0%
all of those are having trouble figuring
 
00:42:03.099 --> 00:42:03.109 align:start position:0%
out how they can provide services in
 
00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:05.990 align:start position:0%
those cases because they were doing them
 
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:10.210 align:start position:0%
in smaller rooms with small groups I
 
00:42:12.759 --> 00:42:12.769 align:start position:0%
think the other thing we have to look at
 
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:16.210 align:start position:0%
which kind of goes is kind of ecotourism
 
00:42:19.269 --> 00:42:19.279 align:start position:0%
would be the big festivals in the state
 
00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:20.990 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that draw tens of
 
00:42:22.599 --> 00:42:22.609 align:start position:0%
thousands of people you know obviously
 
00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:25.460 align:start position:0%
biker week up in the Lakes region all
 
00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:26.930 align:start position:0%
the different pumpkin festivals we do
 
00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:29.390 align:start position:0%
Tracy and I both ran the Milford Pumpkin
 
00:42:30.759 --> 00:42:30.769 align:start position:0%
Festival at different times and we would
 
00:42:32.739 --> 00:42:32.749 align:start position:0%
bring 45,000 people in over three days
 
00:42:35.499 --> 00:42:35.509 align:start position:0%
and the economic impact for the area was
 
00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:39.650 align:start position:0%
huge so just you know economic drivers
 
00:42:42.579 --> 00:42:42.589 align:start position:0%
like that if we're restricted and can't
 
00:42:44.499 --> 00:42:44.509 align:start position:0%
have big crowds which sounds to me like
 
00:42:45.819 --> 00:42:45.829 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to until
 
00:42:48.579 --> 00:42:48.589 align:start position:0%
there's a vaccine it's really going to
 
00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:50.420 align:start position:0%
hurt the communities that rely on those
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
events hand up again these theaters are
 
00:43:13.779 --> 00:43:13.789 align:start position:0%
closed these venues are closed
 
00:43:16.989 --> 00:43:16.999 align:start position:0%
even if restaurants open these papers
 
00:43:19.089 --> 00:43:19.099 align:start position:0%
are still closed we know that people who
 
00:43:20.859 --> 00:43:20.869 align:start position:0%
are out and they don't go to restaurant
 
00:43:22.779 --> 00:43:22.789 align:start position:0%
before or after the show that kind of
 
00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:27.890 align:start position:0%
thing so that's why yes and there are a
 
00:43:30.579 --> 00:43:30.589 align:start position:0%
lot of people who were getting income
 
00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:34.460 align:start position:0%
from these these projects which are not
 
00:43:39.999 --> 00:43:40.009 align:start position:0%
going to be spending income okay that's
 
00:43:46.809 --> 00:43:46.819 align:start position:0%
a depressing way to end this anybody
 
00:43:51.819 --> 00:43:51.829 align:start position:0%
bring music I I do want I can I can give
 
00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:54.230 align:start position:0%
us a positive note we actually held a
 
00:43:56.499 --> 00:43:56.509 align:start position:0%
ribbon-cutting last week for a new
 
00:44:00.099 --> 00:44:00.109 align:start position:0%
business that just opened and happens to
 
00:44:04.029 --> 00:44:04.039 align:start position:0%
be a restaurant in Enfield was obviously
 
00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:07.460 align:start position:0%
was working on opening prior to the Copa
 
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:10.350 align:start position:0%
19 situation
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
but did open for takeout for about a
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
week and then the order came down that
 
00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:20.330 align:start position:0%
they could do some outdoor seating and
 
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:23.250 align:start position:0%
there they're looking into that but they
 
00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:26.930 align:start position:0%
have only been open about two weeks and
 
00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:29.780 align:start position:0%
obviously they're having difficulties
 
00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
for one they're having difficulties with
 
00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:34.410 align:start position:0%
their supply chain
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
you know just obtaining you know the
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
sanitation mass and sanitizer and things
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
that are needed now and also meat has
 
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
been somewhat scarce to obtain in bulk
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
as well but still they're open and and
 
00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:00.030 align:start position:0%
the community is supporting them so at
 
00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:01.650 align:start position:0%
least you know there's a little bit of a
 
00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:07.130 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
will hope that then it's only gonna take
 
00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
a couple of years to get all of this
 
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:21.570 align:start position:0%
back that we've had before so Wendy and
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
and Tracy thank you very much for coming
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for having us talking - thank
 
00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:31.470 align:start position:0%
you very much and we're going to have to
 
00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:33.290 align:start position:0%
go talk with the insurance department
 
00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:40.470 align:start position:0%
okay okay I can think of a lot more
 
00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:47.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:55.910 align:start position:0%
but they we have in the audience
 
00:45:59.360 --> 00:45:59.370 align:start position:0%
Christopher accomplice on the
 
00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:02.790 align:start position:0%
commissioner and Kristy rice and Norma
 
00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
Stallings who we know pretty well and I
 
00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:11.550 align:start position:0%
think you want to present something to
 
00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:16.470 align:start position:0%
us before we ask questions we got a
 
00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:21.810 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:24.580 align:start position:0%
well I'm presuming that that's me this
 
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:29.140 align:start position:0%
is Norma talking okay thank you thank
 
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:32.740 align:start position:0%
you for having us sure okay well I
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
believe that you all did receive the
 
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:41.530 align:start position:0%
memo that I sent to Kris and it's
 
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:45.070 align:start position:0%
basically the same set up it I usually
 
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:47.530 align:start position:0%
have that page one we're talking about
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
the current fiscal year in what our
 
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:55.330 align:start position:0%
authorized budget was and what we are
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
where we're at now in what we think will
 
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:03.910 align:start position:0%
complete fiscal year 2020 and the chart
 
00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:07.270 align:start position:0%
at the top of the page shows that we're
 
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:10.270 align:start position:0%
expecting approximately eight point
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars in excess of the
 
00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:18.460 align:start position:0%
authorized budget and basically in the
 
00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:21.330 align:start position:0%
next paragraph I break that down it
 
00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:26.710 align:start position:0%
comprises of the premium tax being a
 
00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
favorable variance of 5.8 million plus
 
00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:35.140 align:start position:0%
the transfer to the granite Advantage
 
00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:39.310 align:start position:0%
Health Trust was a million four point
 
00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:42.930 align:start position:0%
five less than what was anticipated and
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
we have a million five in addition to
 
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
the P revenue that is generated by the
 
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
the various licenses and in departments
 
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:05.350 align:start position:0%
in the insurance department and then so
 
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:08.230 align:start position:0%
we can I forget down into each of the
 
00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:12.790 align:start position:0%
components so that you can see what it
 
00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:16.330 align:start position:0%
was that generated this additional eight
 
00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:22.870 align:start position:0%
point eight million on page two that is
 
00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:28.060 align:start position:0%
further detail of how the original
 
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:31.930 align:start position:0%
budget was calculated in
 
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:35.770 align:start position:0%
what we have for actual numbers and
 
00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:38.860 align:start position:0%
again it there wasn't too much of a
 
00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:43.780 align:start position:0%
difference in the tax base from what we
 
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:47.050 align:start position:0%
projected to what the actual laws the
 
00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:49.150 align:start position:0%
line items that made up the biggest
 
00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:55.030 align:start position:0%
difference is the retaliatory tax rate
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
which is the additional taxes that we
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
collect for those insurance companies
 
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:06.910 align:start position:0%
that are domiciled in other states other
 
00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:09.370 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire and I can tell you
 
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:13.450 align:start position:0%
that primarily the states that that
 
00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:16.870 align:start position:0%
makes up or Delaware Massachusetts New
 
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:19.660 align:start position:0%
York Pennsylvania Rhode Island in
 
00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:25.150 align:start position:0%
Vermont they are taxed at two percent so
 
00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:28.030 align:start position:0%
even though their front they're writing
 
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
predominantly Property and Casualty
 
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:32.740 align:start position:0%
which new hampshire charges one and a
 
00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:35.620 align:start position:0%
quarter we still collected at the two
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
percent so that's the we had an
 
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:42.580 align:start position:0%
additional half a million in the that
 
00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:46.230 align:start position:0%
item the next one is the retaliatory
 
00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:51.450 align:start position:0%
item tax base that's where if a again a
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
company who is domiciled in Delaware
 
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
they charge all their companies a fraud
 
00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:05.650 align:start position:0%
fee of $900 so New Hampshire in turn any
 
00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:08.430 align:start position:0%
of the Delaware companies that are
 
00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:10.570 align:start position:0%
licensed in doing business in New
 
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:14.230 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will collect the $900 from
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
those Delaware companies and there are
 
00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:19.620 align:start position:0%
several states that have these various
 
00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:22.300 align:start position:0%
fees in predominantly
 
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
we collect from the Illinois companies
 
00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:28.540 align:start position:0%
because they Illinois's well they have a
 
00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:32.740 align:start position:0%
low premium tax rate they have an income
 
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:37.330 align:start position:0%
tax rate that they charge all insurance
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
companies and the other state that we
 
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:42.210 align:start position:0%
collect from is Massachusetts
 
00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:45.430 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has a number of assessment
 
00:50:49.849 --> 00:50:49.859 align:start position:0%
in additional fees that are collected
 
00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:53.290 align:start position:0%
from any of the companies doing business
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts so that we ended up
 
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:00.730 align:start position:0%
with approximately million dollars more
 
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:05.410 align:start position:0%
than what was anticipated I mean when we
 
00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:09.460 align:start position:0%
calculated the original budget excuse me
 
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
isn't this this is business people or
 
00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:17.020 align:start position:0%
businesses that are getting insurance
 
00:51:20.339 --> 00:51:20.349 align:start position:0%
hear from a Massachusetts or Delaware or
 
00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:25.780 align:start position:0%
an Illinois company no these are all
 
00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
insurance companies Oh insurance
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
companies are licensed in New Hampshire
 
00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:37.170 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm there are they're domiciled in
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
state other states but they're licensed
 
00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:46.839 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so any company that is
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
for instance licensed in Massachusetts
 
00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:53.290 align:start position:0%
doing business in New Hampshire they
 
00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:57.670 align:start position:0%
will pay to New Hampshire those fees in
 
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:01.450 align:start position:0%
tax rates that Massachusetts is charging
 
00:52:07.339 --> 00:52:07.349 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.799 --> 00:52:10.809 align:start position:0%
so it's simply the insurance companies
 
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:15.130 align:start position:0%
but the differences come from where the
 
00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:22.569 align:start position:0%
company is domiciled but it is a New
 
00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:26.230 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based company which is getting
 
00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:28.390 align:start position:0%
insurance from an out-of-state place
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
that has higher rates for some reason
 
00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
it's a New Hampshire resident that is
 
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:41.910 align:start position:0%
buying a policy from a company that is
 
00:52:44.789 --> 00:52:44.799 align:start position:0%
domiciled in another state of New
 
00:52:51.079 --> 00:52:51.089 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes thank you okay and then
 
00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:53.500 align:start position:0%
the rep some major has a question
 
00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:58.810 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:02.670 align:start position:0%
relative to the corporate situation
 
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:06.130 align:start position:0%
have you made any changes to the
 
00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
revenues especially yes yes we have that
 
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
is on page three that we have our
 
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:25.270 align:start position:0%
revised estimate for fiscal year twenty
 
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:29.740 align:start position:0%
twenty one twenty fiscal year twenty
 
00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:36.700 align:start position:0%
twenty is not impacted by the pandemic
 
00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:41.310 align:start position:0%
because that revenue is primarily
 
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:46.300 align:start position:0%
calculated on calendar year 2019 premium
 
00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:49.770 align:start position:0%
written taxes are collected in March
 
00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:54.790 align:start position:0%
2020 but the premiums were collected
 
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:05.140 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 okay so if we want to go on
 
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:10.150 align:start position:0%
to fiscal year 2021 we originally had an
 
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:16.390 align:start position:0%
estimate of 130 million 0.9 and we are
 
00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:19.420 align:start position:0%
adjusting it downward to one hundred and
 
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:24.490 align:start position:0%
twenty eight point two million the areas
 
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
that we felt were going to show the
 
00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
decrease is the property and casualty
 
00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
line of business and also the
 
00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:42.220 align:start position:0%
marketplace health premium we anticipate
 
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:47.380 align:start position:0%
that that because of the unemployment
 
00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:51.610 align:start position:0%
and other factors of the health
 
00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:53.410 align:start position:0%
insurance that that would go down as
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
well okay in on page three there's a
 
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:06.490 align:start position:0%
little narrative about some of the
 
00:55:11.849 --> 00:55:11.859 align:start position:0%
factors that were considered in the
 
00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:15.710 align:start position:0%
from our actuaries when they looked at
 
00:55:19.859 --> 00:55:19.869 align:start position:0%
what the impact of the Cova nineteen
 
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:23.570 align:start position:0%
would have neighbor son I was on page
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
four by mistake okay page four is the
 
00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:33.770 align:start position:0%
detail of and again that that shows the
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
individual line items that in more
 
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:41.710 align:start position:0%
detail of what we have but conversely
 
00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:46.250 align:start position:0%
what we have here is that well we
 
00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:49.730 align:start position:0%
decreased what I anticipated growth
 
00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:54.020 align:start position:0%
rates were going to be we have had a
 
00:55:57.359 --> 00:55:57.369 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent up turn to the
 
00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:01.190 align:start position:0%
unlicensed companies those the surplus
 
00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:03.609 align:start position:0%
lines or excess lines of business and
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
basically I increased what we
 
00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
anticipated for that tax line based on
 
00:56:15.099 --> 00:56:15.109 align:start position:0%
what the three-year average had been in
 
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
the same thing for license fees and
 
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:22.310 align:start position:0%
penalties the average for the last three
 
00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:25.670 align:start position:0%
years has been closer to the eighteen
 
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:32.330 align:start position:0%
million so while we have a decrease in
 
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:35.450 align:start position:0%
what we anticipate for the license
 
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:39.650 align:start position:0%
companies premium taxes we have somewhat
 
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:42.980 align:start position:0%
of an offset of it of approximately two
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
million that are in the other two line
 
00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
items so I don't see the reduction in
 
00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:02.450 align:start position:0%
property and casualty in the detail okay
 
00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
on page four the first line item is the
 
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
property and casualty the original
 
00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:21.020 align:start position:0%
budget was two million five hundred and
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
forty three million and we've
 
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:30.170 align:start position:0%
crease that down to two billion 528
 
00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
million yeah so that's where you're
 
00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:36.870 align:start position:0%
going to get the definer adjustments
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
that were made in the calculations and
 
00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
then a little bit further down you can
 
00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:48.380 align:start position:0%
see the decrease in the medical
 
00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:53.190 align:start position:0%
line-item net of the federal employee
 
00:57:59.690 --> 00:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
program in Medicare Part D in Medicare
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
Advantage so that originally was
 
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
projected to have a premium growth of
 
00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:09.570 align:start position:0%
2.5 million and we adjusted that
 
00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
don't we also have the effect of the
 
00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:34.100 align:start position:0%
tails that we would owe if we gave up
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
getting the tax instead of having the
 
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:42.530 align:start position:0%
entire year's tax paid up front and then
 
00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:47.220 align:start position:0%
when we have a lower tax the next year
 
00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
we have to we lose double and when we
 
00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:51.810 align:start position:0%
have a higher text the next year we gain
 
00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:55.050 align:start position:0%
double right you're talking about the
 
00:58:57.830 --> 00:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
deferred revenue you know and if in the
 
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
past I believe that you all have used
 
00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:06.750 align:start position:0%
the cash basis because that is what is
 
00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
we have government operates is based on
 
00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:12.630 align:start position:0%
a cash basis it's only at the end of the
 
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
fiscal year that there's an accounting
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
entry to account for that
 
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
prepayment that we collect in March that
 
00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:29.180 align:start position:0%
actually applies for the time period of
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
July 1st to December 31st
 
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
adjust downward when we have less
 
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
premium what'll end up actually
 
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:46.110 align:start position:0%
happening is that there'll be an
 
00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
adjustment to increase the premium take
 
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
taking out the amount of money out of
 
00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:58.290 align:start position:0%
that deferred revenue account but I
 
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:01.050 align:start position:0%
don't think that my estimate would be
 
01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
that that may be half a million dollars
 
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:07.590 align:start position:0%
there there would be an additional half
 
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:09.990 align:start position:0%
a million dollars from the deferred
 
01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:15.450 align:start position:0%
revenue for fiscal year 2021 it's not
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's not huge I think one time we ended
 
01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:37.710 align:start position:0%
the amount of the auto insurance
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
companies have been giving rebates is
 
01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:41.370 align:start position:0%
that in consequential in terms of this
 
01:00:45.790 --> 01:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
discussion some considerations about
 
01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:53.030 align:start position:0%
consequential yes we did have the
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
property and casualty actuary look at
 
01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:01.350 align:start position:0%
that and he did say that these paybacks
 
01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:04.610 align:start position:0%
were going to have a small impact on
 
01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:10.470 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2020 it's a combination of
 
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:12.990 align:start position:0%
how they're paying it back whether they
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
treat it as a dividend and pay it back
 
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
this year or whether they're giving them
 
01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:21.930 align:start position:0%
immediate credit for the next payment
 
01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:25.230 align:start position:0%
that they did have do or they're
 
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
actually cutting them a checks is number
 
01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:30.750 align:start position:0%
of variances I can tell you personally I
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
have three cars in I got twenty three
 
01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:36.930 align:start position:0%
dollars back from the insurance company
 
01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm not thinking it is it's going to
 
01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
be a big amount of money that they are
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
going to be refunding and crediting and
 
01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:48.330 align:start position:0%
just to follow up with what Norma said
 
01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
there this is Krishna o'clock was the
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioner I think
 
01:01:54.099 --> 01:01:54.109 align:start position:0%
worst-case scenario estimate was about
 
01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:15.150 align:start position:0%
$380,000 so inconsequential if you
 
01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:18.690 align:start position:0%
looked at what happened to these lines
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
during the Great Recession there does be
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
a history of a hardening of the market
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
but again the insurance industry in
 
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
itself it lags behind
 
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
traditionally all of the other
 
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
industries in the from what I've read it
 
01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:46.710 align:start position:0%
would be first the commercial lines of
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
business the errors and omission
 
01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:56.550 align:start position:0%
policies they would start getting more
 
01:02:59.950 --> 01:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
expensive and the other part is that
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
when an insurance company they there are
 
01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:07.890 align:start position:0%
reinsurance companies the reinsurance
 
01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
companies are the traditional insurance
 
01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
companies insurers so if they have a
 
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:20.310 align:start position:0%
block of business that they no longer
 
01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:24.500 align:start position:0%
wish to retain the risk for they will
 
01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:27.750 align:start position:0%
sign a reinsurance agreement with
 
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
another company and what I have read it
 
01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
hasn't indicated that the reinsurance
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
companies they are going to also it's
 
01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:40.670 align:start position:0%
going to become more expensive for the
 
01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to acquire that
 
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
reinsurance so that but again that's not
 
01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:54.690 align:start position:0%
in the near future in in New Hampshire
 
01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:00.500 align:start position:0%
it has not had a enormous amount of
 
01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:04.340 align:start position:0%
impact but again we're we're really
 
01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.780 align:start position:0%
impact but again we're we're really
uncharted

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:05.790 align:start position:0%
uncharted
 
01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:10.970 align:start position:0%
territory right now so if in fact the
 
01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
perception is that a industries
 
01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:19.710 align:start position:0%
businesses feel the need to have more
 
01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:27.390 align:start position:0%
coverage it will cost more money so what
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that that if we do get
 
01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:34.170 align:start position:0%
an impact from this and the market gets
 
01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:36.270 align:start position:0%
harder it's not really going to show up
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
for a few years correct because right
 
01:04:44.359 --> 01:04:44.369 align:start position:0%
now fiscal year 2021 is based on what's
 
01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:46.050 align:start position:0%
happening right now it's based on
 
01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:48.810 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2020 mm-hmm
 
01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:55.170 align:start position:0%
so it won't be until the policies that
 
01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:57.830 align:start position:0%
are currently in place start to renew
 
01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
and that I would expect would be in
 
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2021 so it definitely well
 
01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't say anything nothing is
 
01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:15.030 align:start position:0%
definite right now but I am confident
 
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
that it will take more than the near
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
future few months to have a significant
 
01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:27.990 align:start position:0%
impact so it looks like if it happens it
 
01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
would affect the next budget that
 
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:36.510 align:start position:0%
definitely by then your your national
 
01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:40.410 align:start position:0%
level consultants that that work on
 
01:05:43.099 --> 01:05:43.109 align:start position:0%
these things also have a better idea of
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
what's going on correct and we've the
 
01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
actuaries they would see whatever the
 
01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
rate requests are and they would have a
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
better idea of what is going to happen
 
01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:02.910 align:start position:0%
as well thank you are there any further
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:25.270 align:start position:0%
and next we go to lottery is Charlie in
 
01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:30.580 align:start position:0%
the audience or someone representing him
 
01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:36.150 align:start position:0%
oh we're gonna min right now here he is
 
01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:38.380 align:start position:0%
madam chair good afternoon
 
01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:39.940 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre for the lottery good
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee good
 
01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:53.710 align:start position:0%
afternoon this is the shortest document
 
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
you've ever given us I think the resume
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean certainly if I could I can
 
01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:07.030 align:start position:0%
go through where our data suggests we
 
01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
are it'll take about two minutes answer
 
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:13.090 align:start position:0%
questions I can only submit to you that
 
01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:16.470 align:start position:0%
I worry about making estimates based on
 
01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:19.750 align:start position:0%
never-before-seen data certainly my
 
01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:23.260 align:start position:0%
experience in Lottery going back 17
 
01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:28.030 align:start position:0%
years so I'll briefly go into it so draw
 
01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:30.370 align:start position:0%
game sales are down tremendously that's
 
01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
led by a Powerball Mega Millions which
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
are off collectively for the year forty
 
01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
percent which is twenty-six million
 
01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:41.140 align:start position:0%
dollars in sales that's a combination of
 
01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:44.050 align:start position:0%
a lack of jackpots as well as a severe
 
01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:46.900 align:start position:0%
drop in the bond factor which is what we
 
01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:49.570 align:start position:0%
use to multiply the cash available to
 
01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
advertise a jackpot
 
01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:53.290 align:start position:0%
that being said both mega moons and
 
01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:56.140 align:start position:0%
Powerball have rolling jackpots which if
 
01:07:59.000 --> 01:07:59.010 align:start position:0%
they continue will increase revenues
 
01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:03.310 align:start position:0%
keno year-over-year is up 12% meaning
 
01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:05.890 align:start position:0%
the to this point this year versus to
 
01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:09.220 align:start position:0%
the prior point last year but currently
 
01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:11.050 align:start position:0%
when you compare the week's meaning
 
01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:14.140 align:start position:0%
right now versus a year ago it's off 85
 
01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:17.020 align:start position:0%
percent I'll say that's down because of
 
01:08:19.770 --> 01:08:19.780 align:start position:0%
bars and taverns not being open and if
 
01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:21.130 align:start position:0%
they are open they're open for take-out
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
only so folks are playing while they're
 
01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:25.710 align:start position:0%
waiting for their food is that short
 
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
sports betting is off 70% this is
 
01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:31.870 align:start position:0%
harder to quantify it we've uh little
 
01:08:36.329 --> 01:08:36.339 align:start position:0%
bit up launched for five months but we
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
have seen a somewhat of a growth with
 
01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:43.150 align:start position:0%
some sports coming back online we get a
 
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:45.220 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of business in the
 
01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:47.500 align:start position:0%
golf match between Tiger Woods and Phil
 
01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:50.980 align:start position:0%
Mickelson on Saturday with Tom Brady and
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
Peyton Manning we also with the launch
 
01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:56.380 align:start position:0%
of the Bundesliga which is the European
 
01:08:59.250 --> 01:08:59.260 align:start position:0%
soccer league has seen the launch a
 
01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
growth as well so would have been off
 
01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:05.260 align:start position:0%
about 85% is off 70% charitable gambling
 
01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:09.910 align:start position:0%
is off 100% that yields a loss of about
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
a million dollars a month for charities
 
01:09:13.530 --> 01:09:13.540 align:start position:0%
as well as a quarter million dollars for
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
the state monthly internet lottery is up
 
01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
significantly as you can imagine folks
 
01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:22.630 align:start position:0%
now can play from their homes so they
 
01:09:26.039 --> 01:09:26.049 align:start position:0%
will and what is the most puzzling to us
 
01:09:29.099 --> 01:09:29.109 align:start position:0%
is scratch ticket sales which had been
 
01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:31.750 align:start position:0%
off 15% during the trough of the kovin
 
01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:34.150 align:start position:0%
are now running at a rate consistent
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
with Christmas we have done two weeks
 
01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:39.670 align:start position:0%
back-to-back of six million dollars in
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
sales which is more than we did the
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
Christmas season so in the past week our
 
01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:51.850 align:start position:0%
sales are up 23% which is tremendously
 
01:09:55.530 --> 01:09:55.540 align:start position:0%
from adjectives on this tremendously
 
01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
anomalous and that doesn't compare with
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
our neighbors Massachusetts of the same
 
01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:05.650 align:start position:0%
period is down 2% Maine is up 7 and
 
01:10:08.610 --> 01:10:08.620 align:start position:0%
Vermont is up 11 so we're up double
 
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
versus what would be a nearest
 
01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:13.930 align:start position:0%
comparator and nor is it statewide in
 
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
some regions were off significantly and
 
01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:18.610 align:start position:0%
some regions were up significantly and
 
01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:22.090 align:start position:0%
so I hate to sort of call it a trend
 
01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:23.830 align:start position:0%
it's only two weeks and it's not
 
01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:28.030 align:start position:0%
statewide and so if that trend were to
 
01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:30.730 align:start position:0%
continue certainly we that coupled with
 
01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:33.310 align:start position:0%
new sports coming online we would run
 
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:36.730 align:start position:0%
raise estimates currently I believe we
 
01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:38.830 align:start position:0%
provided guidance of 95 million for this
 
01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:40.450 align:start position:0%
year and a hundred million for next year
 
01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:42.700 align:start position:0%
it is likely in the next week and a half
 
01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
two weeks we would
 
01:10:46.489 --> 01:10:46.499 align:start position:0%
this year's fiscal estimate
 
01:10:51.629 --> 01:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
significantly and certainly with my very
 
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:54.130 align:start position:0%
brief notes to you madam chair
 
01:10:57.839 --> 01:10:57.849 align:start position:0%
those are our the variables we have in
 
01:10:59.520 --> 01:10:59.530 align:start position:0%
play right now in terms of the revenues
 
01:11:01.819 --> 01:11:01.829 align:start position:0%
for this fiscal year next to school year
 
01:11:04.379 --> 01:11:04.389 align:start position:0%
and happy to answer any questions you
 
01:11:04.739 --> 01:11:04.749 align:start position:0%
may have
 
01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:11.710 align:start position:0%
about anything thank you I was trying to
 
01:11:14.759 --> 01:11:14.769 align:start position:0%
find your actual estimates which are in
 
01:11:17.819 --> 01:11:17.829 align:start position:0%
the sheet that that cuz she gave us that
 
01:11:22.259 --> 01:11:22.269 align:start position:0%
I hadn't been looking at so far would
 
01:11:25.859 --> 01:11:25.869 align:start position:0%
you mind repeating what you thought you
 
01:11:29.969 --> 01:11:29.979 align:start position:0%
might you currently have 95 million for
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
this year yes yes
 
01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:40.030 align:start position:0%
so that's supported by 5 million from
 
01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:41.860 align:start position:0%
last year that was transferred into this
 
01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:43.900 align:start position:0%
year for a couple of reasons one is and
 
01:11:45.839 --> 01:11:45.849 align:start position:0%
as you know we trained through at the
 
01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:48.190 align:start position:0%
end of June for June sales before they
 
01:11:50.069 --> 01:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
happened so easily are conservative with
 
01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:52.690 align:start position:0%
that transfer and then also there was an
 
01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:55.510 align:start position:0%
adjustment by the LBA auditors for a
 
01:11:58.350 --> 01:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
retirement which yielded a positive 3
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
million dollar amount so of the 95 5
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
million of that is from last year to
 
01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:10.710 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.989 --> 01:12:12.999 align:start position:0%
believe our estimate for the year for
 
01:12:14.399 --> 01:12:14.409 align:start position:0%
the budget was a hundred million hundred
 
01:12:19.049 --> 01:12:19.059 align:start position:0%
million point four I believe yes so I
 
01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:23.530 align:start position:0%
would I'm sorry but I'm just next so
 
01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:24.940 align:start position:0%
it's like the next ten days if the
 
01:12:26.879 --> 01:12:26.889 align:start position:0%
trends continue because I do hate
 
01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:28.420 align:start position:0%
calling a trend after just a couple of
 
01:12:30.899 --> 01:12:30.909 align:start position:0%
weeks I would anticipate us raising
 
01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:34.170 align:start position:0%
guidance in the next week or two weeks
 
01:12:39.779 --> 01:12:39.789 align:start position:0%
and you could raise it how much do you
 
01:12:41.339 --> 01:12:41.349 align:start position:0%
think you might regice it if they
 
01:12:44.969 --> 01:12:44.979 align:start position:0%
continue symmetry 3.5 million so we
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
between 1798 one hundred million dollars
 
01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:50.770 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
if the trends continue and Mega Millions
 
01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:57.550 align:start position:0%
rolls again which it has been for now 18
 
01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:14.550 align:start position:0%
weeks okay so then all of next year's
 
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:18.970 align:start position:0%
you think will be be it a hundred
 
01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:22.180 align:start position:0%
million which is what we were expecting
 
01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:25.770 align:start position:0%
for this year before all this happened
 
01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:28.660 align:start position:0%
so you think it's still gonna take a
 
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
while to get back what you were looking
 
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:38.590 align:start position:0%
at before yes I mean certainly I was
 
01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:40.540 align:start position:0%
somewhere like I said we made the
 
01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:42.580 align:start position:0%
estimates and did the work before we saw
 
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:45.910 align:start position:0%
what was a significant growth in scratch
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
ticket sales and like no time and our my
 
01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:51.790 align:start position:0%
history certainly with the lottery and
 
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:54.190 align:start position:0%
the folks that work with is it harder to
 
01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:58.150 align:start position:0%
estimate retail behavior but by players
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
of a discretionary product only because
 
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
the we saw the bottom and the top
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
happened within a month of each other in
 
01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:11.740 align:start position:0%
my history of lottery sales which is not
 
01:14:13.890 --> 01:14:13.900 align:start position:0%
common and so it's hard to sort of plan
 
01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
out for the next year when it's been
 
01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:20.350 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the last six weeks but
 
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:22.090 align:start position:0%
hopefully by next year they'll have
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
figured out sports betting again I hope
 
01:14:29.010 --> 01:14:29.020 align:start position:0%
I hope honestly a large portion of our
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
sports betting estimates for a full year
 
01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
relate to a physical location being open
 
01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:37.270 align:start position:0%
and smoothly distancing within a
 
01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
physical location will be obviously
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
tricky but in a weird sense they're
 
01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:46.180 align:start position:0%
actually benefits by having real sports
 
01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:48.460 align:start position:0%
or major sports up and running with no
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
fans because folks want to have the fan
 
01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:53.590 align:start position:0%
like environment and they can't do it at
 
01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:56.110 align:start position:0%
the facility as in the stadium they
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
would they will do it at a physical
 
01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:01.850 align:start position:0%
sports book location if that makes sense
 
01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:04.250 align:start position:0%
I'll be opening the physical sparse
 
01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:06.740 align:start position:0%
locations not yet no they're not open
 
01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:08.570 align:start position:0%
but they're slated to open as soon as
 
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:09.170 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:12.650 align:start position:0%
one in Seabrook was ready to open five
 
01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:15.170 align:start position:0%
days before we in March before we closed
 
01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:16.790 align:start position:0%
everything now we're close to the bars
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
and taverns down and they closed down in
 
01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:26.930 align:start position:0%
in lockstep with those how much of this
 
01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:30.710 align:start position:0%
of these scratch tickets comes from from
 
01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:33.530 align:start position:0%
convenience stores first as far as in
 
01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:36.020 align:start position:0%
taverns crash ticket sales
 
01:15:40.810 --> 01:15:40.820 align:start position:0%
oh it's 98 percent 97 percent the
 
01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:42.530 align:start position:0%
greatest loss in scratch ticket sales
 
01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:44.420 align:start position:0%
has been the stores that no longer carry
 
01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:53.570 align:start position:0%
temporarily some closed permanently the
 
01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:55.250 align:start position:0%
Market Basket chain has stopped selling
 
01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:58.370 align:start position:0%
lottery tickets during this period so
 
01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:01.100 align:start position:0%
we've seen a loss in sales in their.what
 
01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:03.590 align:start position:0%
bars and taverns is is negligible in
 
01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:05.030 align:start position:0%
terms of what they sell for Sky's
 
01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:08.780 align:start position:0%
tickets the scratch tickets to that
 
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:11.510 align:start position:0%
point madam chair scratch ticket is our
 
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:13.610 align:start position:0%
number-one revenue source for the state
 
01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:15.290 align:start position:0%
it's represents more than half of our
 
01:16:18.139 --> 01:16:18.149 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
Yeah right so some of the stores have
 
01:16:26.429 --> 01:16:26.439 align:start position:0%
closed completely and the numbers of
 
01:16:28.649 --> 01:16:28.659 align:start position:0%
just discontinued it for now
 
01:16:31.649 --> 01:16:31.659 align:start position:0%
correct correct they don't like the
 
01:16:33.449 --> 01:16:33.459 align:start position:0%
transfer the clothes transfer of the
 
01:16:38.509 --> 01:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
transaction and happening review and
 
01:16:41.759 --> 01:16:41.769 align:start position:0%
some like a Hannaford's only sell
 
01:16:44.279 --> 01:16:44.289 align:start position:0%
through the machine the terminal that
 
01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:46.570 align:start position:0%
says you want and they don't sell the
 
01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
customer service anymore now right and
 
01:17:04.649 --> 01:17:04.659 align:start position:0%
Market Basket it's just not not selling
 
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:17:09.810 --> 01:17:09.820 align:start position:0%
they're not sewing at all correct as you
 
01:17:11.549 --> 01:17:11.559 align:start position:0%
can imagine Market Basket is one of our
 
01:17:12.599 --> 01:17:12.609 align:start position:0%
larger chains
 
01:17:20.879 --> 01:17:20.889 align:start position:0%
yes stores okay we've got three
 
01:17:22.979 --> 01:17:22.989 align:start position:0%
questions now well I was waiting but
 
01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:26.619 align:start position:0%
I've said a major thank you I was
 
01:17:30.569 --> 01:17:30.579 align:start position:0%
looking the official plan for 2020 it
 
01:17:35.729 --> 01:17:35.739 align:start position:0%
was a hundred point floor so whoever's
 
01:17:38.849 --> 01:17:38.859 align:start position:0%
estimate of 95 will be down five point
 
01:17:43.969 --> 01:17:43.979 align:start position:0%
four for 2020 and the official plan for
 
01:17:48.359 --> 01:17:48.369 align:start position:0%
2021 is a hundred and ten point four and
 
01:17:51.629 --> 01:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
some Charley's estimate weed out 10
 
01:17:54.779 --> 01:17:54.789 align:start position:0%
million dogs that's correct
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
represent a major and those are what I
 
01:17:58.259 --> 01:17:58.269 align:start position:0%
would characterize is conservative
 
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:06.010 align:start position:0%
estimates okay okay mm-hmm yeah there's
 
01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:08.530 align:start position:0%
the scratch ticket issue and there's
 
01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:13.300 align:start position:0%
sports betting opening up further yes
 
01:18:15.449 --> 01:18:15.459 align:start position:0%
the ten million dollar increase for 2021
 
01:18:18.089 --> 01:18:18.099 align:start position:0%
is actually basically scratched sports
 
01:18:22.109 --> 01:18:22.119 align:start position:0%
betting launching as a as a product line
 
01:18:23.729 --> 01:18:23.739 align:start position:0%
and making ten million dollars profit
 
01:18:26.359 --> 01:18:26.369 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:40.300 align:start position:0%
okay so the next question is represent
 
01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:41.790 align:start position:0%
over bra me
 
01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just curious Charlie how about
 
01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:47.370 align:start position:0%
Tara or gaming I know it's a small
 
01:18:51.450 --> 01:18:51.460 align:start position:0%
there's no extensive while revenue but
 
01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:52.390 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that they are
 
01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
conversations going on about opening
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
them what are you hearing certainly I
 
01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:01.330 align:start position:0%
know that members of the charitable
 
01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:04.660 align:start position:0%
gaming operators and charities appeared
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
before the reopening Commission and made
 
01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:10.930 align:start position:0%
their case about how they can do it as a
 
01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
as a prot as a center for profit for the
 
01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
state it's not really a profitable
 
01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:16.870 align:start position:0%
enterprise we make about two and a half
 
01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
three million dollars it covers
 
01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:20.610 align:start position:0%
essentially the cost of regulating them
 
01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:22.900 align:start position:0%
but I do know the charitable community
 
01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:25.690 align:start position:0%
has been very vocal about how much money
 
01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:27.820 align:start position:0%
they're losing because they all all
 
01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:29.470 align:start position:0%
these dates were scheduled as you can
 
01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:31.630 align:start position:0%
imagine all these March states April
 
01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:33.070 align:start position:0%
dates and made dates and now the
 
01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:35.890 align:start position:0%
charities that have had dates are gone
 
01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:39.910 align:start position:0%
and so they're losing I said a little
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars a month in just
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
direct revenue to charities so I know
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
they're clamoring to reopen again since
 
01:19:54.810 --> 01:19:54.820 align:start position:0%
both places see but a big an example you
 
01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:58.570 align:start position:0%
used is it would it be true that the it
 
01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:00.250 align:start position:0%
would all happen all at once
 
01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:01.930 align:start position:0%
if they know if their channel gaming is
 
01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:04.750 align:start position:0%
not open in sports because an open
 
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:07.090 align:start position:0%
always separate issues I mean there's
 
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:09.190 align:start position:0%
separate facilities there actually in
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
case of Seabrook they're in different
 
01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:13.990 align:start position:0%
sections of Seabrook and mousey I know
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
you know that facility pretty well yeah
 
01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:19.150 align:start position:0%
and it hasn't been determined certainly
 
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:21.490 align:start position:0%
it's in pencil not panas to when they
 
01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:23.710 align:start position:0%
open they were ready to go
 
01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:26.530 align:start position:0%
in March like they the equipment's in
 
01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:28.390 align:start position:0%
place the wirings in place the
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
televisions had been mounted the trading
 
01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:34.750 align:start position:0%
platform was built already so it's quite
 
01:20:37.719 --> 01:20:37.729 align:start position:0%
little your switch for us
 
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
some of the other locations also
 
01:20:42.469 --> 01:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
terrible gaming locations yes the second
 
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
location is going to be the Manchester
 
01:20:46.549 --> 01:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
and they all saw our charitable gambling
 
01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:49.050 align:start position:0%
hall one of the benefits to charitable
 
01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:52.130 align:start position:0%
gambling facilities doing this is that
 
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
they have most of the operations in
 
01:20:56.899 --> 01:20:56.909 align:start position:0%
place most of eternal controls in place
 
01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:00.659 align:start position:0%
they have surveillance in place and they
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
have what we found out to be through our
 
01:21:07.879 --> 01:21:07.889 align:start position:0%
research very much more likely folks
 
01:21:09.919 --> 01:21:09.929 align:start position:0%
interested in sports betting because if
 
01:21:11.779 --> 01:21:11.789 align:start position:0%
you like to play you know cards you like
 
01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:13.530 align:start position:0%
to bet on sports to a much much higher
 
01:21:16.339 --> 01:21:16.349 align:start position:0%
degree so the Manchester facility I
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:30.329 align:start position:0%
say because a lot of elbow room be tied
 
01:21:31.939 --> 01:21:31.949 align:start position:0%
to chair or gaming opening at the same
 
01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
time I would think so I mean I thought
 
01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
they would think so yes okay that's one
 
01:21:39.439 --> 01:21:39.449 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and also the partners
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
that are chosen are chosen by draftkings
 
01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
based on a number of factors that we
 
01:21:46.399 --> 01:21:46.409 align:start position:0%
then approved it's not our choice it's
 
01:21:50.089 --> 01:21:50.099 align:start position:0%
draftkings this looks for maximum
 
01:21:52.069 --> 01:21:52.079 align:start position:0%
utilization of what would be a player
 
01:21:54.199 --> 01:21:54.209 align:start position:0%
base as well as the courts with their
 
01:22:02.029 --> 01:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
brand standards as it were so how many
 
01:22:05.839 --> 01:22:05.849 align:start position:0%
more places get to get chosen
 
01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
they'll be recurring one at a time
 
01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:11.090 align:start position:0%
obviously that process was slowed
 
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
dramatically by this whole affair and
 
01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
obviously it has to be in a town or city
 
01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:25.110 align:start position:0%
that approved so numbers three and four
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
are very much in pencil one out see we'd
 
01:22:29.029 --> 01:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
like to put up with north country and
 
01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:32.670 align:start position:0%
then one a second or a fourth one on the
 
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
border as well it was our hope that we
 
01:22:40.129 --> 01:22:40.139 align:start position:0%
would have a fourth location identified
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
but we don't yet our third fourth but
 
01:22:45.919 --> 01:22:45.929 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be building them one at a
 
01:22:45.929 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be building them one at a
time

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:46.850 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
where this for the long haul as you can
 
01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:49.220 align:start position:0%
imagine so we don't want to make a
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
mistake on a bill said is next I just
 
01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:02.810 align:start position:0%
going back to the scratch ticket Shelley
 
01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:04.730 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how big of a component of
 
01:23:11.410 --> 01:23:11.420 align:start position:0%
the revenue is component you know not
 
01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:19.610 align:start position:0%
the physical ticket question if I can
 
01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:23.570 align:start position:0%
answer it yes yes I believe what
 
01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:25.900 align:start position:0%
percentage of the scratch tickets is the
 
01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:28.730 align:start position:0%
physical ones versus what percentage are
 
01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:30.410 align:start position:0%
the virtual ones through the internet
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so our profitability this year is
 
01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:34.990 align:start position:0%
yeah so our profitability this year is
about

01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
well estimated about 55 million on
 
01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:41.090 align:start position:0%
scratch tickets 54 56 depending on what
 
01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:43.850 align:start position:0%
happens in the next five six weeks and
 
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
our scratch ticket profitability on the
 
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
internet will be around six so it's a
 
01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:52.450 align:start position:0%
factor of one to ten
 
01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:00.850 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:04.430 align:start position:0%
okay and the next question is analyzed
 
01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:12.530 align:start position:0%
and your need to be there I a little bit
 
01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
more about charitable gaming I'm on a
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
board that has missed its date this year
 
01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:23.270 align:start position:0%
and we had a considerable conversation
 
01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:26.150 align:start position:0%
about that yesterday in a board meeting
 
01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:27.740 align:start position:0%
and a development committee meeting and
 
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
that grew I think from just listening in
 
01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:35.660 align:start position:0%
on that conversation it was the
 
01:24:38.650 --> 01:24:38.660 align:start position:0%
organization itself like in our case is
 
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
very confusing about how to move forward
 
01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:43.230 align:start position:0%
with this on the charitable gaming front
 
01:24:43.230 --> 01:24:45.450 align:start position:0%
with this on the charitable gaming front
[Music]

01:24:45.450 --> 01:24:45.460 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:50.650 align:start position:0%
its III didn't I couldn't offer any real
 
01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:55.250 align:start position:0%
advice on how to proceed I think that
 
01:24:57.379 --> 01:24:57.389 align:start position:0%
revenue for us is gone
 
01:24:59.060 --> 01:24:59.070 align:start position:0%
for the year I don't know how to get
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
back in that list and I am so I have a
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
question about the future of charitable
 
01:25:12.979 --> 01:25:12.989 align:start position:0%
gaming and how effective it's going to
 
01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:15.690 align:start position:0%
be if it's gonna if we can't get things
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
up and running and and to my group just
 
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
say forget about it that's that's an
 
01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:24.379 align:start position:0%
say forget about it that's that's an
observation

01:25:24.379 --> 01:25:24.389 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:29.670 align:start position:0%
question or a comment or I mean it's
 
01:25:31.850 --> 01:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
just it's been it's been frustrating
 
01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:39.380 align:start position:0%
that's all I guess that was a comment
 
01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:44.070 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Burstein is last I
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
think and he needs to be opened up to
 
01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:53.070 align:start position:0%
thank you uh hi Charlie thanks for
 
01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:53.790 align:start position:0%
coming today
 
01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
course I like your first bullet point
 
01:25:59.780 --> 01:25:59.790 align:start position:0%
regarding the variables it says that no
 
01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:01.710 align:start position:0%
more than 2% of the businesses that
 
01:26:04.399 --> 01:26:04.409 align:start position:0%
carry our products fail and you say
 
01:26:07.390 --> 01:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
businesses is that a synonym for outlets
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
you account Hannaford's as one or as
 
01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:13.530 align:start position:0%
however many establishments they have
 
01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:17.550 align:start position:0%
and why'd you focus on 2% when we read
 
01:26:21.439 --> 01:26:21.449 align:start position:0%
about the I'm reading 20 30 40 % of
 
01:26:23.479 --> 01:26:23.489 align:start position:0%
restaurants are not gonna reopen now I
 
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
know that that's not a hunt that's a
 
01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:26.610 align:start position:0%
subset of the universe that you're
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
citing but 2% I just want you to double
 
01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:31.830 align:start position:0%
click on that number for of course yeah
 
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:36.570 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine we anticipate across
 
01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:37.290 align:start position:0%
the spectrum
 
01:26:39.439 --> 01:26:39.449 align:start position:0%
assemblé will fail at a higher rate
 
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
obviously when you look at the number of
 
01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:44.730 align:start position:0%
bars and taverns we have now it's only
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
about 190 so while a larger portion of
 
01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:51.030 align:start position:0%
bars may fail because of the lack of
 
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
business the vast majority of our
 
01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:56.070 align:start position:0%
current businesses we do business with
 
01:26:58.879 --> 01:26:58.889 align:start position:0%
are considered essential and still up
 
01:27:01.729 --> 01:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
and running so community stores
 
01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:04.530 align:start position:0%
supermarkets - stations like we do 51
 
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
percent of our sales of traditional
 
01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:09.030 align:start position:0%
lottery through C stores with gas so
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're still up and running and still
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
in business
 
01:27:12.729 --> 01:27:12.739 align:start position:0%
and so while they've been affected it
 
01:27:15.610 --> 01:27:15.620 align:start position:0%
hasn't been the same level so that's why
 
01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:17.330 align:start position:0%
I don't anticipate a much higher failure
 
01:27:19.209 --> 01:27:19.219 align:start position:0%
rate and I knock on wood heartily with
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
that statement amongst our retail
 
01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:25.070 align:start position:0%
network see your question representative
 
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
then you would like restaurants we don't
 
01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:29.510 align:start position:0%
count on free for the majority of our
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
revenues we only kind of known for keno
 
01:27:33.459 --> 01:27:33.469 align:start position:0%
which this year was going to net us
 
01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:35.060 align:start position:0%
around six or six to eight million
 
01:27:37.330 --> 01:27:37.340 align:start position:0%
dollars which will be less than that
 
01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:41.630 align:start position:0%
will be probably five to six so we the
 
01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:43.610 align:start position:0%
failure rate amongst them at a higher
 
01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:46.250 align:start position:0%
rate while tragic is not as impactful in
 
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
so keenum is still going on yes it's so
 
01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:00.350 align:start position:0%
we're doing about 150 thousand dollars a
 
01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:03.500 align:start position:0%
week in keno and before the crisis
 
01:28:05.379 --> 01:28:05.389 align:start position:0%
started we had had a few best weeks ever
 
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
when we're doing about eight hundred
 
01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:08.750 align:start position:0%
thousand eight hundred forty thousand a
 
01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:12.530 align:start position:0%
week so it's quite literally folks going
 
01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:15.710 align:start position:0%
to a place that serves food ordering
 
01:28:20.729 --> 01:28:20.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:23.510 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to congregate to play
 
01:28:27.129 --> 01:28:27.139 align:start position:0%
but not to eat it sounds like I was
 
01:28:30.610 --> 01:28:30.620 align:start position:0%
wondering about then yeah I guess I I
 
01:28:32.439 --> 01:28:32.449 align:start position:0%
think they're socially distancing within
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
a closed restaurant for six feet apart
 
01:28:37.450 --> 01:28:37.460 align:start position:0%
buying tickets in you can play a bunch
 
01:28:39.370 --> 01:28:39.380 align:start position:0%
of numbers at once you don't have to buy
 
01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:41.210 align:start position:0%
them one at a time you could play ten
 
01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:43.130 align:start position:0%
and months and wait for ten draws if you
 
01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:45.230 align:start position:0%
were so wish and they think it's a good
 
01:28:46.899 --> 01:28:46.909 align:start position:0%
four years so you could play ten tickets
 
01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:49.730 align:start position:0%
leave immediately and they're good for a
 
01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:57.310 align:start position:0%
year okay any further questions
 
01:29:01.149 --> 01:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
looks like we've we've done that thank
 
01:29:02.729 --> 01:29:02.739 align:start position:0%
you very much charlie
 
01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:05.330 align:start position:0%
thanks a lot bud you know somebody thank
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%

Commission and Tina will run you through

the numbers and let you know where we're
 
01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers and let you know where we're
at

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:45.610 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:49.090 align:start position:0%
good afternoon the document that you
 
01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:52.540 align:start position:0%
have in front of you shows our original
 
01:29:57.330 --> 01:29:57.340 align:start position:0%
plan for liquor of 130 2.8 million we're
 
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:01.810 align:start position:0%
projecting a revised plan of 130 point 1
 
01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:04.870 align:start position:0%
million which is a 2.7 million off that
 
01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
plan that is primarily mainly due to the
 
01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:12.370 align:start position:0%
Hampton properties and not selling the
 
01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:15.750 align:start position:0%
property to be able to pay off our debt
 
01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:18.700 align:start position:0%
so as far as our revenue from liquor
 
01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:22.060 align:start position:0%
sales we're on target for making those
 
01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:26.350 align:start position:0%
projections and looking at the 2021 the
 
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
plan is 130 3.8 million we're revising
 
01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:34.810 align:start position:0%
that to 131 point 1 which could go up if
 
01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:37.180 align:start position:0%
we sell the Hampton properties within
 
01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:41.500 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year so some of those
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
revenues were put in because of the
 
01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:46.090 align:start position:0%
change of selling those properties and
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
paying off those bonds and those
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
properties have not been sold yet the
 
01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:55.390 align:start position:0%
RFP for the realtor's has gone out and
 
01:30:57.930 --> 01:30:57.940 align:start position:0%
we should be making a selection for a
 
01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:02.830 align:start position:0%
realtor soon to have that sale go
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
through but it would go through after
 
01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:19.150 align:start position:0%
Jim that's correct madam chair yes I was
 
01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:21.190 align:start position:0%
just gonna go through the beer tax so
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
the beer tax plan is 13 point 1 million
 
01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:26.830 align:start position:0%
we're revising our estimate to about
 
01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:28.470 align:start position:0%
twelve point eight million which
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
is about $300,000 off the plan and for
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021 the plan was 13 point 1
 
01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:37.830 align:start position:0%
million we've revised the estimate to 12
 
01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:40.350 align:start position:0%
point 9 which is about 200,000 off the
 
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:45.510 align:start position:0%
plan what I wanted to ask about was
 
01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
there's been a 2.7 million change in
 
01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:55.050 align:start position:0%
both each in each year amounting to 5.2
 
01:31:59.090 --> 01:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
total for the biennium and they're both
 
01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:03.570 align:start position:0%
related to the same property or correct
 
01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:06.690 align:start position:0%
correct because what was put in there
 
01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:08.730 align:start position:0%
was selling off the properties at the
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
beginning of this fiscal year and being
 
01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:12.990 align:start position:0%
able to pay down our debt which would
 
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
have decreased our bond payments by that
 
01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:19.950 align:start position:0%
2.7 million in each of the fiscal years
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:30.070 align:start position:0%
2.7 million in each of the fiscal years
[Music]

01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
makes a lot more sense thank you you're
 
01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:40.810 align:start position:0%
makes a lot more sense thank you you're
welcome

01:32:40.810 --> 01:32:40.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:43.410 align:start position:0%
so other than that our plan remains
 
01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:45.630 align:start position:0%
unchanged as to what you see in front of
 
01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
you we hear that liquor is being deluged
 
01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:55.770 align:start position:0%
with customers now well our sales at our
 
01:32:59.480 --> 01:32:59.490 align:start position:0%
at our outlets are up 5.2 percent or
 
01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:03.530 align:start position:0%
nearly 34 million dollars
 
01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:06.810 align:start position:0%
obviously our partners in the restaurant
 
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
world have been distressed greatly by
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
the covin pandemic and we're not seeing
 
01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:18.210 align:start position:0%
or recognizing any sales from them that
 
01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:20.190 align:start position:0%
are significant at this point as they
 
01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:23.430 align:start position:0%
begin to reopen we are seeing some sales
 
01:33:26.630 --> 01:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
come back it's it's not a large amount
 
01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:28.950 align:start position:0%
of money but we're wishing them the best
 
01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:30.630 align:start position:0%
of course they're our partners and
 
01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
they're devastated by this yes what
 
01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:42.250 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:48.020 align:start position:0%
not they not the whole sales know what
 
01:33:49.810 --> 01:33:49.820 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at is are yes our
 
01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:52.730 align:start position:0%
total revenue he was just saving where
 
01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
we're at currently and up until right
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
all the growth all the growth has been
 
01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:04.850 align:start position:0%
in retail madam chair right okay we've
 
01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:06.130 align:start position:0%
got two questions
 
01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative Rami yes thank you
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
um last time we can it was a couple
 
01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:17.170 align:start position:0%
months ago I guess because you couldn't
 
01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:20.330 align:start position:0%
couldn't find step pretty much been
 
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
resolved yes you were doing some kind of
 
01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:26.990 align:start position:0%
a bonus or something upon payment sure
 
01:34:30.490 --> 01:34:30.500 align:start position:0%
the governor in an executive order
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
allowed the Liquor Commission to offer a
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
10% increase hourly increase for our
 
01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
employees in the outlets our sales
 
01:34:44.770 --> 01:34:44.780 align:start position:0%
employees that is still going on to this
 
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:47.810 align:start position:0%
point at one point we had as many as
 
01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:49.910 align:start position:0%
five hundred and sixty-eight employees
 
01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:52.930 align:start position:0%
out of the workplace out of about 1200
 
01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:57.650 align:start position:0%
we had 15 outlets close at this point we
 
01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:01.370 align:start position:0%
still have 14 outlets closed we're
 
01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:05.330 align:start position:0%
reopening three outlets prior to the
 
01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:08.210 align:start position:0%
seventh of June and we have we still
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
have about a hundred and eighty six
 
01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:13.130 align:start position:0%
people out of the workplace both full
 
01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:16.250 align:start position:0%
and part-time and we just did a
 
01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:18.290 align:start position:0%
consolidation of our Franklin and
 
01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:20.150 align:start position:0%
Belmont stores into the new Tilton
 
01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
I was along the same line I was just
 
01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:38.270 align:start position:0%
wondering now what the net impact was of
 
01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
having the approximately 15 stores that
 
01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:44.030 align:start position:0%
were closed and
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
and you know what your your thoughts
 
01:35:51.010 --> 01:35:51.020 align:start position:0%
were you know short of any new new
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic got burst here when you would
 
01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:56.530 align:start position:0%
plan to be be back and fully operational
 
01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:02.630 align:start position:0%
so retail close it Thank You
 
01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:06.250 align:start position:0%
representative closing the outlets and
 
01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:08.810 align:start position:0%
decreasing the hours all the outlets are
 
01:36:14.290 --> 01:36:14.300 align:start position:0%
now open from 11:00 to 6:00 the the
 
01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
impact on sales has not been negative to
 
01:36:20.170 --> 01:36:20.180 align:start position:0%
the contrary the impact on sales has
 
01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
been positive as I've said we're up
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
5.20% or nearly 33.86 million dollars so
 
01:36:33.370 --> 01:36:33.380 align:start position:0%
having those stores closed and reducing
 
01:36:36.670 --> 01:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
the hours in the stores that have had a
 
01:36:39.490 --> 01:36:39.500 align:start position:0%
net positive effect being that the
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants are closed a lot of the
 
01:36:45.729 --> 01:36:45.739 align:start position:0%
restaurants are still closed so our goal
 
01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:47.690 align:start position:0%
in the future is to look for the
 
01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:50.810 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in the reduced hours and in
 
01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:53.030 align:start position:0%
the reduced stores and those are some
 
01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:55.910 align:start position:0%
studies that we're doing now as I've
 
01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:00.050 align:start position:0%
said we've reopened as of as of
 
01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:02.540 align:start position:0%
yesterday we had one store in Milford
 
01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
that was reopened about a week ago we
 
01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:07.070 align:start position:0%
plan on reopening the stores around the
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
lake prior to the seventh and then we'll
 
01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:12.350 align:start position:0%
take the rest of the stores in priority
 
01:37:15.850 --> 01:37:15.860 align:start position:0%
of revenue revenue production as we
 
01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
reopen them there's a string of you had
 
01:37:25.479 --> 01:37:25.489 align:start position:0%
a follow up to the fault based on what
 
01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:26.810 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing you saying part of your
 
01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:29.330 align:start position:0%
long-term plan may be to close five or
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
ten of these stores permanently no no
 
01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:34.510 align:start position:0%
that's not what I'm saying
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that with this stores
 
01:37:40.689 --> 01:37:40.699 align:start position:0%
being closed and our business partners
 
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
in there on the restaurant side what we
 
01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:46.310 align:start position:0%
call our on-premise partners and reduced
 
01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:49.370 align:start position:0%
hours the revenue still rose by nearly
 
01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:53.390 align:start position:0%
thirty four million dollars so what
 
01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:55.540 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do is
 
01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:57.730 align:start position:0%
make sure that when we reopen these
 
01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:00.430 align:start position:0%
stores and when we look at expanding the
 
01:38:02.850 --> 01:38:02.860 align:start position:0%
hours we continue to do it as
 
01:38:05.210 --> 01:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
effectively and efficiently as possible
 
01:38:08.130 --> 01:38:08.140 align:start position:0%
so you may see some of these stores in
 
01:38:11.250 --> 01:38:11.260 align:start position:0%
the future not open as early or stay
 
01:38:13.710 --> 01:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
open as late we're doing a heat graph on
 
01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:16.930 align:start position:0%
where our business is and the hours that
 
01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:20.170 align:start position:0%
were seeing and obviously we're seeing
 
01:38:23.070 --> 01:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
some cross-border traffic back into the
 
01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:26.170 align:start position:0%
state are our stores on the highways the
 
01:38:28.050 --> 01:38:28.060 align:start position:0%
tolls were down by as much as 50 percent
 
01:38:30.570 --> 01:38:30.580 align:start position:0%
at some point and our stores on the
 
01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:33.670 align:start position:0%
highway which are obviously our top two
 
01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:35.730 align:start position:0%
in our top ten stores we're seeing
 
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
revenue loss of as much as 50 percent
 
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:42.010 align:start position:0%
and the in town stores and some of the
 
01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:44.530 align:start position:0%
smaller locations are the stores that
 
01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:46.090 align:start position:0%
are actually doing the increased
 
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:49.510 align:start position:0%
business so we're looking at all the
 
01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:52.300 align:start position:0%
trends that are taking place during the
 
01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:54.790 align:start position:0%
pandemic and transferring that
 
01:38:57.570 --> 01:38:57.580 align:start position:0%
information across as we reopen these
 
01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:00.190 align:start position:0%
stores so we can do it as effectively
 
01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:07.540 align:start position:0%
and efficiently as possible so we do not
 
01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:10.750 align:start position:0%
have I do not have a number of stores
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
that are going to close but I do have is
 
01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:17.260 align:start position:0%
some consolidations in some opening of
 
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:20.830 align:start position:0%
new stores and what I what I do perceive
 
01:39:23.310 --> 01:39:23.320 align:start position:0%
to happen in the future is some reduced
 
01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:27.670 align:start position:0%
hours in some of the outlets but
 
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:30.010 align:start position:0%
obviously the governor is tasked us with
 
01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:32.530 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and we're looking to any
 
01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:34.690 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that we can possibly make
 
01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:36.910 align:start position:0%
to keep our revenues where they need to
 
01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:39.670 align:start position:0%
be and at this point other than that
 
01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:43.900 align:start position:0%
change for the the property that has not
 
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
been sold in Hampton yet we are on
 
01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:52.900 align:start position:0%
target to make our revenue plan right we
 
01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:53.910 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:58.650 align:start position:0%
represented major you had a question yes
 
01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:02.230 align:start position:0%
the sale the property you feel pretty
 
01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:06.030 align:start position:0%
confident and FY 21 of you sold
 
01:40:09.710 --> 01:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
we do we fat we've we had a number of
 
01:40:12.210 --> 01:40:12.220 align:start position:0%
Realtors come to look at the property
 
01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
and we had some very some very positive
 
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
feedback from a lot of the people that
 
01:40:21.210 --> 01:40:21.220 align:start position:0%
are out there obviously we've had a lot
 
01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:24.550 align:start position:0%
of interest over the years since there's
 
01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:27.940 align:start position:0%
been a plan to sell this property and I
 
01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:32.110 align:start position:0%
feel that we will have a sale in 2021
 
01:40:34.590 --> 01:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
and for the amount of money you had
 
01:40:38.370 --> 01:40:38.380 align:start position:0%
anticipated I I feel that that's still a
 
01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:46.890 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:52.290 align:start position:0%
veins yeah thank you thank you
 
01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:55.450 align:start position:0%
so actually two questions the first one
 
01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:57.970 align:start position:0%
is the I don't know what it was called
 
01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:02.050 align:start position:0%
the essential workers payment extra
 
01:41:08.490 --> 01:41:08.500 align:start position:0%
money or um for your bonus for your
 
01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:12.130 align:start position:0%
workers and I believe that comes to an
 
01:41:13.290 --> 01:41:13.300 align:start position:0%
end at some point
 
01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:19.570 align:start position:0%
and what's your plan beyond yes I think
 
01:41:21.090 --> 01:41:21.100 align:start position:0%
I remember that's out of federal money
 
01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:25.650 align:start position:0%
or not out of our state budget directly
 
01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:28.750 align:start position:0%
so this one has one question maybe I
 
01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:32.710 align:start position:0%
should start there well that was a 10%
 
01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:34.570 align:start position:0%
raise representative that was put in
 
01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:37.390 align:start position:0%
place by the governor across the board
 
01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:40.030 align:start position:0%
for any of the frontline workers in our
 
01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:43.210 align:start position:0%
stores you know that has an end date
 
01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:45.670 align:start position:0%
along with with the proclamation put
 
01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
forth but there's not an end date in
 
01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:50.350 align:start position:0%
place at this point and that is money
 
01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:52.930 align:start position:0%
that is state funded that is not
 
01:41:55.650 --> 01:41:55.660 align:start position:0%
federally funded money it's in our
 
01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:57.670 align:start position:0%
revenue estimate I thought that Biser
 
01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:00.550 align:start position:0%
increase in sales it's a small dollar
 
01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:05.830 align:start position:0%
amount that's helpful I didn't know that
 
01:42:10.170 --> 01:42:10.180 align:start position:0%
yes the entire expenses from from the
 
01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission are taken out now
 
01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay and then the other question is
 
01:42:23.209 --> 01:42:23.219 align:start position:0%
quite different it last time you were
 
01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:26.550 align:start position:0%
before us a year ago or so you were
 
01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:31.550 align:start position:0%
telling us about the competition from a
 
01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:34.350 align:start position:0%
very big store or maybe there were a
 
01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:37.950 align:start position:0%
couple of them one of them positioned
 
01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:41.210 align:start position:0%
well positioned in Northeast
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I'm wondering what the
 
01:42:49.130 --> 01:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
story is today on all of that that's
 
01:42:53.150 --> 01:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
total wine and spirits which are they
 
01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:56.250 align:start position:0%
are as as I reported before they are the
 
01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:00.030 align:start position:0%
largest brick-and-mortar beverage
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
alcohol retailer in the United States
 
01:43:05.209 --> 01:43:05.219 align:start position:0%
about a hundred and forty stores in 23
 
01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:09.150 align:start position:0%
states six stores in Massachusetts all
 
01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
east of Northborough so they're all on
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
the inside of the 495 belt they've
 
01:43:19.729 --> 01:43:19.739 align:start position:0%
positioned them obviously in areas that
 
01:43:22.610 --> 01:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
could have presumably affected our
 
01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:26.390 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire they have been
 
01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
impacted significantly by this as well
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
and not only not only in Massachusetts
 
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
you know they remain a constant factor
 
01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:43.290 align:start position:0%
against our marketing and our and our
 
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
management of what we do you know
 
01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:47.610 align:start position:0%
they're they're a constant competitor
 
01:43:52.810 --> 01:43:52.820 align:start position:0%
they've been affected as everyone has so
 
01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:56.150 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that I would say that
 
01:43:58.610 --> 01:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed from from the
 
01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:00.870 align:start position:0%
standpoint of who they are or how they
 
01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
run their business we have effectively
 
01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
managed and market marketed against any
 
01:44:12.110 --> 01:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
type of you know downward trend that the
 
01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:16.110 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission might take given the
 
01:44:19.610 --> 01:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
size of the retailer they've begun in
 
01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:22.290 align:start position:0%
the last six months they typically come
 
01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:24.810 align:start position:0%
in they build a number of stores they
 
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
undercut everybody in the market by 10
 
01:44:28.799 --> 01:44:28.809 align:start position:0%
20 30 %
 
01:44:32.299 --> 01:44:32.309 align:start position:0%
they gain they gain some business mainly
 
01:44:36.419 --> 01:44:36.429 align:start position:0%
private label retailer and they gain
 
01:44:37.979 --> 01:44:37.989 align:start position:0%
some business and then they start to
 
01:44:39.870 --> 01:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
raise their prices and they've they've
 
01:44:41.819 --> 01:44:41.829 align:start position:0%
done that in Massachusetts they follow
 
01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:45.510 align:start position:0%
trend so to this point their prices are
 
01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases actually higher than
 
01:44:52.439 --> 01:44:52.449 align:start position:0%
what we charge and in some cases equal
 
01:44:54.839 --> 01:44:54.849 align:start position:0%
to what we charge so there their
 
01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:57.610 align:start position:0%
effectiveness in marketing against the
 
01:45:00.930 --> 01:45:00.940 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission has you know been
 
01:45:02.970 --> 01:45:02.980 align:start position:0%
nullified at this point they're a
 
01:45:08.569 --> 01:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
good thank you welcome thank you for the
 
01:45:22.649 --> 01:45:22.659 align:start position:0%
question it's gone again yes it's gone
 
01:45:28.919 --> 01:45:28.929 align:start position:0%
again okay now is the curiosity big
 
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
picture question terms of the people who
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
produce all your product if you will is
 
01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
there any supply chain issues
 
01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:46.030 align:start position:0%
no we know at this point we haven't seen
 
01:45:48.689 --> 01:45:48.699 align:start position:0%
any supply chain issues either from the
 
01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:50.710 align:start position:0%
distillery standpoint or the winery
 
01:45:54.450 --> 01:45:54.460 align:start position:0%
standpoint in fact there's been a glut
 
01:45:59.069 --> 01:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
of red wine especially out of California
 
01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:03.130 align:start position:0%
and France so I think we'll be enjoying
 
01:46:06.299 --> 01:46:06.309 align:start position:0%
some great buys over the next few months
 
01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:09.670 align:start position:0%
and obviously next month is our American
 
01:46:12.089 --> 01:46:12.099 align:start position:0%
wine sale so I would I would ask
 
01:46:14.069 --> 01:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
everybody to take a look at the stores
 
01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:16.510 align:start position:0%
if you're an American wine enthusiast
 
01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
and and buy-in thank you okay anybody
 
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
else looks like we've got it thank you
 
01:46:36.839 --> 01:46:36.849 align:start position:0%
very much thank you manicure question
 
01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:46.910 --> 01:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
shei which is as i recall on you take a
 
01:46:54.230 --> 01:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
percentage of the overhead to from the
 
01:46:59.520 --> 01:46:59.530 align:start position:0%
revenues each month to put into to what
 
01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:03.690 align:start position:0%
we get in the monthly revenue focus and
 
01:47:07.890 --> 01:47:07.900 align:start position:0%
did you add in the 10% extra staffing
 
01:47:13.410 --> 01:47:13.420 align:start position:0%
cost so so in the revenue in the revenue
 
01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:14.980 align:start position:0%
focus that's done by administrative
 
01:47:22.290 --> 01:47:22.300 align:start position:0%
services right so all the information
 
01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:24.330 align:start position:0%
comes directly from the liquor
 
01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:29.290 align:start position:0%
administrator the Liquor Commission
 
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
actually estimates each month way what
 
01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:36.310 align:start position:0%
it is and sends it over correct
 
01:47:40.710 --> 01:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
great thank you I thought we trued up at
 
01:47:46.770 --> 01:47:46.780 align:start position:0%
the end of the year thank you very much
 
01:47:51.110 --> 01:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
you kids well thank you safety good
 
01:48:03.690 --> 01:48:03.700 align:start position:0%
afternoon madam chair good afternoon
 
01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:04.630 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:06.490 align:start position:0%
Steve Lavoie director of administration
 
01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:11.830 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Safety so you have
 
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:15.010 align:start position:0%
our our revenue projections what I
 
01:48:16.650 --> 01:48:16.660 align:start position:0%
thought I'd do is just kind of give an
 
01:48:19.530 --> 01:48:19.540 align:start position:0%
overview of some of the assumptions that
 
01:48:21.770 --> 01:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
we've made in arriving at these figures
 
01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:25.510 align:start position:0%
you see the big caveat with all of these
 
01:48:27.930 --> 01:48:27.940 align:start position:0%
amounts is that we've done our best to
 
01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:30.550 align:start position:0%
consider all the available data when
 
01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:32.170 align:start position:0%
developing these projections but
 
01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:35.230 align:start position:0%
everything is is subject to change and
 
01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:37.450 align:start position:0%
we've never experienced this condition
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
before so everybody who's trying to find
 
01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:50.230 align:start position:0%
the right pieces of paper we have a FY
 
01:48:53.429 --> 01:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
22 21 plan versus projected
 
01:48:59.399 --> 01:48:59.409 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety and that one on
 
01:49:04.529 --> 01:49:04.539 align:start position:0%
I guess we don't have to to compare it
 
01:49:06.479 --> 01:49:06.489 align:start position:0%
with the one that's in the worksheet
 
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:09.010 align:start position:0%
that was given to us I apologize
 
01:49:15.509 --> 01:49:15.519 align:start position:0%
at first I couldn't figure it out so go
 
01:49:18.239 --> 01:49:18.249 align:start position:0%
ahead okay thank you
 
01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
so we when we established our
 
01:49:23.729 --> 01:49:23.739 align:start position:0%
projections we made some high-level
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
assumptions we started with looking at
 
01:49:29.489 --> 01:49:29.499 align:start position:0%
the impact on our April revenue
 
01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:33.570 align:start position:0%
collections and and carry that forward
 
01:49:38.339 --> 01:49:38.349 align:start position:0%
the FY 20 and then into FY 21 and we
 
01:49:40.199 --> 01:49:40.209 align:start position:0%
assumed that there'd be a slow and
 
01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:42.519 align:start position:0%
steady recovery throughout the end of
 
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:45.010 align:start position:0%
calendar year 20 into December but that
 
01:49:46.770 --> 01:49:46.780 align:start position:0%
we would still have an overall decline
 
01:49:50.159 --> 01:49:50.169 align:start position:0%
moving forward into January from January
 
01:49:52.799 --> 01:49:52.809 align:start position:0%
into July for the end of FY 21 so high
 
01:49:54.479 --> 01:49:54.489 align:start position:0%
level that's the approach that we took
 
01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
for all of our revenue sources and what
 
01:49:58.620 --> 01:49:58.630 align:start position:0%
I'll do is I'll go through each one
 
01:49:59.939 --> 01:49:59.949 align:start position:0%
individually and provide you with a
 
01:50:02.669 --> 01:50:02.679 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail on on those those
 
01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:05.050 align:start position:0%
specific assumptions so road toll
 
01:50:07.709 --> 01:50:07.719 align:start position:0%
typically with road toll I talked to you
 
01:50:08.879 --> 01:50:08.889 align:start position:0%
about three different factors that
 
01:50:11.129 --> 01:50:11.139 align:start position:0%
impact it the impact fuel consumption
 
01:50:13.739 --> 01:50:13.749 align:start position:0%
and that's price weather and the economy
 
01:50:15.449 --> 01:50:15.459 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes we're really worried
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
about weather and we're really worried
 
01:50:18.899 --> 01:50:18.909 align:start position:0%
about price right now the economic
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
conditions are really putting though
 
01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:25.030 align:start position:0%
that's where the big focus is price is
 
01:50:26.879 --> 01:50:26.889 align:start position:0%
it is it positive right now it's it's
 
01:50:29.969 --> 01:50:29.979 align:start position:0%
extremely low a dollar 96 for a gallon
 
01:50:32.939 --> 01:50:32.949 align:start position:0%
of gasoline it's expected to stay low
 
01:50:34.679 --> 01:50:34.689 align:start position:0%
based on US Energy Information
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
Administration estimates only seek only
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
reaching two dollars by the end of FY
 
01:50:44.370 --> 01:50:44.380 align:start position:0%
2008 Allender year twenty and then two
 
01:50:46.439 --> 01:50:46.449 align:start position:0%
dollars seventeen cents by calendar year
 
01:50:49.469 --> 01:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
21 but even though it's low and even
 
01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:51.130 align:start position:0%
though the weather's good especially
 
01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:53.590 align:start position:0%
good right now the economic impact that
 
01:50:55.919 --> 01:50:55.929 align:start position:0%
COBIT has had is is keeping people off
 
01:50:58.890 --> 01:50:58.900 align:start position:0%
of the roads and so that's really having
 
01:51:00.509 --> 01:51:00.519 align:start position:0%
that the heaviest weight and downward
 
01:51:03.810 --> 01:51:03.820 align:start position:0%
pressure on our Road toll collections so
 
01:51:05.939 --> 01:51:05.949 align:start position:0%
what that's leading us to when we're
 
01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:06.730 align:start position:0%
looking at track
 
01:51:10.650 --> 01:51:10.660 align:start position:0%
the crates we reach out with do T&amp;C what
 
01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:11.890 align:start position:0%
they're seeing on the roads
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
they started off at the beginning of the
 
01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:17.950 align:start position:0%
Cova Deven over 50% decline in traffic
 
01:51:20.250 --> 01:51:20.260 align:start position:0%
as we're moving through this month it's
 
01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:22.270 align:start position:0%
starting to recover somewhat we're in
 
01:51:25.410 --> 01:51:25.420 align:start position:0%
the 40s range now according to do T and
 
01:51:27.090 --> 01:51:27.100 align:start position:0%
that's really aligning with what we're
 
01:51:30.990 --> 01:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
seeing in road toll collections also so
 
01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:32.650 align:start position:0%
for road toll projections for the rest
 
01:51:36.330 --> 01:51:36.340 align:start position:0%
of FY 21 FY 20 we're projecting to
 
01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:38.410 align:start position:0%
collect one hundred and fourteen point
 
01:51:41.070 --> 01:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
seven million that's an eleven point
 
01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:44.370 align:start position:0%
nine percent decrease from plan this
 
01:51:47.729 --> 01:51:47.739 align:start position:0%
assumption where we're making is that
 
01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:48.670 align:start position:0%
we'll have a fifty percent
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
year-over-year decrease in collections
 
01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:54.310 align:start position:0%
in both May and June this is based off
 
01:51:56.370 --> 01:51:56.380 align:start position:0%
of our April collections which were down
 
01:51:59.700 --> 01:51:59.710 align:start position:0%
25% with Road told we're collecting in
 
01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:03.250 align:start position:0%
arrears so our on April collections on
 
01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:05.170 align:start position:0%
April 20th actually represents March
 
01:52:08.130 --> 01:52:08.140 align:start position:0%
usage then we looked at that 25% number
 
01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
we realized that's half of a month of
 
01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:13.590 align:start position:0%
kovat impact so it made sense to
 
01:52:16.590 --> 01:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
increase that to a 50% impact for May
 
01:52:19.110 --> 01:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
and June the good news is is our
 
01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:21.310 align:start position:0%
preliminary May amounts are coming in
 
01:52:23.610 --> 01:52:23.620 align:start position:0%
closer to 40% so it looks like we were
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
overly conservative there the difference
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
there could is about a million dollars
 
01:52:30.570 --> 01:52:30.580 align:start position:0%
in revenue so that is positive but we're
 
01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:32.050 align:start position:0%
going to keep an eye on that especially
 
01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:34.630 align:start position:0%
as we're seeing more traffic out there
 
01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:37.450 align:start position:0%
on the roads carrying that forward into
 
01:52:40.650 --> 01:52:40.660 align:start position:0%
FY 21 we're projecting to collect one
 
01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:42.730 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifteen point six million in
 
01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:45.190 align:start position:0%
road toll which is twelve point six
 
01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:49.270 align:start position:0%
percent lesson plan and we assumed a 40%
 
01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:51.550 align:start position:0%
decrease year-over-year in July
 
01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:54.250 align:start position:0%
collections and that's slowly increasing
 
01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:56.350 align:start position:0%
to a five percent decrease in December
 
01:52:58.500 --> 01:52:58.510 align:start position:0%
and then we have you either a three or a
 
01:53:00.150 --> 01:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
two percent decrease for the remainder
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
of January through June so again trying
 
01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:05.530 align:start position:0%
to capture the impact of a recovery over
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
the next six months but realizing that
 
01:53:10.890 --> 01:53:10.900 align:start position:0%
there will be a longer-term impact on on
 
01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
revenue collections for Road toll could
 
01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:19.570 align:start position:0%
you send those monthly charts to us the
 
01:53:19.570 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
you send those monthly charts to us the
MA

01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:20.530 align:start position:0%
MA
 
01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:22.710 align:start position:0%
a monthly estimate you're reading from
 
01:53:24.930 --> 01:53:24.940 align:start position:0%
yeah these are these are a summary of
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
those sheets I can absolutely send you
 
01:53:31.410 --> 01:53:31.420 align:start position:0%
the details great thank you the next
 
01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:33.550 align:start position:0%
major source of revenue has to do with
 
01:53:37.890 --> 01:53:37.900 align:start position:0%
DMV so one of the good news a little bit
 
01:53:39.930 --> 01:53:39.940 align:start position:0%
of good news is that many of the DMV
 
01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
sources the revenue is not going to
 
01:53:45.689 --> 01:53:45.699 align:start position:0%
necessarily disappear or be lost like
 
01:53:48.810 --> 01:53:48.820 align:start position:0%
like Road toll that will be shifted DMV
 
01:53:51.029 --> 01:53:51.039 align:start position:0%
has worked hard to stay open as best as
 
01:53:52.529 --> 01:53:52.539 align:start position:0%
they can and they're offering services
 
01:53:55.439 --> 01:53:55.449 align:start position:0%
online by appointment by phone there's
 
01:53:57.959 --> 01:53:57.969 align:start position:0%
Dropbox's at eight locations and so
 
01:53:59.490 --> 01:53:59.500 align:start position:0%
that's really helped to minimize the
 
01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:03.630 align:start position:0%
impact on our DMV generated revenue
 
01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:06.250 align:start position:0%
registrations is the first area we're
 
01:54:08.279 --> 01:54:08.289 align:start position:0%
projecting to collect eighty four point
 
01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:11.590 align:start position:0%
two million in twenty which is about one
 
01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:14.770 align:start position:0%
percent less than plan April was down
 
01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:17.260 align:start position:0%
twelve percent and we assumed a fifteen
 
01:54:19.290 --> 01:54:19.300 align:start position:0%
percent decrease in May and a ten
 
01:54:21.479 --> 01:54:21.489 align:start position:0%
percent decrease in June and then
 
01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:23.110 align:start position:0%
carrying that forward into twenty one
 
01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:24.610 align:start position:0%
we're projecting to collect eighty two
 
01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:27.250 align:start position:0%
point six million which is three percent
 
01:54:29.970 --> 01:54:29.980 align:start position:0%
less than plan and that assumed is a ten
 
01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:33.070 align:start position:0%
percent decrease in July improving to a
 
01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
five percent decrease through December
 
01:54:36.810 --> 01:54:36.820 align:start position:0%
and then that's three to two percent
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
decrease for January through June motor
 
01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:44.110 align:start position:0%
vehicle operators this is your license
 
01:54:46.890 --> 01:54:46.900 align:start position:0%
revenue so again customers here can
 
01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:50.070 align:start position:0%
renew online once every ten years and
 
01:54:54.209 --> 01:54:54.219 align:start position:0%
we've also DMV also is allowing through
 
01:54:55.979 --> 01:54:55.989 align:start position:0%
through executive order has been allowed
 
01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:02.230 align:start position:0%
to expired licenses or those who will
 
01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:04.690 align:start position:0%
expire by June 30 could apply for a six
 
01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:06.610 align:start position:0%
month extension and so what that did was
 
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
allowed us to collect that revenue now
 
01:55:11.279 --> 01:55:11.289 align:start position:0%
instead of having it shift into future
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
periods and also Real ID compliance that
 
01:55:16.319 --> 01:55:16.329 align:start position:0%
deadline has been extended to October
 
01:55:16.329 --> 01:55:18.149 align:start position:0%
deadline has been extended to October
2021

01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:55:19.709 --> 01:55:19.719 align:start position:0%
and so that's that was an important
 
01:55:21.089 --> 01:55:21.099 align:start position:0%
piece that that the customers were
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about rejecting out our
 
01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:27.130 align:start position:0%
revenues for FY 24 expecting to collect
 
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
eleven point eight million in an
 
01:55:32.339 --> 01:55:32.349 align:start position:0%
operator's revenue which is eleven
 
01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:34.210 align:start position:0%
percent less than plan
 
01:55:37.290 --> 01:55:37.300 align:start position:0%
Apryl revenue collections were down 43%
 
01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:41.290 align:start position:0%
and our fy2010 assumes a 45 percent
 
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:44.140 align:start position:0%
decrease in May and a 50% decrease in
 
01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:47.230 align:start position:0%
June and then projecting to collect in
 
01:55:51.810 --> 01:55:51.820 align:start position:0%
FY 21 7.3 million which is a thirteen
 
01:55:54.209 --> 01:55:54.219 align:start position:0%
point eight percent decrease from plan
 
01:55:57.810 --> 01:55:57.820 align:start position:0%
it's significantly lower than FY 20 but
 
01:56:00.330 --> 01:56:00.340 align:start position:0%
that was a planned dip because of the
 
01:56:02.370 --> 01:56:02.380 align:start position:0%
the dip here when we moved from a four
 
01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:04.210 align:start position:0%
year to a five year license renewal and
 
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
so that's already been accounted for in
 
01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:07.270 align:start position:0%
our plan numbers which is why the
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
percentage is relatively consistent with
 
01:56:14.370 --> 01:56:14.380 align:start position:0%
the prior year projection moving on to
 
01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:17.380 align:start position:0%
inspection station fees we're projecting
 
01:56:20.610 --> 01:56:20.620 align:start position:0%
to collect 3.9 million which is a 7%
 
01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:25.270 align:start position:0%
over plan we had collected additional
 
01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:26.710 align:start position:0%
revenues throughout the year which is
 
01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:27.850 align:start position:0%
why there's an increase here
 
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
however April was still down thirteen
 
01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:32.380 align:start position:0%
point eight percent and we carried that
 
01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:34.450 align:start position:0%
forward into a 15 percent decrease in
 
01:56:37.170 --> 01:56:37.180 align:start position:0%
May and a 10 percent decrease in June to
 
01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:39.310 align:start position:0%
arrive at the three point nine and then
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
we're also projecting to collect three
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
point nine and FY twenty one that starts
 
01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:46.270 align:start position:0%
with an assumption of fifteen percent
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
decrease in July through the five
 
01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:50.350 align:start position:0%
percent increase in December and then
 
01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:51.730 align:start position:0%
the overall three to two percent
 
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
decrease for the second half of the year
 
01:56:57.810 --> 01:56:57.820 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle title the automobile
 
01:56:59.700 --> 01:56:59.710 align:start position:0%
dealers are still open and DMV still
 
01:57:03.690 --> 01:57:03.700 align:start position:0%
providing title services they they there
 
01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
has been a drop that we've seen based on
 
01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:07.810 align:start position:0%
that we're projecting to collect eight
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
point six million in revenues in FY 2011
 
01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:15.030 align:start position:0%
point six percent decline from plan
 
01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:17.950 align:start position:0%
April was down fifty three percent and
 
01:57:19.290 --> 01:57:19.300 align:start position:0%
we assumed a fifty three percent
 
01:57:21.209 --> 01:57:21.219 align:start position:0%
decrease in May and a fifty percent
 
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:24.250 align:start position:0%
decrease in June then we're projecting
 
01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:28.660 align:start position:0%
nine point four percent in collections
 
01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:31.330 align:start position:0%
in FY 21 which is four point three
 
01:57:33.330 --> 01:57:33.340 align:start position:0%
percent less than planned
 
01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
and this assumes a decrease of twenty
 
01:57:38.670 --> 01:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
five percent in July improving to a five
 
01:57:40.650 --> 01:57:40.660 align:start position:0%
percent decrease through December and
 
01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:42.430 align:start position:0%
then the overall three to two percent
 
01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:44.250 align:start position:0%
decrease for the rest of the year and
 
01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:47.679 align:start position:0%
then finally miscellaneous fees
 
01:57:49.709 --> 01:57:49.719 align:start position:0%
these this is the area that includes
 
01:57:51.899 --> 01:57:51.909 align:start position:0%
plea by male court fines licensed
 
01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:53.110 align:start position:0%
restorations and some other
 
01:57:56.490 --> 01:57:56.500 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous fees here we're projecting
 
01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:01.570 align:start position:0%
to collect 16 million in FY 25.2%
 
01:58:06.630 --> 01:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
decline from plan April we're down 54%
 
01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:09.250 align:start position:0%
and we're assuming a 50% decrease in May
 
01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:11.590 align:start position:0%
and a 61 percent decrease in June and
 
01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:13.690 align:start position:0%
then we're projecting to collect sixteen
 
01:58:16.410 --> 01:58:16.420 align:start position:0%
point six million in FY 21 which is a
 
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
four point one percent four point one
 
01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:21.100 align:start position:0%
percent under plan and as these
 
01:58:23.459 --> 01:58:23.469 align:start position:0%
assumptions are an average decrease of
 
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
fifty percent in July improving to five
 
01:58:27.899 --> 01:58:27.909 align:start position:0%
percent through December and a three to
 
01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:29.980 align:start position:0%
two percent decline for the rest of the
 
01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:32.949 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so again our total highway
 
01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:36.310 align:start position:0%
fund revenues for FY 2002 two hundred
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
and thirty nine point four million which
 
01:58:40.649 --> 01:58:40.659 align:start position:0%
is just under twenty million short of
 
01:58:43.770 --> 01:58:43.780 align:start position:0%
plan and then we're projecting for FY 21
 
01:58:45.899 --> 01:58:45.909 align:start position:0%
to be two hundred and thirty-four point
 
01:58:48.450 --> 01:58:48.460 align:start position:0%
nine million which is again just over
 
01:58:52.140 --> 01:58:52.150 align:start position:0%
two twenty one just 21 million short
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
plan or eight point two percent and I'm
 
01:58:57.390 --> 01:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that you
 
01:58:59.520 --> 01:58:59.530 align:start position:0%
have related to those to those estimates
 
01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:06.850 align:start position:0%
I would really like to get the month by
 
01:59:08.850 --> 01:59:08.860 align:start position:0%
month you've been talking for us it's
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to follow without them your
 
01:59:16.830 --> 01:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm happy to provide that I'll
 
01:59:19.110 --> 01:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
provide that to come here to the
 
01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:22.690 align:start position:0%
committee mm-hmm to the committee why
 
01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:25.570 align:start position:0%
can you do it tomorrow your then or
 
01:59:29.459 --> 01:59:29.469 align:start position:0%
today jammer thank you you can go ahead
 
01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:31.690 align:start position:0%
and send it through me okay then I'll
 
01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:37.270 align:start position:0%
make sure that committee gets it me has
 
01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:41.130 align:start position:0%
a question yeah we we talk about another
 
01:59:43.290 --> 01:59:43.300 align:start position:0%
conversations with others that auto
 
01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:47.170 align:start position:0%
sales were down I just unpacked you
 
01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:49.270 align:start position:0%
folks because people just hang on to
 
01:59:50.330 --> 01:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
their cars I'm registered
 
01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:55.170 align:start position:0%
cars versus registering a new car but I
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
just had a random thought for everybody
 
01:59:59.600 --> 01:59:59.610 align:start position:0%
that I think this is gonna impact our
 
02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
towns because theirs is the revenue
 
02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:04.650 align:start position:0%
talents get from registrations a lot
 
02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:09.210 align:start position:0%
more than the state in terms of based on
 
02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:12.030 align:start position:0%
the value of the car so that's something
 
02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:13.710 align:start position:0%
that we should all keep in mind with our
 
02:00:22.609 --> 02:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
towns yeah just using my party yeah
 
02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:24.210 align:start position:0%
absolutely right because we are at the
 
02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:26.550 align:start position:0%
state level it's the the fee is based on
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
weight so that's not going to change if
 
02:00:30.859 --> 02:00:30.869 align:start position:0%
you hold your vehicle longer we won't be
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
impacted but the town's absolutely will
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
be because the value is going to
 
02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:42.030 align:start position:0%
continue to decrease if spent that and a
 
02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:49.619 align:start position:0%
lot of property tax uncollectible so any
 
02:00:54.890 --> 02:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
further questions about this one then
 
02:01:00.410 --> 02:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Oh how do you how do you have
 
02:01:04.459 --> 02:01:04.469 align:start position:0%
the state troopers just estimating how
 
02:01:06.050 --> 02:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
much traffic they're seeing on the roads
 
02:01:10.339 --> 02:01:10.349 align:start position:0%
is that how you've been doing that as
 
02:01:13.879 --> 02:01:13.889 align:start position:0%
far as the plea by mail amounts and
 
02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:16.290 align:start position:0%
those those figures know you were
 
02:01:20.479 --> 02:01:20.489 align:start position:0%
talking about the traffic oh yes I'm
 
02:01:20.489 --> 02:01:20.810 align:start position:0%
talking about the traffic oh yes I'm
sorry

02:01:20.810 --> 02:01:20.820 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
so do t has traffic counters on the
 
02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
turnpike system and then they some some
 
02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:32.130 align:start position:0%
equipment and other areas across the
 
02:01:35.330 --> 02:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
state and we we typically reach out the
 
02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:37.110 align:start position:0%
d-o-t and ask them what they're seeing
 
02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:39.750 align:start position:0%
from their traffic counting is they're
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
very concerned about that for turnpike
 
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
system purposes and we incorporate that
 
02:01:48.979 --> 02:01:48.989 align:start position:0%
data into our analysis thank you so this
 
02:01:55.570 --> 02:01:55.580 align:start position:0%
is biased towards the big birds yes
 
02:01:58.250 --> 02:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
though I must say I've been seeing a
 
02:02:01.339 --> 02:02:01.349 align:start position:0%
whole lot of traffic until recently on
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
the other roads
 
02:02:07.330 --> 02:02:07.340 align:start position:0%
but recently things have been getting a
 
02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:13.310 align:start position:0%
lot they may be half normal at this
 
02:02:18.970 --> 02:02:18.980 align:start position:0%
point and they keep going Aryan
 
02:02:21.010 --> 02:02:21.020 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly seeing more traffic over
 
02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:23.510 align:start position:0%
the last two weeks on the way in driving
 
02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:26.870 align:start position:0%
it I've been seeing more traffic heading
 
02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:29.870 align:start position:0%
into Concord that I have a month ago so
 
02:02:35.530 --> 02:02:35.540 align:start position:0%
I'm noticing it anecdotally as well and
 
02:02:37.479 --> 02:02:37.489 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of construction
 
02:02:40.990 --> 02:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
being done hmm there's always
 
02:02:45.370 --> 02:02:45.380 align:start position:0%
construction being done good yeah a lot
 
02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:47.870 align:start position:0%
more smaller projects so you think
 
02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:49.070 align:start position:0%
you're finished with one and you go
 
02:02:54.780 --> 02:02:54.790 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:01.690 align:start position:0%
has a question yes um on the traffic
 
02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:04.250 align:start position:0%
looking at the post from the State
 
02:03:07.450 --> 02:03:07.460 align:start position:0%
Police it should also be a rather large
 
02:03:11.709 --> 02:03:11.719 align:start position:0%
increase in plea by mail although most
 
02:03:13.630 --> 02:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
of the ones that they're publishing on
 
02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:15.530 align:start position:0%
their website they're going to have to
 
02:03:16.930 --> 02:03:16.940 align:start position:0%
appear in person because they're gonna
 
02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:20.270 align:start position:0%
go to jail for doing 134 through a
 
02:03:24.610 --> 02:03:24.620 align:start position:0%
construction zone but speeding is up
 
02:03:28.930 --> 02:03:28.940 align:start position:0%
stops by speeding up and as a result
 
02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:32.510 align:start position:0%
that will generate unfortunately I hate
 
02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:34.250 align:start position:0%
to say it but it will generate more
 
02:03:41.229 --> 02:03:41.239 align:start position:0%
revenues as opposed to 50 $10 fines
 
02:03:44.169 --> 02:03:44.179 align:start position:0%
there's going to be five five hundred
 
02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:49.070 align:start position:0%
dollar fines just numbers not facts just
 
02:03:53.550 --> 02:03:53.560 align:start position:0%
just as a point of consideration on that
 
02:03:57.459 --> 02:03:57.469 align:start position:0%
done that would be interesting we
 
02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
usually see fines going down during
 
02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:06.590 align:start position:0%
during recessions driving faster much
 
02:04:06.590 --> 02:04:07.330 align:start position:0%
during recessions driving faster much
faster

02:04:07.330 --> 02:04:07.340 align:start position:0%
faster
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
I mean um up your area they just had a
 
02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:13.070 align:start position:0%
guy coming down the hill he was doing a
 
02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
hundred miles an hour going down the
 
02:04:16.359 --> 02:04:16.369 align:start position:0%
hill heading into Lebanon
 
02:04:19.419 --> 02:04:19.429 align:start position:0%
I mean yeah it's easy to feed there but
 
02:04:23.259 --> 02:04:23.269 align:start position:0%
I'm miles an hour that one didn't even
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
get into her our city's police bulletin
 
02:04:29.119 --> 02:04:30.339 align:start position:0%
get into her our city's police bulletin
Wow

02:04:30.339 --> 02:04:30.349 align:start position:0%
Wow
 
02:04:36.429 --> 02:04:36.439 align:start position:0%
don't buy the State Police thing okay we
 
02:04:39.819 --> 02:04:39.829 align:start position:0%
only look at this at the city one thank
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
you so any further questions and thank
 
02:04:49.119 --> 02:04:49.129 align:start position:0%
you very much Steve thank you thank you
 
02:04:58.659 --> 02:04:58.669 align:start position:0%
everyone and now we get to doing this
 
02:05:08.429 --> 02:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
have people been looking presentations
 
02:05:13.299 --> 02:05:13.309 align:start position:0%
because the idea was that we would ask
 
02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:15.530 align:start position:0%
questions if we had anyone and we'd
 
02:05:17.919 --> 02:05:17.929 align:start position:0%
bring someone up from the audience to
 
02:05:21.579 --> 02:05:21.589 align:start position:0%
discuss them but in order to ask
 
02:05:23.799 --> 02:05:23.809 align:start position:0%
questions we have to evolve look we have
 
02:05:27.399 --> 02:05:27.409 align:start position:0%
to have looked at this but I'd say we've
 
02:05:36.909 --> 02:05:36.919 align:start position:0%
got four we've got a number of things in
 
02:05:41.679 --> 02:05:41.689 align:start position:0%
the judicial system which which does not
 
02:05:44.859 --> 02:05:44.869 align:start position:0%
provide a huge amount of money to us but
 
02:05:54.239 --> 02:05:54.249 align:start position:0%
which seemed a little noteworthy that
 
02:05:59.889 --> 02:05:59.899 align:start position:0%
the fees from background checks that
 
02:06:03.279 --> 02:06:03.289 align:start position:0%
made sense that to me that the fee is
 
02:06:05.379 --> 02:06:05.389 align:start position:0%
from background checks have gone down
 
02:06:09.369 --> 02:06:09.379 align:start position:0%
considerably because employers are not
 
02:06:12.189 --> 02:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
employing no people and because
 
02:06:14.529 --> 02:06:14.539 align:start position:0%
landlords are not going to be able to
 
02:06:16.899 --> 02:06:16.909 align:start position:0%
find very many tenants to replace the
 
02:06:19.179 --> 02:06:19.189 align:start position:0%
people is they're going to evict and
 
02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:23.630 align:start position:0%
they can't evict anybody at the moment
 
02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:32.750 align:start position:0%
and there is a question entry fees which
 
02:06:40.350 --> 02:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
is also landlord-tenant issue that those
 
02:06:46.630 --> 02:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
are expected to go go down quite a lot
 
02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
because of the governor's mandate but in
 
02:06:59.160 --> 02:06:59.170 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:03.290 align:start position:0%
considerably the next year which makes
 
02:07:17.089 --> 02:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:19.230 align:start position:0%
now the only restaurant of Romney's got
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
his hand raised
 
02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:23.130 align:start position:0%
Oh representative Romney
 
02:07:27.530 --> 02:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
oh yes on the summer heat you want court
 
02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
fines and fees yes court fines and fees
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay before I make sure if there's
 
02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
somebody from street they drop in from
 
02:07:44.450 --> 02:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
this year if that's what you're trying
 
02:07:49.550 --> 02:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
to get out there but yes we have Donna
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
Raymond from the courts and Chris
 
02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:52.650 align:start position:0%
Keating from the courts that can respond
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
to any questions you might have is the
 
02:08:23.810 --> 02:08:23.820 align:start position:0%
entire amount you mean yes Joe is that
 
02:08:27.339 --> 02:08:27.349 align:start position:0%
better yes okay sorry
 
02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:33.090 align:start position:0%
so actually I I let the actual data sort
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
of inform my projection and attached to
 
02:08:38.959 --> 02:08:38.969 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet that was sent it's
 
02:08:40.879 --> 02:08:40.889 align:start position:0%
actually an Excel back in that there are
 
02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:43.590 align:start position:0%
hidden have them there one of them is
 
02:08:46.370 --> 02:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
the day-by-day revenues that we
 
02:08:48.979 --> 02:08:48.989 align:start position:0%
collected in each one of these revenue
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
accounts but we have sort of the
 
02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:54.570 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic through March 13 revenues
 
02:08:57.560 --> 02:08:57.570 align:start position:0%
and then we have a post March 16 and on
 
02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:01.590 align:start position:0%
and I looked at what was happening we
 
02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:03.570 align:start position:0%
had it was interesting you sort of saw
 
02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
the week of March 16 through March 20
 
02:09:09.290 --> 02:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
was sort of a transition week where
 
02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:11.250 align:start position:0%
that's when you really saw things slide
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
and then things sort of leveled off week
 
02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:17.550 align:start position:0%
after the governor stay-at-home order
 
02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:24.150 align:start position:0%
was issued Oh then so obviously great
 
02:09:27.819 --> 02:09:27.829 align:start position:0%
but I tried to let those several weeks
 
02:09:30.649 --> 02:09:30.659 align:start position:0%
after in an for
 
02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:33.750 align:start position:0%
what was going to happen in terms of
 
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 sort of a low-end and a
 
02:09:37.490 --> 02:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
high-end not really knowing how all of
 
02:09:39.410 --> 02:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
these factors were going to influence
 
02:09:42.590 --> 02:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers I think you know there are a
 
02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:44.790 align:start position:0%
couple of things at play obviously stay
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
at home is going to have somewhat of an
 
02:09:50.479 --> 02:09:50.489 align:start position:0%
immediate impact but as the state opens
 
02:09:52.419 --> 02:09:52.429 align:start position:0%
up we've already seen in the last month
 
02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:54.270 align:start position:0%
anecdotally we've seen more cars on the
 
02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:56.250 align:start position:0%
road so that's a good time do you
 
02:09:58.370 --> 02:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
believe though that the unemployment
 
02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:01.290 align:start position:0%
issue is going to inflict a deeper wound
 
02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:02.670 align:start position:0%
that's going to take longer to heal
 
02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:06.150 align:start position:0%
that's also going to and some of the
 
02:10:08.570 --> 02:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
revenues that we take in penalty
 
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
assessments for admin fees from Safety
 
02:10:12.890 --> 02:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
and Motor Vehicles is they're all motor
 
02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
vehicle related in some way so I try
 
02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:19.830 align:start position:0%
each each of the four quarters in fiscal
 
02:10:22.459 --> 02:10:22.469 align:start position:0%
year 21 estimate what I thought was
 
02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:24.090 align:start position:0%
gonna happen percentage-wise of an
 
02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:26.610 align:start position:0%
improvement in fact that into the
 
02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
overall figures that you see there so in
 
02:10:31.090 --> 02:10:31.100 align:start position:0%
short I tried to look at different
 
02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:33.270 align:start position:0%
factors at play what I thought was going
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
to be happening on a quarterly basis
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
having it informed by what we saw things
 
02:11:13.930 --> 02:11:13.940 align:start position:0%
more quickly where court appearances
 
02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:16.830 align:start position:0%
what's going on is there pent up bunch
 
02:11:27.050 --> 02:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
of cases out there so Donna I'll try to
 
02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:40.230 align:start position:0%
answer that Chris Keating Donna do you
 
02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:41.950 align:start position:0%
want to give it a try
 
02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
you mean Chris is your phone muted yeah
 
02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:52.330 align:start position:0%
nope here we go
 
02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:00.190 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now yes there you go so
 
02:12:02.490 --> 02:12:02.500 align:start position:0%
the courts have been trying to limit the
 
02:12:04.170 --> 02:12:04.180 align:start position:0%
number of people who come into the
 
02:12:07.620 --> 02:12:07.630 align:start position:0%
courthouses since this started to just
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
emergency hearings people seeking
 
02:12:14.460 --> 02:12:14.470 align:start position:0%
protections from abuse guardianship so
 
02:12:17.150 --> 02:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
ver incapacitated people and the like
 
02:12:20.010 --> 02:12:20.020 align:start position:0%
but we've been open for business and
 
02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:21.850 align:start position:0%
every single courthouse has been open
 
02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:27.130 align:start position:0%
all day long every working day and what
 
02:12:28.710 --> 02:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is get the word out
 
02:12:31.380 --> 02:12:31.390 align:start position:0%
to lawyers that we are wide open to take
 
02:12:34.710 --> 02:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
anything that they can accomplish over a
 
02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:38.830 align:start position:0%
WebEx session over a teleconference or
 
02:12:41.850 --> 02:12:41.860 align:start position:0%
by paper and so it's been a struggle to
 
02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:44.170 align:start position:0%
get the word out to lawyers because the
 
02:12:45.690 --> 02:12:45.700 align:start position:0%
lawyers have been so accustomed to
 
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
showing up in court with a client but
 
02:12:52.020 --> 02:12:52.030 align:start position:0%
the the administrative judges have been
 
02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:54.790 align:start position:0%
trying to get the word out to to lawyers
 
02:12:58.680 --> 02:12:58.690 align:start position:0%
and anybody who'll listen that we are we
 
02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:02.170 align:start position:0%
are willing to to entertain any creative
 
02:13:04.410 --> 02:13:04.420 align:start position:0%
method to resolve cases so if people
 
02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:10.810 align:start position:0%
want to submit a plea to a DWI we'll do
 
02:13:14.010 --> 02:13:14.020 align:start position:0%
it by paper we're even doing pleas in
 
02:13:18.150 --> 02:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
felony cases by paper and and these are
 
02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:22.090 align:start position:0%
self-report people to stand committed
 
02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
sentences at the jails on paper we're
 
02:13:27.870 --> 02:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
doing just an astounding amount of work
 
02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:30.370 align:start position:0%
now we've got all of the courts set up
 
02:13:34.890 --> 02:13:34.900 align:start position:0%
on WebEx to do hearings by WebEx and
 
02:13:36.630 --> 02:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearings where people are
 
02:13:40.290 --> 02:13:40.300 align:start position:0%
submitting documents electronically so
 
02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
we're just we not until June 15th are we
 
02:13:45.810 --> 02:13:45.820 align:start position:0%
letting more people into courthouses to
 
02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:49.270 align:start position:0%
conduct to conduct here things and
 
02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:52.750 align:start position:0%
they're sort of regular business but
 
02:13:56.100 --> 02:13:56.110 align:start position:0%
even so we probably won't go back to
 
02:13:58.919 --> 02:13:58.929 align:start position:0%
as many in-person hearings as we used to
 
02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:02.290 align:start position:0%
and we really do we really plan to do a
 
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff by this method ideally
 
02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:08.710 align:start position:0%
without the crazy echoing but in the
 
02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:11.110 align:start position:0%
future or just try to try to resolve
 
02:14:14.250 --> 02:14:14.260 align:start position:0%
cases as efficiently as possible and so
 
02:14:16.439 --> 02:14:16.449 align:start position:0%
you know the message that I would say is
 
02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:20.290 align:start position:0%
have have you have your constituents or
 
02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
friends lawyers just get in touch with
 
02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
the clerk and make arrangements to get
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:48.419 --> 02:14:48.429 align:start position:0%
absolutely sir there is kind of
 
02:14:53.250 --> 02:14:53.260 align:start position:0%
situations yes sir we've we've cancelled
 
02:14:56.840 --> 02:14:56.850 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court 30,000 hearings
 
02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:01.150 align:start position:0%
that that need to be not all of them
 
02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:03.130 align:start position:0%
will be put back on the docket but at
 
02:15:06.330 --> 02:15:06.340 align:start position:0%
least 30% of them will need to be put
 
02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:08.050 align:start position:0%
back on the docket you know because some
 
02:15:11.010 --> 02:15:11.020 align:start position:0%
work you know anticipatory dispositional
 
02:15:13.919 --> 02:15:13.929 align:start position:0%
type hearings that you know are just
 
02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
never gonna happen again but but
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
resolving the case will happen which
 
02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:21.310 align:start position:0%
will result in in in fees and fines
 
02:15:22.770 --> 02:15:22.780 align:start position:0%
getting ordered by the court and
 
02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:24.550 align:start position:0%
collected by the court and delivered to
 
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:30.010 align:start position:0%
Treasury I might also add to the Senate
 
02:15:31.890 --> 02:15:31.900 align:start position:0%
maybe helpful we are continuing to make
 
02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:34.810 align:start position:0%
inroads in sort of transforming the
 
02:15:37.379 --> 02:15:37.389 align:start position:0%
courts we are in the process now of
 
02:15:39.629 --> 02:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
deploying some of our staff as well as
 
02:15:41.459 --> 02:15:41.469 align:start position:0%
Bureau of court facility staff to visit
 
02:15:43.590 --> 02:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
a small medium and large court across
 
02:15:45.959 --> 02:15:45.969 align:start position:0%
the state we're gonna be figuring out
 
02:15:47.850 --> 02:15:47.860 align:start position:0%
what we need to do to get the social
 
02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:49.510 align:start position:0%
distancing in place the signage the
 
02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:52.150 align:start position:0%
stanchions the tape on the floors and
 
02:15:54.330 --> 02:15:54.340 align:start position:0%
then your court facilities is going to
 
02:15:55.890 --> 02:15:55.900 align:start position:0%
go out to all of our force and get that
 
02:15:57.450 --> 02:15:57.460 align:start position:0%
set up and the goal is to have all of
 
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:00.010 align:start position:0%
that marked off by June 15 so that will
 
02:16:01.530 --> 02:16:01.540 align:start position:0%
allow us to control a little bit more
 
02:16:04.260 --> 02:16:04.270 align:start position:0%
what's going on inside the courtrooms in
 
02:16:05.850 --> 02:16:05.860 align:start position:0%
terms of equipment I think we're we're
 
02:16:08.490 --> 02:16:08.500 align:start position:0%
pretty well stocked in terms of masks
 
02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:11.890 align:start position:0%
I mean sanitary sanitization supplies
 
02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:16.390 align:start position:0%
that we need kind of taking things in
 
02:16:19.260 --> 02:16:19.270 align:start position:0%
steps and then see are we on solid
 
02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:20.950 align:start position:0%
footing with what we're doing before we
 
02:16:22.530 --> 02:16:22.540 align:start position:0%
arrest two other things we've also
 
02:16:24.990 --> 02:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
requested nearly a hundred laptops that
 
02:16:26.490 --> 02:16:26.500 align:start position:0%
we hopefully funded through the cares
 
02:16:30.390 --> 02:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
Act funding to see if we can again
 
02:16:33.180 --> 02:16:33.190 align:start position:0%
transition some of what we do more
 
02:16:36.210 --> 02:16:36.220 align:start position:0%
remotely issues to we want to consider
 
02:16:38.730 --> 02:16:38.740 align:start position:0%
are there ways that people can handle
 
02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:42.610 align:start position:0%
hearings by phone if we have individual
 
02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:45.010 align:start position:0%
has a phone and a smartphone and the
 
02:16:46.650 --> 02:16:46.660 align:start position:0%
court has a smartphone and we do
 
02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:49.090 align:start position:0%
something with that but again get
 
02:16:50.910 --> 02:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
complicated but I think we're trying to
 
02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:53.650 align:start position:0%
do things you know step by step and see
 
02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:55.330 align:start position:0%
how we go but we're continuing to make
 
02:17:00.090 --> 02:17:00.100 align:start position:0%
inroads with this thank you could I ask
 
02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:01.450 align:start position:0%
a question about that
 
02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:04.890 align:start position:0%
I think I'm reading this chart correctly
 
02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:09.970 align:start position:0%
the plan for this year was almost twenty
 
02:17:11.850 --> 02:17:11.860 align:start position:0%
million including the highway money and
 
02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:14.530 align:start position:0%
I'll just include for the moment and
 
02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:17.770 align:start position:0%
you're projecting almost eighteen
 
02:17:17.770 --> 02:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
you're projecting almost eighteen
million

02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:18.370 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:23.230 align:start position:0%
but next year with all these changes
 
02:17:26.850 --> 02:17:26.860 align:start position:0%
you're planning on ten and a half
 
02:17:29.930 --> 02:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
million to twelve point eight million
 
02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:34.450 align:start position:0%
prepped which is a lot less than what
 
02:17:38.660 --> 02:17:38.670 align:start position:0%
you think we're getting out of this year
 
02:17:41.730 --> 02:17:41.740 align:start position:0%
so after you've made all those changes
 
02:17:43.770 --> 02:17:43.780 align:start position:0%
and you're starting to catch up you see
 
02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:48.070 align:start position:0%
you still think sorry we're going to end
 
02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:53.350 align:start position:0%
up with a lot less revenue I think what
 
02:17:56.910 --> 02:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about is the deep impact
 
02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:00.130 align:start position:0%
this is having on the economy overall I
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
was not with the judicial branch in 2008
 
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
I'm fortunate I joined in June of 2012
 
02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:09.690 align:start position:0%
but it would be interesting to compare
 
02:18:12.990 --> 02:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
what the impact to revenues was in that
 
02:18:14.460 --> 02:18:14.470 align:start position:0%
scenario because the only difference
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
there well a primary difference is to
 
02:18:18.650 --> 02:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
say at home order that's in place now
 
02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:22.210 align:start position:0%
but economy being hard-hit this
 
02:18:24.990 --> 02:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
as well as last time but I suspect even
 
02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:27.130 align:start position:0%
as you had mentioned when we have a bad
 
02:18:29.820 --> 02:18:29.830 align:start position:0%
economic downturn you see motor vehicle
 
02:18:31.310 --> 02:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
fines and things they tend to drop off
 
02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:34.570 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm anticipating some of that but
 
02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:36.550 align:start position:0%
again it's just it's more you know the
 
02:18:38.129 --> 02:18:38.139 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home orders are gonna lift they
 
02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:39.670 align:start position:0%
don't open up more so that will help
 
02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:41.170 align:start position:0%
things but I just think it's going to
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
take a long time for the economy overall
 
02:18:44.910 --> 02:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
to recover people still get me out of
 
02:18:48.270 --> 02:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
work I'm hoping I'm wrong I serve it up
 
02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:50.050 align:start position:0%
in my estimates and I'd be pleasantly
 
02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:02.130 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:06.070 align:start position:0%
ourselves I don't remember anything like
 
02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:10.690 align:start position:0%
this steep ever and I was you're screwed
 
02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:12.490 align:start position:0%
it's a Great Recession I was here for
 
02:19:13.890 --> 02:19:13.900 align:start position:0%
ten years before that
 
02:19:19.230 --> 02:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
yeah again I'll be looking at a month by
 
02:19:21.089 --> 02:19:21.099 align:start position:0%
month and well obviously if I see
 
02:19:22.919 --> 02:19:22.929 align:start position:0%
upturns and things I will revise these
 
02:19:32.459 --> 02:19:32.469 align:start position:0%
estimates yeah okay thank you any
 
02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:36.370 align:start position:0%
further up cinema brought me this for
 
02:19:39.060 --> 02:19:39.070 align:start position:0%
you Susan maybe Chris you were just
 
02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:45.550 align:start position:0%
quoting some way she Chris will you pay
 
02:19:45.550 --> 02:19:47.180 align:start position:0%
quoting some way she Chris will you pay
yep

02:19:47.180 --> 02:19:47.190 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:19:51.719 --> 02:19:51.729 align:start position:0%
what it was referring to as the total
 
02:19:56.610 --> 02:19:56.620 align:start position:0%
revenue collected by the courts so if
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
you look at the document the summary
 
02:20:02.490 --> 02:20:02.500 align:start position:0%
document you can see motor vehicle fines
 
02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:05.890 align:start position:0%
is but in the middle of the page that's
 
02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:07.930 align:start position:0%
their highway funds and then the other
 
02:20:10.140 --> 02:20:10.150 align:start position:0%
piece that is different is the first row
 
02:20:13.530 --> 02:20:13.540 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment that revenue goes
 
02:20:16.590 --> 02:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
into the other category so when you're
 
02:20:19.290 --> 02:20:19.300 align:start position:0%
looking at the courts revenue on your
 
02:20:22.050 --> 02:20:22.060 align:start position:0%
estimate sheet it's starts with court
 
02:20:23.790 --> 02:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
admin fees and goes to miscellaneous
 
02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:26.290 align:start position:0%
sales revenue you back out the penalty
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
assessment and that's what I did on your
 
02:20:31.290 --> 02:20:31.300 align:start position:0%
worksheet for you okay so then I guess
 
02:20:32.070 --> 02:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
poor lunatic
 
02:21:00.770 --> 02:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
all those things okay so it's not well
 
02:21:05.070 --> 02:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
it's still considerably reduced 421
 
02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:13.090 align:start position:0%
about 25 percent or so from 20 okay
 
02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:16.870 align:start position:0%
so it'd be interesting to look looking
 
02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:19.210 align:start position:0%
well go back and look at those for the
 
02:21:24.290 --> 02:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
Great Recession see what that did
 
02:21:27.090 --> 02:21:27.100 align:start position:0%
any further questions doesn't look like
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:43.490 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:48.450 align:start position:0%
Charlie Arling house and the I'm not
 
02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:53.850 align:start position:0%
sure if the Comptroller is with us yes
 
02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
you have lost charlie excuse me
 
02:21:58.519 --> 02:21:58.529 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arleen house and a
 
02:22:00.110 --> 02:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
controller they had to go to another
 
02:22:02.330 --> 02:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
meeting okay there are specific
 
02:22:05.620 --> 02:22:05.630 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee might have
 
02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:07.830 align:start position:0%
I'm truly reached out and said they'd be
 
02:22:09.889 --> 02:22:09.899 align:start position:0%
happy to address them if I sent an email
 
02:22:12.910 --> 02:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
to him yeah does anybody have questions
 
02:22:17.690 --> 02:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
about the other revenue sources I'm here
 
02:22:22.010 --> 02:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to I can't show this thing it
 
02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:25.170 align:start position:0%
if you have specific to what Treasury
 
02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:28.410 align:start position:0%
does as it relates to other revenue yeah
 
02:22:33.139 --> 02:22:33.149 align:start position:0%
Treasury is abandoned property only and
 
02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:37.170 align:start position:0%
there was interest budgeted yes the
 
02:22:39.620 --> 02:22:39.630 align:start position:0%
interest isn't so they could talk to
 
02:22:42.130 --> 02:22:42.140 align:start position:0%
that mm-hmm
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
if they're still here okay yeah so
 
02:22:57.380 --> 02:22:57.390 align:start position:0%
America is still still available good
 
02:22:59.360 --> 02:22:59.370 align:start position:0%
afternoon madam chair and members of the
 
02:23:02.660 --> 02:23:02.670 align:start position:0%
moon um Monica mr. Pelley Commissioner
 
02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:05.810 align:start position:0%
of the Treasury and with me also as
 
02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:07.170 align:start position:0%
Rachel Miller
 
02:23:09.710 --> 02:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
chief deputy treasurer I'd be happy to
 
02:23:15.650 --> 02:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you well we
 
02:23:22.820 --> 02:23:22.830 align:start position:0%
did have a considerable increase in in
 
02:23:27.650 --> 02:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
the interest and surplus funds category
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
for this year and no projection at all
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
for 2021 yes so so as you as you hear up
 
02:23:45.380 --> 02:23:45.390 align:start position:0%
there right now the interest rate
 
02:23:45.390 --> 02:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
there right now the interest rate
environment

02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:46.050 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
has completely changed so the last years
 
02:23:52.460 --> 02:23:52.470 align:start position:0%
we've been able to
 
02:23:55.810 --> 02:23:55.820 align:start position:0%
earn some hard dollars harder learnings
 
02:23:58.761 --> 02:23:58.771 align:start position:0%
with the interest rates that we're
 
02:24:01.490 --> 02:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
increasing over time the last three to
 
02:24:04.250 --> 02:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
four years through the judaculla
 
02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:07.050 align:start position:0%
nineteen the Federal Reserve had to
 
02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:12.330 align:start position:0%
react in and try to try to respond to
 
02:24:15.370 --> 02:24:15.380 align:start position:0%
the crisis so they lower interest rates
 
02:24:21.051 --> 02:24:21.061 align:start position:0%
from 0% to 0.25 percent so with that we
 
02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:22.650 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the interest rate
 
02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:25.670 align:start position:0%
environment will continue to be low and
 
02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:28.170 align:start position:0%
there are other factors that we were
 
02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
considering also we anticipate that with
 
02:24:34.310 --> 02:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
the revenue decline that we we are
 
02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:38.490 align:start position:0%
estimating our restricted cash balances
 
02:24:41.301 --> 02:24:41.311 align:start position:0%
will also decline so with that we have
 
02:24:43.490 --> 02:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
to look at different different different
 
02:24:46.580 --> 02:24:46.590 align:start position:0%
ways that we've been doing maintaining
 
02:24:48.591 --> 02:24:48.601 align:start position:0%
our cash balances we may need to go back
 
02:24:52.970 --> 02:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
to what was done in 2008 2009 and years
 
02:24:56.180 --> 02:24:56.190 align:start position:0%
after that try to maintain compensating
 
02:25:00.380 --> 02:25:00.390 align:start position:0%
balances in order to defray the cost the
 
02:25:02.290 --> 02:25:02.300 align:start position:0%
banking costs because those will remain
 
02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:06.090 align:start position:0%
so knowing that interest rates are going
 
02:25:08.330 --> 02:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
to remain low for some time well this
 
02:25:13.011 --> 02:25:13.021 align:start position:0%
crisis it improves and again knowing
 
02:25:17.091 --> 02:25:17.101 align:start position:0%
that our banking fees in cost will
 
02:25:20.841 --> 02:25:20.851 align:start position:0%
remain pro the same so that would be one
 
02:25:25.250 --> 02:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
way to try to mitigate those factors so
 
02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:28.890 align:start position:0%
after looking at the ad in Oh again I
 
02:25:32.450 --> 02:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
mean this situation is is uncertain
 
02:25:34.310 --> 02:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
unclear how the revenues are going to
 
02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:37.050 align:start position:0%
look you know maybe fiscal year twenty
 
02:25:39.620 --> 02:25:39.630 align:start position:0%
bubi oki fiscal year twenty one I mean
 
02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:41.010 align:start position:0%
you're looking at revenue estimates
 
02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:45.410 align:start position:0%
right now depending of how that performs
 
02:25:47.870 --> 02:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility we may need to
 
02:25:50.780 --> 02:25:50.790 align:start position:0%
engage in short-term borrowing so that
 
02:25:52.970 --> 02:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
really changes the picture of what we've
 
02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:55.590 align:start position:0%
been doing and what we thought you know
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
a year a year ago you know to give you
 
02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:02.190 align:start position:0%
some context the rates the Fed rates
 
02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:03.930 align:start position:0%
last year were
 
02:26:03.930 --> 02:26:05.500 align:start position:0%
last year were
[Music]

02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:05.510 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:26:09.290 --> 02:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
see right here we're 2.5% so now we're
 
02:26:12.889 --> 02:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
talking about 0.5% so again there's
 
02:26:15.530 --> 02:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
there's no interest right now in in the
 
02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:18.090 align:start position:0%
dissipation of that being being there
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
for a while so those are the pieces
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
emeritus really rethink how we you know
 
02:26:28.250 --> 02:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
we're estimating interest we decided to
 
02:26:30.349 --> 02:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
eliminate it for fiscal year twenty one
 
02:26:34.730 --> 02:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year twenty will be okay but
 
02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:36.330 align:start position:0%
again it doesn't appear that we will
 
02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:38.130 align:start position:0%
have interest for fiscal year twenty one
 
02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:43.530 align:start position:0%
I remember there were a number maybe
 
02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:46.050 align:start position:0%
four or five years that the treasurer
 
02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:50.130 align:start position:0%
had no interest results at all after the
 
02:26:53.620 --> 02:26:53.630 align:start position:0%
Great Recession started to take hold
 
02:26:55.849 --> 02:26:55.859 align:start position:0%
exactly asking for several years that
 
02:26:57.469 --> 02:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
was not estimated that was not
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
considered I think prior prior to 2008 I
 
02:27:04.490 --> 02:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
think there was I think there were some
 
02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:07.370 align:start position:0%
estimates being presented in the budget
 
02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:09.930 align:start position:0%
but it's been it was several years that
 
02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:13.770 align:start position:0%
that didn't occur until the budget for
 
02:27:16.450 --> 02:27:16.460 align:start position:0%
fiscal year twenty twenty twenty-one
 
02:27:19.370 --> 02:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
anyway we're back to where we were a few
 
02:27:24.050 --> 02:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
used a few years back would you like to
 
02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:32.510 align:start position:0%
see something also about the the
 
02:27:36.770 --> 02:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
abandoned property I'm not sure how many
 
02:27:41.230 --> 02:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
of the people on our committee realize
 
02:27:45.050 --> 02:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
on what's entailed in this and why it
 
02:27:47.410 --> 02:27:47.420 align:start position:0%
varies so much from year to year
 
02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:51.090 align:start position:0%
yes and uh I I did I didn't provide any
 
02:27:53.450 --> 02:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
detail because I wasn't sure you know
 
02:27:55.130 --> 02:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
what type of questions that you will
 
02:27:59.740 --> 02:27:59.750 align:start position:0%
have but you know as you may recall the
 
02:28:04.190 --> 02:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
the treatment revenue it's really the
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
abandoned property that was reported to
 
02:28:10.429 --> 02:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
us but we weren't able to return to the
 
02:28:11.389 --> 02:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
rightful owner
 
02:28:13.730 --> 02:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
so that property has been with us for
 
02:28:17.599 --> 02:28:17.609 align:start position:0%
three years the law allows us to you
 
02:28:18.801 --> 02:28:18.811 align:start position:0%
know what does not return
 
02:28:21.350 --> 02:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
the law allows us to is Cheeta to
 
02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:25.170 align:start position:0%
general fund so in that estimate we
 
02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:27.090 align:start position:0%
there are several factors in that
 
02:28:32.511 --> 02:28:32.521 align:start position:0%
formula we know how much was reported to
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
us three years ago we have to we have to
 
02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:40.410 align:start position:0%
you know determine how many claims we've
 
02:28:43.341 --> 02:28:43.351 align:start position:0%
paid against those those some those
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
properties the law also allows us to
 
02:28:49.490 --> 02:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
deduct the Minnesota costs so we do that
 
02:28:51.381 --> 02:28:51.391 align:start position:0%
and then after that is just our
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
calculation that we do in order to
 
02:28:57.650 --> 02:28:57.660 align:start position:0%
determine what is is treated to the
 
02:28:59.870 --> 02:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
counties and what can go to the general
 
02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
fund a variable in that calculation that
 
02:29:07.551 --> 02:29:07.561 align:start position:0%
is difficult to predict is the is the
 
02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:10.530 align:start position:0%
property that gets reported to us in the
 
02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
form of securities the castor was
 
02:29:17.570 --> 02:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
reported does known we know exactly how
 
02:29:19.881 --> 02:29:19.891 align:start position:0%
much that is what is unknown as the
 
02:29:23.180 --> 02:29:23.190 align:start position:0%
security so before we use cheat the
 
02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:26.250 align:start position:0%
revenue to the general fund we have to
 
02:29:29.330 --> 02:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
liquidate positions we have to liquidate
 
02:29:32.961 --> 02:29:32.971 align:start position:0%
securities and that is the securities I
 
02:29:34.671 --> 02:29:34.681 align:start position:0%
get liquidated those go to the general
 
02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:37.610 align:start position:0%
fund the hard part of this is that
 
02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:40.410 align:start position:0%
obviously when we start doing this
 
02:29:44.001 --> 02:29:44.011 align:start position:0%
process of liquidating the Securities we
 
02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:49.050 align:start position:0%
start this process around March and then
 
02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:50.610 align:start position:0%
we continue that process all the way
 
02:29:53.690 --> 02:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
through before June so we are able to do
 
02:29:57.560 --> 02:29:57.570 align:start position:0%
that calculation this year when we
 
02:29:59.810 --> 02:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
started looking at the what was being
 
02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:04.290 align:start position:0%
liquidated we stock market had a decline
 
02:30:07.580 --> 02:30:07.590 align:start position:0%
of 20% we had those hard days in march
 
02:30:12.551 --> 02:30:12.561 align:start position:0%
and fortunately the stock market every
 
02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:17.190 align:start position:0%
recover somewhat but but we had to so
 
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's really the decline for this year
 
02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:22.410 align:start position:0%
with what we were thinking and in in in
 
02:30:25.370 --> 02:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
every year we is because that's a hard
 
02:30:29.511 --> 02:30:29.521 align:start position:0%
number to predict what we do is we in
 
02:30:31.310 --> 02:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
order to prepare an estimate we just
 
02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
take a ten-year
 
02:30:34.310 --> 02:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
average and we just put in the
 
02:30:36.860 --> 02:30:36.870 align:start position:0%
calculation so the numbers that we put
 
02:30:39.620 --> 02:30:39.630 align:start position:0%
in for fiscal year 20 and fiscal year 21
 
02:30:42.530 --> 02:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
are based on the ten-year average that
 
02:30:45.530 --> 02:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
we maintain but we don't know how the
 
02:30:47.421 --> 02:30:47.431 align:start position:0%
stock market is going to be performing
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
at the time that we need to liquidate
 
02:30:52.970 --> 02:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
those securities so this year we had a
 
02:30:54.860 --> 02:30:54.870 align:start position:0%
little bit I'm gonna call it a loss but
 
02:30:58.940 --> 02:30:58.950 align:start position:0%
I guess it wasn't spotted as it was in
 
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
previous years for example 2018-2019 we
 
02:31:05.890 --> 02:31:05.900 align:start position:0%
had some good proceeds from those sales
 
02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:08.370 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this year we had to you
 
02:31:11.570 --> 02:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
know that wasn't as positive and and
 
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's why those numbers this year are
 
02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:16.650 align:start position:0%
looking like that so we had them an
 
02:31:25.850 --> 02:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
estimate of numbers when you have on
 
02:31:28.100 --> 02:31:28.110 align:start position:0%
your sheet that was provided by the
 
02:31:32.330 --> 02:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
controller we have we went down to a
 
02:31:37.841 --> 02:31:37.851 align:start position:0%
point a million from 14 point 1 million
 
02:31:43.640 --> 02:31:43.650 align:start position:0%
the the in for fiscal year 21 again we
 
02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:46.410 align:start position:0%
just we just adjusted dot a little bit
 
02:31:49.610 --> 02:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
so we kept it at 17 million seventeen
 
02:31:51.770 --> 02:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
point three million just because again
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
we don't know how the stock market is
 
02:31:55.390 --> 02:31:55.400 align:start position:0%
gonna be performing a year from now and
 
02:31:57.860 --> 02:31:57.870 align:start position:0%
and we don't die in the market you know
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
our policy is not to try to predict a
 
02:32:02.360 --> 02:32:02.370 align:start position:0%
market or anything like that again we
 
02:32:04.460 --> 02:32:04.470 align:start position:0%
just we just follow policy we sell the
 
02:32:06.740 --> 02:32:06.750 align:start position:0%
securities the time that we do it every
 
02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:08.790 align:start position:0%
year and there's some good ears and
 
02:32:11.020 --> 02:32:11.030 align:start position:0%
there others not so much
 
02:32:13.790 --> 02:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
overall our goal is in our mission is to
 
02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:15.990 align:start position:0%
return the funds to the rightful owner
 
02:32:19.160 --> 02:32:19.170 align:start position:0%
but again since the law allows us to to
 
02:32:21.261 --> 02:32:21.271 align:start position:0%
those funds that we weren't able to
 
02:32:22.881 --> 02:32:22.891 align:start position:0%
return them we were able to escheat
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
include general funds so that's the
 
02:32:27.620 --> 02:32:27.630 align:start position:0%
story there I don't know if you will you
 
02:32:29.841 --> 02:32:29.851 align:start position:0%
have any additional questions related to
 
02:32:29.851 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
have any additional questions related to
that

02:32:31.359 --> 02:32:31.369 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:32:34.689 --> 02:32:34.699 align:start position:0%
thank you I just like to say that if I
 
02:32:38.620 --> 02:32:38.630 align:start position:0%
have a surface ten years later after you
 
02:32:41.109 --> 02:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
you're the cheated and say hey that was
 
02:32:46.090 --> 02:32:46.100 align:start position:0%
mine I believe that you pay it out of
 
02:32:49.030 --> 02:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
the general fund through through
 
02:32:52.179 --> 02:32:52.189 align:start position:0%
governor and council we do we do so the
 
02:32:55.870 --> 02:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
law allows to return the funds anytime
 
02:32:57.969 --> 02:32:57.979 align:start position:0%
even if it's been ten years like you
 
02:33:00.370 --> 02:33:00.380 align:start position:0%
said so we we go we go to Governing
 
02:33:02.139 --> 02:33:02.149 align:start position:0%
Council or request those funds and we
 
02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:04.130 align:start position:0%
and we typically play those those those
 
02:33:07.620 --> 02:33:07.630 align:start position:0%
funds to the rightful owner thank you
 
02:33:10.109 --> 02:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:33:13.030 --> 02:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
anything else you'd like to say about
 
02:33:16.149 --> 02:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
this I think we covered everything
 
02:33:21.880 --> 02:33:21.890 align:start position:0%
that's on this sheet thank you very much
 
02:33:30.370 --> 02:33:30.380 align:start position:0%
Monica you too Chris I don't know if you
 
02:33:34.269 --> 02:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
could help us with this there there seem
 
02:33:42.819 --> 02:33:42.829 align:start position:0%
to be maybe six eight funds that were
 
02:33:46.599 --> 02:33:46.609 align:start position:0%
among the bigger funds that they usually
 
02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:50.810 align:start position:0%
analyze that have moved to restricted
 
02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:55.010 align:start position:0%
funds by the budget are you talking
 
02:33:59.080 --> 02:33:59.090 align:start position:0%
about the other funds the engineers
 
02:34:02.969 --> 02:34:02.979 align:start position:0%
forms the electrician's boards the
 
02:34:10.479 --> 02:34:10.489 align:start position:0%
permits so a number of funds that the
 
02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:13.790 align:start position:0%
Joint Board or the what used to be the
 
02:34:17.740 --> 02:34:17.750 align:start position:0%
Joint Board is names like Oh PLC used to
 
02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
be generally funded and two sessions ago
 
02:34:24.729 --> 02:34:24.739 align:start position:0%
it was the legislature decided to make
 
02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:27.290 align:start position:0%
those are restricted fund so now all
 
02:34:29.170 --> 02:34:29.180 align:start position:0%
that money goes directly to the fund
 
02:34:32.290 --> 02:34:32.300 align:start position:0%
pays all the bills of the opt throughout
 
02:34:33.729 --> 02:34:33.739 align:start position:0%
year which is where all the board's are
 
02:34:36.130 --> 02:34:36.140 align:start position:0%
located now and then at the end of the
 
02:34:38.229 --> 02:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
year they will lapse any surplus and
 
02:34:44.060 --> 02:34:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:48.290 --> 02:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
huh so it does lapse at some point but
 
02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:50.310 align:start position:0%
safety managed to hold on to the
 
02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:53.130 align:start position:0%
plumbers board somehow where there were
 
02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:54.810 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of wards for
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
different reasons that didn't get
 
02:34:59.960 --> 02:34:59.970 align:start position:0%
grouped under the O PLC I can't actually
 
02:35:02.330 --> 02:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
speak to the reasons because I don't
 
02:35:03.530 --> 02:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
know I'm not aware of what they are but
 
02:35:05.390 --> 02:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
they're worse than that there was
 
02:35:10.030 --> 02:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
decisions made not to group them right
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay so I think that we're suckers we
 
02:35:20.810 --> 02:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
usually are in this in just accepting
 
02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:24.210 align:start position:0%
the numbers that the Commissioner of das
 
02:35:27.890 --> 02:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
comes up with or for other revenue
 
02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:33.090 align:start position:0%
sources because one of them varies in
 
02:35:34.990 --> 02:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
different directions for special reasons
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
and most of all me just so that to
 
02:35:39.290 --> 02:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
remind the committee I mean the
 
02:35:41.540 --> 02:35:41.550 align:start position:0%
Comptroller does work with the agencies
 
02:35:44.511 --> 02:35:44.521 align:start position:0%
that collect that revenue to sort of you
 
02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:47.490 align:start position:0%
know if there is an up or down related
 
02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:50.370 align:start position:0%
to that so just the Comptroller you know
 
02:35:51.980 --> 02:35:51.990 align:start position:0%
doing it all on her own with her staff
 
02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:54.930 align:start position:0%
there is a some work done with the
 
02:35:56.300 --> 02:35:56.310 align:start position:0%
agencies that are responsible for
 
02:35:57.890 --> 02:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
collecting those revenue sources in that
 
02:36:06.530 --> 02:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
other category yes okay so I guess I
 
02:36:08.540 --> 02:36:08.550 align:start position:0%
hadn't asked that question since we got
 
02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
a comptroller so you don't have several
 
02:36:21.410 --> 02:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
agency people that are of questions you
 
02:36:23.020 --> 02:36:23.030 align:start position:0%
might have
 
02:36:27.710 --> 02:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
very glendan is there well Barry Glennon
 
02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:29.970 align:start position:0%
whose names the Securities Bureau is
 
02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:33.810 align:start position:0%
available from HHS if you want to talk
 
02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:41.490 align:start position:0%
about Medicaid recoveries revenue and
 
02:36:43.430 --> 02:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
then transportation is available if you
 
02:36:45.410 --> 02:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
had any questions related to their they
 
02:36:46.970 --> 02:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
have a small piece of the highway fund
 
02:36:49.460 --> 02:36:49.470 align:start position:0%
yes about two hundred thousand dollars
 
02:36:51.590 --> 02:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
but earlier there were questions about
 
02:36:53.630 --> 02:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
traffic flow and and things like that
 
02:36:56.511 --> 02:36:56.521 align:start position:0%
that application puts a lot of those
 
02:36:57.870 --> 02:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
types of reports together
 
02:36:59.790 --> 02:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
so I just want to let the committee know
 
02:37:01.950 --> 02:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
we have still agency people that are
 
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
available that questions you might have
 
02:37:09.149 --> 02:37:09.159 align:start position:0%
okay and we don't have anyone from the
 
02:37:11.550 --> 02:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice about the tobacco
 
02:37:15.389 --> 02:37:15.399 align:start position:0%
settlement not today no he did he did
 
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
submit a letter memo the that I see did
 
02:37:23.189 --> 02:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about what seems to be
 
02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:27.010 align:start position:0%
an apparent increase again in cigarettes
 
02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
but we won't know for a while so it's
 
02:37:36.229 --> 02:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's pretty proper than that he's not
 
02:37:39.530 --> 02:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
speculating on it I guess
 
02:37:39.540 --> 02:37:40.939 align:start position:0%
speculating on it I guess
[Music]

02:37:40.939 --> 02:37:40.949 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:50.370 --> 02:37:50.380 align:start position:0%
they've had some delay in revenues
 
02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:53.290 align:start position:0%
because of the kovat pandemic but they
 
02:37:58.080 --> 02:37:58.090 align:start position:0%
expect to get to regular operations in
 
02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:02.170 align:start position:0%
June and meet the plan and their
 
02:38:05.849 --> 02:38:05.859 align:start position:0%
projections for the next year remain the
 
02:38:07.950 --> 02:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
same I don't know if anyone wants to ask
 
02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:13.330 align:start position:0%
about the likelihood that there will be
 
02:38:16.740 --> 02:38:16.750 align:start position:0%
as many securities people out there when
 
02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:19.290 align:start position:0%
we get through this as there are were in
 
02:38:23.250 --> 02:38:23.260 align:start position:0%
January which I believe is what their
 
02:38:25.769 --> 02:38:25.779 align:start position:0%
revenues are basically most of their
 
02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:29.890 align:start position:0%
revenues are based on his securities
 
02:38:36.470 --> 02:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
no questions we can go forward uh but
 
02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:47.670 align:start position:0%
you're said representative of Romney has
 
02:38:52.700 --> 02:38:52.710 align:start position:0%
a question absolutely bro me sure you
 
02:38:54.680 --> 02:38:54.690 align:start position:0%
said there was no change and I'm looking
 
02:38:57.740 --> 02:38:57.750 align:start position:0%
at a summary sheet and Felicia went down
 
02:38:59.600 --> 02:38:59.610 align:start position:0%
securities went down two million their
 
02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:01.590 align:start position:0%
projections from forty five to forty
 
02:39:06.350 --> 02:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
three and a slight reduction about 1.3
 
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
million reduction for next year so if
 
02:39:13.970 --> 02:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
that's different than what's on the
 
02:39:20.690 --> 02:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
sheet you're looking at then the actual
 
02:39:34.131 --> 02:39:34.141 align:start position:0%
numbers in one place there he can he can
 
02:39:49.580 --> 02:39:49.590 align:start position:0%
respond to that yes are you there yes
 
02:39:59.150 --> 02:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
serious our plan to the planet that came
 
02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
from das now the plan of the plan that
 
02:40:07.700 --> 02:40:07.710 align:start position:0%
was in the budget was for forty five
 
02:40:12.290 --> 02:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
million in twenty and forty four point
 
02:40:16.820 --> 02:40:16.830 align:start position:0%
three in twenty one and you're speaking
 
02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:21.170 align:start position:0%
to another different plan which is for
 
02:40:26.570 --> 02:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
forty three million into ID and forty
 
02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
three million in twenty one looks like
 
02:40:33.410 --> 02:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
we're having some issues with him being
 
02:40:41.421 --> 02:40:41.431 align:start position:0%
able to speak but what I if I could dare
 
02:40:45.770 --> 02:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
to speak based on the memory
 
02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:48.610 align:start position:0%
the securities provided estimates to the
 
02:40:50.820 --> 02:40:50.830 align:start position:0%
ways and means a year ago when you were
 
02:40:53.131 --> 02:40:53.141 align:start position:0%
building the budget numbers were lower
 
02:40:55.051 --> 02:40:55.061 align:start position:0%
than the numbers that were agreed to by
 
02:40:56.551 --> 02:40:56.561 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
02:40:59.761 --> 02:40:59.771 align:start position:0%
I believe that's what he is basing his
 
02:41:01.261 --> 02:41:01.271 align:start position:0%
estimate he says the estimate didn't
 
02:41:02.970 --> 02:41:02.980 align:start position:0%
change yeah
 
02:41:04.850 --> 02:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
originally provided the committee's
 
02:41:07.890 --> 02:41:07.900 align:start position:0%
right not what the legislature finally
 
02:41:11.820 --> 02:41:11.830 align:start position:0%
agreed to but so we can figure out how
 
02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:15.250 align:start position:0%
to get him to speak yes I think he might
 
02:41:18.390 --> 02:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
be able to now if you are you I'll stop
 
02:41:20.551 --> 02:41:20.561 align:start position:0%
talking Barry can you hear me now
 
02:41:22.410 --> 02:41:22.420 align:start position:0%
Christopher yes we can Barry
 
02:41:24.570 --> 02:41:24.580 align:start position:0%
okay no reverberation or anything like
 
02:41:27.810 --> 02:41:27.820 align:start position:0%
that nope okay great so I don't know if
 
02:41:29.370 --> 02:41:29.380 align:start position:0%
you heard what I just said I was
 
02:41:31.890 --> 02:41:31.900 align:start position:0%
basically suggesting you did hear okay
 
02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:35.590 align:start position:0%
yes in fact that then that would account
 
02:41:38.190 --> 02:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
for the difference the legislature had
 
02:41:41.370 --> 02:41:41.380 align:start position:0%
put it in net around 45 our testimony
 
02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:44.130 align:start position:0%
before which means has been consistent
 
02:41:49.950 --> 02:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
protecting 43 3 3 but we have
 
02:41:53.930 --> 02:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
experienced a slight reduction as
 
02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:56.470 align:start position:0%
indicated in my mouth to representative
 
02:42:00.091 --> 02:42:00.101 align:start position:0%
alley there is there has been some
 
02:42:02.220 --> 02:42:02.230 align:start position:0%
impact with respect to phobic 19
 
02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:05.050 align:start position:0%
pandemic delaying some of the agent
 
02:42:08.370 --> 02:42:08.380 align:start position:0%
testing as well as a delay with regard
 
02:42:11.460 --> 02:42:11.470 align:start position:0%
to some of the hardcopy mutual fund
 
02:42:13.650 --> 02:42:13.660 align:start position:0%
filers which is really a significant
 
02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:16.570 align:start position:0%
source but I'm still confident though
 
02:42:20.190 --> 02:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
that if business resumes in June if New
 
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
York and Chicago and some of the major
 
02:42:26.220 --> 02:42:26.230 align:start position:0%
cities and large farms open up coffee
 
02:42:30.421 --> 02:42:30.431 align:start position:0%
filers performing in June when I say
 
02:42:31.980 --> 02:42:31.990 align:start position:0%
performing I mean actually getting back
 
02:42:34.740 --> 02:42:34.750 align:start position:0%
to business and forwarding those fees to
 
02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:37.570 align:start position:0%
us that's been a major issue for a lot
 
02:42:39.900 --> 02:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
of the firms that they have the ability
 
02:42:41.190 --> 02:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
to work from home but to be able to
 
02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:43.110 align:start position:0%
actually request checks and issue checks
 
02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:46.570 align:start position:0%
has been an impediment for them so
 
02:42:50.671 --> 02:42:50.681 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm hopeful that we will it's
 
02:42:50.681 --> 02:42:54.860 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm hopeful that we will it's
projected

02:42:54.860 --> 02:42:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.170 --> 02:43:01.180 align:start position:0%
thank you this has been a problem with
 
02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:07.770 align:start position:0%
it for a couple of agencies in a lot of
 
02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
terms that the legislature does increase
 
02:43:18.870 --> 02:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers at the last minute and those
 
02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:21.610 align:start position:0%
are the ones that that were operating
 
02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:26.350 align:start position:0%
off of and it's quite proper and I've
 
02:43:31.110 --> 02:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
heard a number of other times very early
 
02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:42.130 align:start position:0%
on you also have to to say okay go on
 
02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:43.990 align:start position:0%
the official estimate which is the
 
02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:53.290 align:start position:0%
budget estimate so yeah clear and I do
 
02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:01.450 align:start position:0%
apologize no that's legislature that
 
02:44:07.430 --> 02:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:10.590 --> 02:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
any further questions on representative
 
02:44:14.670 --> 02:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
rice thank you madam chair I it's not a
 
02:44:16.410 --> 02:44:16.420 align:start position:0%
question pertaining to this I just need
 
02:44:18.270 --> 02:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
to let you go I have to leave this
 
02:44:20.010 --> 02:44:20.020 align:start position:0%
meeting because I have another meeting I

have to be on now okay okay but thank
 
02:44:26.730 --> 02:44:26.740 align:start position:0%

02:44:44.930 --> 02:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
you too so thanks represent follow me
 
02:44:47.969 --> 02:44:47.979 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services could talk to
 
02:44:50.460 --> 02:44:50.470 align:start position:0%
recoveries but we didn't get anything
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
from recoveries except what you put in
 
02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:00.010 align:start position:0%
the chart represent of all me yes I did
 
02:45:01.650 --> 02:45:01.660 align:start position:0%
get an email from the fishing game
 
02:45:01.660 --> 02:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
get an email from the fishing game
uh-huh

02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:02.890 align:start position:0%
uh-huh
 
02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:04.750 align:start position:0%
by 4 o'clock so I don't know if there's
 
02:45:06.511 --> 02:45:06.521 align:start position:0%
any questions you have for them
 
02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:08.590 align:start position:0%
yes there's one to the comment you were
 
02:45:11.330 --> 02:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
just going to make yeah I would like to
 
02:45:14.850 --> 02:45:14.860 align:start position:0%
so you have director Norman DOE and
 
02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:19.570 align:start position:0%
Kathy Labonte right I think they may be
 
02:45:24.770 --> 02:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:27.830 --> 02:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
gather from looking at the report that
 
02:45:34.711 --> 02:45:34.721 align:start position:0%
they sense that they have somewhere in
 
02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
their revenues I guess in miscellaneous
 
02:45:39.150 --> 02:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
sales and income they put the grants
 
02:45:41.551 --> 02:45:41.561 align:start position:0%
that they get and they they've managed
 
02:45:46.711 --> 02:45:46.721 align:start position:0%
to get two grants that show up in the
 
02:45:50.131 --> 02:45:50.141 align:start position:0%
revenues football are remarkably healthy
 
02:45:53.430 --> 02:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
for fishing game I don't understand
 
02:45:56.900 --> 02:45:56.910 align:start position:0%
about the two grants do you hear me yes
 
02:46:00.060 --> 02:46:00.070 align:start position:0%
well we did was we had a sale of one of
 
02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:06.010 align:start position:0%
our properties mm-hmm that sale went
 
02:46:07.740 --> 02:46:07.750 align:start position:0%
which went through long-range planning
 
02:46:13.500 --> 02:46:13.510 align:start position:0%
and and G and C the the revenue from
 
02:46:19.290 --> 02:46:19.300 align:start position:0%
that five hundred and five hundred and
 
02:46:21.150 --> 02:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
thirty six thousand dollars is being
 
02:46:23.671 --> 02:46:23.681 align:start position:0%
used to match a million dollar grant
 
02:46:31.140 --> 02:46:31.150 align:start position:0%
from NOAA which means that grant which
 
02:46:35.250 --> 02:46:35.260 align:start position:0%
is not represented and we have won that
 
02:46:39.900 --> 02:46:39.910 align:start position:0%
grant to do a significant amount of work
 
02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:42.490 align:start position:0%
on a large property we own on Great Bay
 
02:46:46.171 --> 02:46:46.181 align:start position:0%
as part of the Great Bay research
 
02:46:53.211 --> 02:46:53.221 align:start position:0%
reserve and we put it in a high light
 
02:46:56.970 --> 02:46:56.980 align:start position:0%
because we had the we put the revenue
 
02:46:59.280 --> 02:46:59.290 align:start position:0%
from that sale in that miscellaneous
 
02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:02.290 align:start position:0%
sales and income line and wanted people
 
02:47:07.890 --> 02:47:07.900 align:start position:0%
to understand what that large not was as
 
02:47:13.171 --> 02:47:13.181 align:start position:0%
it is unusual so the revenue is in the
 
02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:17.890 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous sales but the NOAA grant
 
02:47:23.849 --> 02:47:23.859 align:start position:0%
and and park acquisition I guess and
 
02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:29.770 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up acquisition well I'm
 
02:47:33.540 --> 02:47:33.550 align:start position:0%
trying to remember the national estuary
 
02:47:36.530 --> 02:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
and research reserve procurement
 
02:47:45.929 --> 02:47:45.939 align:start position:0%
acquisition and construction I thought
 
02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:51.850 align:start position:0%
it was for using the game farm for
 
02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:52.930 align:start position:0%
something or other
 
02:47:58.820 --> 02:47:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:02.809 --> 02:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
we sold the game farm in Brentwood
 
02:48:05.219 --> 02:48:05.229 align:start position:0%
thinking of funds that we got from that
 
02:48:10.590 --> 02:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
sale for a major renovation project on a
 
02:48:15.330 --> 02:48:15.340 align:start position:0%
piece in Greenland acres in here with
 
02:48:28.620 --> 02:48:28.630 align:start position:0%
over three thousand be done you've got
 
02:48:32.630 --> 02:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
the you've got the revenue in here a
 
02:48:35.849 --> 02:48:35.859 align:start position:0%
surplus revenue but it's actually been
 
02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:37.870 align:start position:0%
spent on something that is being spent
 
02:48:41.070 --> 02:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
in the expenditure category well it
 
02:48:43.019 --> 02:48:43.029 align:start position:0%
hasn't been spent yet it's just sitting
 
02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:47.770 align:start position:0%
here penalty pending contracts and all
 
02:48:49.889 --> 02:48:49.899 align:start position:0%
the other things that have to go on to
 
02:48:55.349 --> 02:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
expend it but it is you're marked by us
 
02:49:01.439 --> 02:49:01.449 align:start position:0%
for that project which is the only
 
02:49:05.010 --> 02:49:05.020 align:start position:0%
reason why it went through long-range
 
02:49:08.660 --> 02:49:08.670 align:start position:0%
planning and G and C because otherwise
 
02:49:11.399 --> 02:49:11.409 align:start position:0%
we don't dispose the state properties
 
02:49:23.930 --> 02:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:28.620 --> 02:49:28.630 align:start position:0%
okay represented malooley has a question
 
02:49:35.790 --> 02:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
the melanopsin malloy ab cinema why I'm
 
02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:41.110 align:start position:0%
here yes thank you I just want to weigh
 
02:49:44.940 --> 02:49:44.950 align:start position:0%
in on this this I've no comment about
 
02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:48.970 align:start position:0%
the money here but I just want to say
 
02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:52.330 align:start position:0%
that this is a huge deal the purchase of
 
02:49:56.190 --> 02:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
this and vast improvement of an area
 
02:50:02.270 --> 02:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:04.330 align:start position:0%
there's some work that's gonna need to
 
02:50:07.261 --> 02:50:07.271 align:start position:0%
be done as we remediation but a great
 
02:50:09.330 --> 02:50:09.340 align:start position:0%
great resource and I want to commend the
 
02:50:12.750 --> 02:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game and everybody for weighing
 
02:50:14.790 --> 02:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
in on this and making this happen this
 
02:50:18.091 --> 02:50:18.101 align:start position:0%
is this is a terrific resource for the
 
02:50:22.290 --> 02:50:22.300 align:start position:0%
Great Bay are pretty opens when we can
 
02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:26.290 align:start position:0%
really get we went there I think the
 
02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:30.130 align:start position:0%
public is just gonna eat it up it is
 
02:50:34.820 --> 02:50:34.830 align:start position:0%
it's got a beautiful spot beautiful spot
 
02:50:46.670 --> 02:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you the other page why why would
 
02:50:50.970 --> 02:50:50.980 align:start position:0%
underfunded road tolls for off-highway
 
02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:00.490 align:start position:0%
vehicles and marine next year because
 
02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:05.650 align:start position:0%
we're we looked at them and in in recent
 
02:51:11.940 --> 02:51:11.950 align:start position:0%
years those numbers represent what we've
 
02:51:13.460 --> 02:51:13.470 align:start position:0%
been getting
 
02:51:17.580 --> 02:51:17.590 align:start position:0%
here is the 700 and 800 based on
 
02:51:19.530 --> 02:51:19.540 align:start position:0%
long-term averages but over the last
 
02:51:24.210 --> 02:51:24.220 align:start position:0%
couple years with more boats and more
 
02:51:28.460 --> 02:51:28.470 align:start position:0%
especially Morro HRVs
 
02:51:31.591 --> 02:51:31.601 align:start position:0%
revenues have consistently been in the
 
02:51:34.761 --> 02:51:34.771 align:start position:0%
range that we're projecting here
 
02:51:37.410 --> 02:51:37.420 align:start position:0%
and so we've met we're maintained
 
02:51:40.110 --> 02:51:40.120 align:start position:0%
we're just bringing we're bringing
 
02:51:44.460 --> 02:51:44.470 align:start position:0%
projection in line with what history is
 
02:51:52.860 --> 02:51:52.870 align:start position:0%
saying is going on you have increases
 
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
next year in this year too so what is it
 
02:52:43.889 --> 02:52:43.899 align:start position:0%
what's the static property Sandy Point
 
02:52:49.019 --> 02:52:49.029 align:start position:0%
yeah every Center no the the Greenland
 
02:52:52.290 --> 02:52:52.300 align:start position:0%
property is just up the up the shoreline
 
02:52:57.960 --> 02:52:57.970 align:start position:0%
from the Portsmouth country okay but in
 
02:53:01.889 --> 02:53:01.899 align:start position:0%
terms of the licenses looks like you're
 
02:53:04.349 --> 02:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
projecting pretty much what you had
 
02:53:07.290 --> 02:53:07.300 align:start position:0%
projected Manny's right uptick yeah well
 
02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know if we have hopes that the
 
02:53:19.469 --> 02:53:19.479 align:start position:0%
licenses will be up going 21 however you
 
02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:20.890 align:start position:0%
know we're in this very special
 
02:53:24.149 --> 02:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
circumstance right here where we've had
 
02:53:28.110 --> 02:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
really huge increases in our fishing
 
02:53:31.250 --> 02:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
licenses which is you know not to be
 
02:53:33.510 --> 02:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
unexpected when you look at nobody could
 
02:53:35.550 --> 02:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
even go out and play baseball but they
 
02:53:37.740 --> 02:53:37.750 align:start position:0%
could still go fishing so all of the
 
02:53:41.280 --> 02:53:41.290 align:start position:0%
normal spring sport stuff is pretty much
 
02:53:43.260 --> 02:53:43.270 align:start position:0%
shut down but people could still go
 
02:53:47.340 --> 02:53:47.350 align:start position:0%
fishing and they are going fishing so
 
02:53:50.411 --> 02:53:50.421 align:start position:0%
we're happy to
 
02:53:55.930 --> 02:53:55.940 align:start position:0%
to take those fees and I certainly hope
 
02:53:58.121 --> 02:53:58.131 align:start position:0%
that if some people maybe have come back
 
02:54:01.270 --> 02:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
into it they will continue but I would
 
02:54:04.331 --> 02:54:04.341 align:start position:0%
not bet the house on the fact that it
 
02:54:08.741 --> 02:54:08.751 align:start position:0%
will be the same way next spring when
 
02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:11.450 align:start position:0%
potentially all the normal activities
 
02:54:15.701 --> 02:54:15.711 align:start position:0%
back and play fishing license have a
 
02:54:18.911 --> 02:54:18.921 align:start position:0%
notoriously high wash factor or often
 
02:54:23.440 --> 02:54:23.450 align:start position:0%
people will buy them you know two out of
 
02:54:25.810 --> 02:54:25.820 align:start position:0%
every five years or whatever there's
 
02:54:29.621 --> 02:54:29.631 align:start position:0%
there's less consistency with the same
 
02:54:32.741 --> 02:54:32.751 align:start position:0%
person always buying fishing licenses
 
02:54:38.381 --> 02:54:38.391 align:start position:0%
overall so you know we we're optimistic
 
02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:40.730 align:start position:0%
but you know we really don't want to
 
02:54:45.461 --> 02:54:45.471 align:start position:0%
extrapolate the conditions were in right
 
02:54:52.001 --> 02:54:52.011 align:start position:0%
now to the too far into the future thank
 
02:54:52.011 --> 02:54:52.390 align:start position:0%
now to the too far into the future thank
you

02:54:52.390 --> 02:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:54:57.611 --> 02:54:57.621 align:start position:0%
right the world
 
02:54:59.831 --> 02:54:59.841 align:start position:0%
they probably hope our fishing license
 
02:55:01.781 --> 02:55:01.791 align:start position:0%
sales go down because that may mean
 
02:55:13.661 --> 02:55:13.671 align:start position:0%
we're getting so which spring turkey
 
02:55:18.281 --> 02:55:18.291 align:start position:0%
hunting really may we had record turkey
 
02:55:29.621 --> 02:55:29.631 align:start position:0%
license sales also great okay so so
 
02:55:31.661 --> 02:55:31.671 align:start position:0%
you'd like this to continue until the
 
02:55:37.091 --> 02:55:37.101 align:start position:0%
deer season well actually we have a
 
02:55:40.781 --> 02:55:40.791 align:start position:0%
little problem in that well that would
 
02:55:44.861 --> 02:55:44.871 align:start position:0%
be great we're also being stymied in our
 
02:55:47.581 --> 02:55:47.591 align:start position:0%
hunter ed classes because of all of the
 
02:55:50.051 --> 02:55:50.061 align:start position:0%
restrictions and whatnot so we have a
 
02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:54.610 align:start position:0%
backlog of of folks want hunter ed
 
02:55:58.180 --> 02:55:58.190 align:start position:0%
certification and we really have not got
 
02:56:01.810 --> 02:56:01.820 align:start position:0%
a great way to to deal with it so they
 
02:56:03.881 --> 02:56:03.891 align:start position:0%
can they can take the program
 
02:56:05.470 --> 02:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
on line but they still need to do a
 
02:56:12.341 --> 02:56:12.351 align:start position:0%
field a day of field activity and we're
 
02:56:18.310 --> 02:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
hoping to be able to accommodate with a
 
02:56:23.531 --> 02:56:23.541 align:start position:0%
with a full-out effort in August but we
 
02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:25.070 align:start position:0%
probably are still going to be highly
 
02:56:27.251 --> 02:56:27.261 align:start position:0%
limited in the number of people per
 
02:56:30.251 --> 02:56:30.261 align:start position:0%
class that we can happen in play so I'm
 
02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:33.530 align:start position:0%
not sure they'll probably be some
 
02:56:38.201 --> 02:56:38.211 align:start position:0%
constituent unhappiness as that plays
 
02:56:42.491 --> 02:56:42.501 align:start position:0%
out but absent some changes in the in
 
02:56:47.861 --> 02:56:47.871 align:start position:0%
the numbers allowed for gathering at all
 
02:56:52.980 --> 02:56:52.990 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.001 --> 02:56:58.011 align:start position:0%
thank you well I think that that looks
 
02:57:01.541 --> 02:57:01.551 align:start position:0%
pretty good for you this year yeah we're
 
02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:16.730 align:start position:0%
we're lucky right okay thank you thank
 
02:57:22.321 --> 02:57:22.331 align:start position:0%
you we have two other small pieces on
 
02:57:24.690 --> 02:57:24.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:57:27.161 --> 02:57:27.171 align:start position:0%
apparently she's been waiting around to
 
02:57:30.301 --> 02:57:30.311 align:start position:0%
talk to us about Medicaid recoveries
 
02:57:33.281 --> 02:57:33.291 align:start position:0%
which was available for questions if you
 
02:57:37.150 --> 02:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
had available for questions right and if
 
02:57:40.180 --> 02:57:40.190 align:start position:0%
karen downes um who's available to talk
 
02:57:48.791 --> 02:57:48.801 align:start position:0%
to you well is everybody okay the
 
02:57:51.341 --> 02:57:51.351 align:start position:0%
estimate for Medicaid recoveries you're
 
02:57:55.321 --> 02:57:55.331 align:start position:0%
recovering from the estates of people
 
02:58:02.921 --> 02:58:02.931 align:start position:0%
mostly and at this particular time there
 
02:58:04.991 --> 02:58:05.001 align:start position:0%
is likely to be less money out there to
 
02:58:08.171 --> 02:58:08.181 align:start position:0%
recover I don't know if that's a good
 
02:58:14.281 --> 02:58:14.291 align:start position:0%
way of synthesizing that one but but
 
02:58:17.430 --> 02:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
maybe we could go on
 
02:58:20.490 --> 02:58:20.500 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation which I
 
02:58:24.900 --> 02:58:24.910 align:start position:0%
don't think sent us anything except the
 
02:58:29.001 --> 02:58:29.011 align:start position:0%
numbers that you have in here for
 
02:58:35.251 --> 02:58:35.261 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous in the highway fund so I
 
02:58:37.140 --> 02:58:37.150 align:start position:0%
had emailed Murray Mullin and she
 
02:58:39.980 --> 02:58:39.990 align:start position:0%
confirmed there was no changes mm-hmm
 
02:58:42.270 --> 02:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
she provided was just the turnpike
 
02:58:45.930 --> 02:58:45.940 align:start position:0%
report that was also again sent you huh
 
02:58:49.501 --> 02:58:49.511 align:start position:0%
I don't think I saw it turnpike record
 
02:58:51.060 --> 02:58:51.070 align:start position:0%
but we don't get to do the Turnpike's
 
02:58:55.440 --> 02:58:55.450 align:start position:0%
anyway so it was a traffic report I
 
02:58:59.131 --> 02:58:59.141 align:start position:0%
think there was the flow of traffic and
 
02:59:01.621 --> 02:59:01.631 align:start position:0%
what's been happening with the kovat and
 
02:59:09.360 --> 02:59:09.370 align:start position:0%
stay home orders everybody yesterday in
 
02:59:15.180 --> 02:59:15.190 align:start position:0%
case they wanted to see every week now
 
02:59:18.961 --> 02:59:18.971 align:start position:0%
coming up for closer to normal traffic
 
02:59:20.751 --> 02:59:20.761 align:start position:0%
it's still going to take us a while but
 
02:59:30.411 --> 02:59:30.421 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:40.411 --> 02:59:40.421 align:start position:0%
lost 2 to 35% 38% this last week yes the
 
02:59:42.541 --> 02:59:42.551 align:start position:0%
repo is on Turnpike tolls which of
 
02:59:45.661 --> 02:59:45.671 align:start position:0%
course is not all of African state right
 
02:59:47.070 --> 02:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
this is Murray Mullin from New Hampshire
 
02:59:51.360 --> 02:59:51.370 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation and yeah we
 
02:59:54.780 --> 02:59:54.790 align:start position:0%
we had a high of about a 57 percent
 
02:59:59.280 --> 02:59:59.290 align:start position:0%
decline in mid-april and as of Sunday
 
03:00:03.450 --> 03:00:03.460 align:start position:0%
that decline was at 38 percent so we
 
03:00:06.270 --> 03:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
have been gradually seeing some traffic
 
03:00:09.060 --> 03:00:09.070 align:start position:0%
coming back but we still are seeing
 
03:00:14.041 --> 03:00:14.051 align:start position:0%
significant declines over FY 19 over
 
03:00:17.310 --> 03:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
last year and you know we're going now
 
03:00:21.511 --> 03:00:21.521 align:start position:0%
into the summer season and that's where
 
03:00:25.801 --> 03:00:25.811 align:start position:0%
our transactions are highest so you know
 
03:00:27.421 --> 03:00:27.431 align:start position:0%
we're still anticipating that we're
 
03:00:31.051 --> 03:00:31.061 align:start position:0%
going to see significant declines
 
03:00:33.270 --> 03:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
over these next several months depending
 
03:00:36.810 --> 03:00:36.820 align:start position:0%
how things open up and whether folks can
 
03:00:39.990 --> 03:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
actually stay and and come into the
 
03:00:45.871 --> 03:00:45.881 align:start position:0%
state right it'll be interesting to see
 
03:00:49.220 --> 03:00:49.230 align:start position:0%
what the Memorial Day weekend looks like
 
03:00:52.740 --> 03:00:52.750 align:start position:0%
well that's through Sunday it was a 38
 
03:00:54.990 --> 03:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
percent decline so that would have been
 
03:00:59.490 --> 03:00:59.500 align:start position:0%
Friday Saturday Sunday mm-hmm so it did
 
03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:01.570 align:start position:0%
not include Monday but through Sunday
 
03:01:04.711 --> 03:01:04.721 align:start position:0%
there was a 38 percent so that's why the
 
03:01:06.990 --> 03:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
week before I think was around 43
 
03:01:10.501 --> 03:01:10.511 align:start position:0%
percent so we did see some traffic
 
03:01:13.291 --> 03:01:13.301 align:start position:0%
increase over that week with the holiday
 
03:01:16.291 --> 03:01:16.301 align:start position:0%
weekend but we are still seeing large
 
03:01:18.030 --> 03:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
declines in the transactions coming
 
03:01:24.841 --> 03:01:24.851 align:start position:0%
through the tolls yes okay are we still
 
03:01:27.440 --> 03:01:27.450 align:start position:0%
Manning on totals
 
03:01:34.020 --> 03:01:34.030 align:start position:0%
yes we well we meters we are Manning the
 
03:01:37.140 --> 03:01:37.150 align:start position:0%
the toll booths and the centers we are
 
03:01:39.001 --> 03:01:39.011 align:start position:0%
doing cash collections we are doing
 
03:01:41.270 --> 03:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
change now at one point we had stopped
 
03:01:44.310 --> 03:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
doing change we were doing exact change
 
03:01:46.470 --> 03:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
only to try to limit the touch points
 
03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:49.330 align:start position:0%
what for our for the customers and for
 
03:01:52.140 --> 03:01:52.150 align:start position:0%
our total attendance but we are doing
 
03:01:56.400 --> 03:01:56.410 align:start position:0%
change again and we do have all the cash
 
03:02:00.060 --> 03:02:00.070 align:start position:0%
lanes open that that are needed we did
 
03:02:02.881 --> 03:02:02.891 align:start position:0%
reduce the third shift so we went down
 
03:02:05.041 --> 03:02:05.051 align:start position:0%
due to the significant decrease in
 
03:02:07.650 --> 03:02:07.660 align:start position:0%
traffic we did go down to two shifts we
 
03:02:10.921 --> 03:02:10.931 align:start position:0%
had during the day between 5:00 a.m. and
 
03:02:15.331 --> 03:02:15.341 align:start position:0%
9:00 p.m. and we have not been staffing
 
03:02:17.430 --> 03:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
during the evening hours because the
 
03:02:20.820 --> 03:02:20.830 align:start position:0%
traffic had been so low and we were
 
03:02:22.921 --> 03:02:22.931 align:start position:0%
actually spending more on total
 
03:02:24.270 --> 03:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
attendance than we were collecting in
 
03:02:26.180 --> 03:02:26.190 align:start position:0%
revenue so we had made that decision
 
03:02:29.280 --> 03:02:29.290 align:start position:0%
back at the end of March to to move to
 
03:02:31.711 --> 03:02:31.721 align:start position:0%
two shifts to try to save some some
 
03:02:35.371 --> 03:02:35.381 align:start position:0%
money and for the safety but those folks
 
03:02:39.570 --> 03:02:39.580 align:start position:0%
that go through go through the back
 
03:02:41.430 --> 03:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
office system and have you know the
 
03:02:43.831 --> 03:02:43.841 align:start position:0%
license they get billed or they can do
 
03:02:44.620 --> 03:02:44.630 align:start position:0%
the seven data
 
03:02:46.090 --> 03:02:46.100 align:start position:0%
hey go online and do the seven-day to
 
03:02:50.469 --> 03:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
pay so we're still collecting and going
 
03:02:52.510 --> 03:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
after that that that revenue for those
 
03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:54.890 align:start position:0%
folks that were going through late in
 
03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:00.530 align:start position:0%
the evening thank you
 
03:03:03.880 --> 03:03:03.890 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
03:03:06.130 --> 03:03:06.140 align:start position:0%
transportation department about the
 
03:03:13.510 --> 03:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
revenues and I think I think that takes
 
03:03:15.490 --> 03:03:15.500 align:start position:0%
care of that thank you for waiting so
 
03:03:17.860 --> 03:03:17.870 align:start position:0%
long marine I hope you've been doing
 
03:03:24.429 --> 03:03:24.439 align:start position:0%
something else in the meantime other
 
03:03:26.010 --> 03:03:26.020 align:start position:0%
agencies too huh
 
03:03:31.450 --> 03:03:31.460 align:start position:0%
okay so I think that wraps up everything
 
03:03:38.230 --> 03:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
that that we had in front of us for
 
03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:41.450 align:start position:0%
those of us that are still awake right
 
03:03:44.410 --> 03:03:44.420 align:start position:0%
now I can see a few people nodding a
 
03:03:49.020 --> 03:03:49.030 align:start position:0%
little bit but we're going to the
 
03:03:50.980 --> 03:03:50.990 align:start position:0%
Republicans I think are gonna hold a
 
03:03:55.380 --> 03:03:55.390 align:start position:0%
caucus tomorrow representing major is
 
03:04:05.860 --> 03:04:05.870 align:start position:0%
muted at the moment there is yes and
 
03:04:09.400 --> 03:04:09.410 align:start position:0%
we're holding one Friday afternoon which
 
03:04:13.450 --> 03:04:13.460 align:start position:0%
gives us a chance to go and look at all
 
03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:16.010 align:start position:0%
these numbers and at the numbers that
 
03:04:21.700 --> 03:04:21.710 align:start position:0%
we've done before and trying to figure
 
03:04:23.440 --> 03:04:23.450 align:start position:0%
out where we are
 
03:04:25.780 --> 03:04:25.790 align:start position:0%
I don't know at this point if we're
 
03:04:30.990 --> 03:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
going to end up with a single estimate
 
03:04:38.350 --> 03:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
for those taxes or arrange but I think
 
03:04:40.770 --> 03:04:40.780 align:start position:0%
the committee's right that we ought to
 
03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:44.450 align:start position:0%
to see if we feel more comfortable with
 
03:04:51.450 --> 03:04:51.460 align:start position:0%
some kind of range even for for this
 
03:04:56.380 --> 03:04:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:00.770 --> 03:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
and then um absent major it sounded like
 
03:05:04.360 --> 03:05:04.370 align:start position:0%
you were trying to say something yes
 
03:05:08.540 --> 03:05:08.550 align:start position:0%
that was a question I have for you that
 
03:05:11.780 --> 03:05:11.790 align:start position:0%
we went through this today and just
 
03:05:15.230 --> 03:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
about everybody it was a number rather
 
03:05:20.300 --> 03:05:20.310 align:start position:0%
than a range yes range
 
03:05:30.530 --> 03:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
yes what is your plan for money well it
 
03:05:34.340 --> 03:05:34.350 align:start position:0%
depends on what we come back with from
 
03:05:38.060 --> 03:05:38.070 align:start position:0%
our two caucuses and I think you and I
 
03:05:43.730 --> 03:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
need to get together this weekend and/or
 
03:05:48.020 --> 03:05:48.030 align:start position:0%
send each other an email yeah and see
 
03:05:53.540 --> 03:05:53.550 align:start position:0%
where we are on these things a single
 
03:05:57.230 --> 03:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
number seems pretty difficult at this
 
03:06:03.130 --> 03:06:03.140 align:start position:0%
point a single number for 2020 Bobby
 
03:06:06.380 --> 03:06:06.390 align:start position:0%
it's something we could attempt right
 
03:06:09.290 --> 03:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
the trouble is the business taxes and
 
03:06:12.170 --> 03:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
they IND Texas we really don't know how
 
03:06:24.730 --> 03:06:24.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:32.140 --> 03:06:32.150 align:start position:0%
yeah I is there anyone else who wants to
 
03:06:37.070 --> 03:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
horn in on this before we well I'm sorry
 
03:06:39.290 --> 03:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
I said Patrick when his hand up he did
 
03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:53.150 --> 03:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to chime in I do
 
03:06:58.010 --> 03:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
think that for fiscal year 21 we should
 
03:07:03.320 --> 03:07:03.330 align:start position:0%
do a range and I'm not sure exactly how
 
03:07:07.551 --> 03:07:07.561 align:start position:0%
we do that but and also I think
 
03:07:10.341 --> 03:07:10.351 align:start position:0%
truth is for this fiscal year even
 
03:07:12.160 --> 03:07:12.170 align:start position:0%
though we're is very close to the end
 
03:07:17.751 --> 03:07:17.761 align:start position:0%
we've got two accounts that are it could
 
03:07:21.470 --> 03:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
come in very different ways and we just
 
03:07:24.650 --> 03:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
we don't know and to pretend that we do
 
03:07:28.820 --> 03:07:28.830 align:start position:0%
know with a single number I'm
 
03:07:32.751 --> 03:07:32.761 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable so I'd prefer to even it
 
03:07:36.490 --> 03:07:36.500 align:start position:0%
was just a variant from the norm that
 
03:07:40.341 --> 03:07:40.351 align:start position:0%
the DRA has given us say plus or minus
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
10 percent I don't know I'm just
 
03:07:45.830 --> 03:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
throwing that out in some way of
 
03:07:54.640 --> 03:07:54.650 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:58.461 --> 03:07:58.471 align:start position:0%
for the business taxes and interesting
 
03:08:00.680 --> 03:08:00.690 align:start position:0%
dividends especially since it's been
 
03:08:06.610 --> 03:08:06.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:14.301 --> 03:08:14.311 align:start position:0%
on that yeah it is also true that in
 
03:08:19.240 --> 03:08:19.250 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 there are a number of
 
03:08:22.970 --> 03:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
lines that are basically a single number
 
03:08:25.940 --> 03:08:25.950 align:start position:0%
of lines I think we don't have any extra
 
03:08:28.850 --> 03:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
information on most of them yeah
 
03:08:32.211 --> 03:08:32.221 align:start position:0%
probably not their intent to being to
 
03:08:38.600 --> 03:08:38.610 align:start position:0%
revise them later yeah yeah Sam I wonder
 
03:08:41.921 --> 03:08:41.931 align:start position:0%
if we could just ask Chris Shea on
 
03:08:44.620 --> 03:08:44.630 align:start position:0%
particularly interest in dividends and
 
03:08:52.220 --> 03:08:52.230 align:start position:0%
and the business taxes when they if if
 
03:08:55.551 --> 03:08:55.561 align:start position:0%
the biggest businesses for instance do
 
03:09:02.091 --> 03:09:02.101 align:start position:0%
as the DRA was saying and wait until
 
03:09:05.450 --> 03:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
they have finished their their federal
 
03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:10.410 align:start position:0%
returns which will be July 15th and then
 
03:09:13.370 --> 03:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
start giving it up on my mistakes we
 
03:09:15.801 --> 03:09:15.811 align:start position:0%
will see that money in late to life
 
03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:19.570 align:start position:0%
we're lucky and probably in August
 
03:09:24.120 --> 03:09:24.130 align:start position:0%
and they will what they they they
 
03:09:27.150 --> 03:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
capture that for the kaffir so it never
 
03:09:32.430 --> 03:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
shows up in the 21 money and it hasn't
 
03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:38.170 align:start position:0%
gotten into the 20 money so from our
 
03:09:41.600 --> 03:09:41.610 align:start position:0%
perspective it's just disappeared so
 
03:09:44.310 --> 03:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner Steph had mentioned that
 
03:09:46.020 --> 03:09:46.030 align:start position:0%
there's a 60-day window once the year
 
03:09:49.051 --> 03:09:49.061 align:start position:0%
closes that they'll look at the revenues
 
03:09:50.610 --> 03:09:50.620 align:start position:0%
come in to determine should they have
 
03:09:54.511 --> 03:09:54.521 align:start position:0%
been credited to just ended or is it
 
03:09:56.011 --> 03:09:56.021 align:start position:0%
okay to stay at the current fiscal year
 
03:09:58.680 --> 03:09:58.690 align:start position:0%
that they're in so you're correct you're
 
03:10:01.530 --> 03:10:01.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see it in your June reports you
 
03:10:03.690 --> 03:10:03.700 align:start position:0%
would just see it reflected in the
 
03:10:06.480 --> 03:10:06.490 align:start position:0%
kafir' if there was more revenue you'd
 
03:10:08.761 --> 03:10:08.771 align:start position:0%
see an increase in the business taxes
 
03:10:11.881 --> 03:10:11.891 align:start position:0%
once the kafir' you know and once it
 
03:10:13.110 --> 03:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
went through the audit and now all the
 
03:10:15.980 --> 03:10:15.990 align:start position:0%
eyes are crossed
 
03:10:18.660 --> 03:10:18.670 align:start position:0%
but you wouldn't wouldn't be reflected
 
03:10:21.980 --> 03:10:21.990 align:start position:0%
in your other revenue focus the
 
03:10:24.930 --> 03:10:24.940 align:start position:0%
preliminary cash base for the
 
03:10:27.990 --> 03:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
preliminary unaudited wouldn't
 
03:10:31.171 --> 03:10:31.181 align:start position:0%
necessarily reflect that and it won't
 
03:10:36.180 --> 03:10:36.190 align:start position:0%
show up in August either in the month
 
03:10:39.751 --> 03:10:39.761 align:start position:0%
would be they would make an adjustment
 
03:10:44.610 --> 03:10:44.620 align:start position:0%
for it once they believe it's recognized
 
03:10:46.410 --> 03:10:46.420 align:start position:0%
for the prior year so you shouldn't see
 
03:10:51.270 --> 03:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
it in here Frank so maybe we ought to
 
03:10:53.490 --> 03:10:53.500 align:start position:0%
handle that with some kind of footnote
 
03:10:56.100 --> 03:10:56.110 align:start position:0%
in our estimate that we believe that
 
03:10:58.530 --> 03:10:58.540 align:start position:0%
there's another 18 million million call
 
03:11:03.091 --> 03:11:03.101 align:start position:0%
it coming in July or August which
 
03:11:07.261 --> 03:11:07.271 align:start position:0%
belongs to June and which will not be
 
03:11:12.060 --> 03:11:12.070 align:start position:0%
seen again except in the cavern what I
 
03:11:14.490 --> 03:11:14.500 align:start position:0%
mean I think what I took from today's
 
03:11:17.160 --> 03:11:17.170 align:start position:0%
conversation from dra is that they
 
03:11:18.900 --> 03:11:18.910 align:start position:0%
really need to see June come to an end
 
03:11:21.480 --> 03:11:21.490 align:start position:0%
to see how the behavior of the the
 
03:11:25.261 --> 03:11:25.271 align:start position:0%
companies and taxpayer kind of seeing
 
03:11:28.011 --> 03:11:28.021 align:start position:0%
for the month you think if there's 18 of
 
03:11:31.620 --> 03:11:31.630 align:start position:0%
money that people pushed out to June
 
03:11:33.300 --> 03:11:33.310 align:start position:0%
when they probably shouldn't have
 
03:11:34.829 --> 03:11:34.839 align:start position:0%
are they going to pay that was one of
 
03:11:36.689 --> 03:11:36.699 align:start position:0%
the questions and if they pay there's
 
03:11:37.739 --> 03:11:37.749 align:start position:0%
gonna be some penalty and interest
 
03:11:40.079 --> 03:11:40.089 align:start position:0%
associated with that when the auditors
 
03:11:42.809 --> 03:11:42.819 align:start position:0%
get done with them
 
03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:45.010 align:start position:0%
other factors related to federal return
 
03:11:49.260 --> 03:11:49.270 align:start position:0%
and and the big companies deciding is it
 
03:11:52.409 --> 03:11:52.419 align:start position:0%
better to you know New Hampshire as a
 
03:11:55.469 --> 03:11:55.479 align:start position:0%
smaller state and say okay I'm willing
 
03:11:57.210 --> 03:11:57.220 align:start position:0%
to pay penalties and interest on what I
 
03:11:58.920 --> 03:11:58.930 align:start position:0%
might not paid in order to pay for a
 
03:12:01.469 --> 03:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
larger company I see a larger state and
 
03:12:04.439 --> 03:12:04.449 align:start position:0%
a way bigger penalty and interest and
 
03:12:06.179 --> 03:12:06.189 align:start position:0%
those are all behavior nobody can really
 
03:12:08.699 --> 03:12:08.709 align:start position:0%
predict it this time I don't know if you
 
03:12:11.399 --> 03:12:11.409 align:start position:0%
need a nobody to miss because you it's
 
03:12:12.809 --> 03:12:12.819 align:start position:0%
done the conversations I've had with you
 
03:12:15.659 --> 03:12:15.669 align:start position:0%
is that you and your committee looking
 
03:12:19.019 --> 03:12:19.029 align:start position:0%
at fiscal 21 pretty regularly throughout
 
03:12:21.059 --> 03:12:21.069 align:start position:0%
the upcoming year
 
03:12:23.130 --> 03:12:23.140 align:start position:0%
so you would get a sense in the next
 
03:12:25.769 --> 03:12:25.779 align:start position:0%
time you get some information from DRA
 
03:12:29.219 --> 03:12:29.229 align:start position:0%
what actually occurred and if you then
 
03:12:30.659 --> 03:12:30.669 align:start position:0%
need to make a note that might be that's
 
03:12:34.619 --> 03:12:34.629 align:start position:0%
time to do it I don't remember that
 
03:12:36.979 --> 03:12:36.989 align:start position:0%
we've ever even gotten that information
 
03:12:41.159 --> 03:12:41.169 align:start position:0%
except maybe two years later when we
 
03:12:43.309 --> 03:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
were talking about previous pay
 
03:12:49.500 --> 03:12:49.510 align:start position:0%
performance but they did say that these
 
03:12:51.779 --> 03:12:51.789 align:start position:0%
larger companies seem to be waiting
 
03:12:54.210 --> 03:12:54.220 align:start position:0%
until they had finished their federal
 
03:12:55.649 --> 03:12:55.659 align:start position:0%
returns and they're gonna finish their
 
03:13:03.260 --> 03:13:03.270 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:06.210 --> 03:13:06.220 align:start position:0%
so anyway the best guess I think it's
 
03:13:07.439 --> 03:13:07.449 align:start position:0%
best guess I don't know if you need to
 
03:13:10.679 --> 03:13:10.689 align:start position:0%
put a note like three numbers that have
 
03:13:13.769 --> 03:13:13.779 align:start position:0%
questions though yeah yes we've got
 
03:13:16.170 --> 03:13:16.180 align:start position:0%
three members of questions or comments
 
03:13:19.019 --> 03:13:19.029 align:start position:0%
representing but Brahmi okay I have a
 
03:13:21.359 --> 03:13:21.369 align:start position:0%
larger question I mean what's the
 
03:13:26.460 --> 03:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
pressure on us to do 21 estimates now
 
03:13:33.599 --> 03:13:33.609 align:start position:0%
and not wait until after June for a
 
03:13:37.939 --> 03:13:37.949 align:start position:0%
number and there's also the question of
 
03:13:45.321 --> 03:13:45.331 align:start position:0%
whether now that's that's for 2020
 
03:13:48.621 --> 03:13:48.631 align:start position:0%
looking for a number at some point I
 
03:13:53.940 --> 03:13:53.950 align:start position:0%
would say by August we're going to have
 
03:13:56.730 --> 03:13:56.740 align:start position:0%
to try to do something serious about 20
 
03:14:02.161 --> 03:14:02.171 align:start position:0%
20 21 because there are many I mean
 
03:14:04.801 --> 03:14:04.811 align:start position:0%
depending on on what happens if the
 
03:14:06.930 --> 03:14:06.940 align:start position:0%
governor maintains control of everything
 
03:14:10.071 --> 03:14:10.081 align:start position:0%
until I've until the election and after
 
03:14:13.741 --> 03:14:13.751 align:start position:0%
then on we can't do a supplemental
 
03:14:15.810 --> 03:14:15.820 align:start position:0%
budget but we did two supplemental
 
03:14:18.980 --> 03:14:18.990 align:start position:0%
budgets in the Great Recession
 
03:14:22.171 --> 03:14:22.181 align:start position:0%
readjusting things and programming out
 
03:14:26.881 --> 03:14:26.891 align:start position:0%
where the spending had to be cut and how
 
03:14:34.701 --> 03:14:34.711 align:start position:0%
much spending had to be cut for that was
 
03:15:03.900 --> 03:15:03.910 align:start position:0%
September we get upset if it's going to
 
03:15:05.940 --> 03:15:05.950 align:start position:0%
be a question of going going worse
 
03:15:08.970 --> 03:15:08.980 align:start position:0%
rather than going better the more cuts
 
03:15:14.100 --> 03:15:14.110 align:start position:0%
have to be made so we have no choice but
 
03:15:17.011 --> 03:15:17.021 align:start position:0%
to arrange them because as many there's
 
03:15:19.501 --> 03:15:19.511 align:start position:0%
20 of us in this committee and there's
 
03:15:21.211 --> 03:15:21.221 align:start position:0%
probably 20 opinions as to how quickly
 
03:15:27.241 --> 03:15:27.251 align:start position:0%
things are going to open up new strains
 
03:15:31.591 --> 03:15:31.601 align:start position:0%
are not really affected at all if you
 
03:15:33.631 --> 03:15:33.641 align:start position:0%
look at the main ones they're influenced
 
03:15:36.031 --> 03:15:36.041 align:start position:0%
by different things I could see on
 
03:15:41.520 --> 03:15:41.530 align:start position:0%
Monday or even so caucuses the battle
 
03:15:44.281 --> 03:15:44.291 align:start position:0%
being a man this discussion is it a V is
 
03:15:46.970 --> 03:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
it a V and not a V what's going to be
 
03:15:51.360 --> 03:15:51.370 align:start position:0%
that will really dictate the revenue so
 
03:15:55.081 --> 03:15:55.091 align:start position:0%
I could see in my mind the high estimate
 
03:15:57.490 --> 03:15:57.500 align:start position:0%
is is based on
 
03:16:00.760 --> 03:16:00.770 align:start position:0%
quick opening and hello estimates based
 
03:16:04.210 --> 03:16:04.220 align:start position:0%
on a on a slow opening so I guess that's
 
03:16:15.190 --> 03:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
what I think it is on this and others
 
03:16:16.780 --> 03:16:16.790 align:start position:0%
might be affected but in a very
 
03:16:17.760 --> 03:16:17.770 align:start position:0%
different way
 
03:16:24.130 --> 03:16:24.140 align:start position:0%
absolutely so it's discussions if we all
 
03:16:39.070 --> 03:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
know there was a vaccine Southworth had
 
03:16:43.360 --> 03:16:43.370 align:start position:0%
his hand up thank you and I suggest I
 
03:16:46.389 --> 03:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
think it would save a lot of I think it
 
03:16:48.610 --> 03:16:48.620 align:start position:0%
would save a lot of time on Monday if
 
03:16:51.190 --> 03:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
you already come in with a range that we
 
03:16:52.809 --> 03:16:52.819 align:start position:0%
could play with rather than starting at
 
03:16:56.229 --> 03:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
zero because we're it's not gonna be way
 
03:16:59.740 --> 03:16:59.750 align:start position:0%
off from the agency s cool just to have
 
03:17:01.660 --> 03:17:01.670 align:start position:0%
a starting range I think would save a
 
03:17:04.750 --> 03:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
lot of time maybe after to caucus a
 
03:17:07.540 --> 03:17:07.550 align:start position:0%
couple of you could talk but just that
 
03:17:09.849 --> 03:17:09.859 align:start position:0%
be a big time-saver and maybe even the
 
03:17:13.150 --> 03:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
range could be on our sheet or we can
 
03:17:16.179 --> 03:17:16.189 align:start position:0%
put on our sheet because if we start at
 
03:17:18.280 --> 03:17:18.290 align:start position:0%
zero it's gonna go around and around
 
03:17:24.729 --> 03:17:24.739 align:start position:0%
yeah I think could could do that that
 
03:17:31.179 --> 03:17:31.189 align:start position:0%
would help everyone I think it's okay
 
03:17:36.389 --> 03:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
and Jenny you had your hand up um
 
03:17:40.420 --> 03:17:40.430 align:start position:0%
Patrick asked my question like oh yeah
 
03:17:45.150 --> 03:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
okay on us to get it done for 2021 I
 
03:17:47.380 --> 03:17:47.390 align:start position:0%
knew I should have started with the
 
03:17:48.639 --> 03:17:48.649 align:start position:0%
person who hadn't asked many questions
 
03:18:00.969 --> 03:18:00.979 align:start position:0%
yet okay so we're all set into our
 
03:18:04.030 --> 03:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
caucuses and then Monday right and the
 
03:18:06.820 --> 03:18:06.830 align:start position:0%
Democratic one it's gonna start at one I
 
03:18:10.210 --> 03:18:10.220 align:start position:0%
don't have the confirmation yet cuz
 
03:18:13.110 --> 03:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
I haven't looked at my email all day
 
03:18:17.979 --> 03:18:17.989 align:start position:0%
from Dan if it's going to come from him
 
03:18:20.290 --> 03:18:20.300 align:start position:0%
or not if not I think Jerry had
 
03:18:25.479 --> 03:18:25.489 align:start position:0%
suggested that he could fill in so so
 
03:18:28.599 --> 03:18:28.609 align:start position:0%
that's know so you'll get something from
 
03:18:29.769 --> 03:18:29.779 align:start position:0%
one or the other
 
03:18:32.769 --> 03:18:32.779 align:start position:0%
you need only co-host help because I got
 
03:18:38.979 --> 03:18:38.989 align:start position:0%
to step out well I'm sort of getting I
 
03:18:46.260 --> 03:18:46.270 align:start position:0%
got something else from Dan you don't
 
03:18:49.630 --> 03:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
know how many you're the credit details
 
03:18:51.370 --> 03:18:51.380 align:start position:0%
they're even born doesn't know how the
 
03:18:53.410 --> 03:18:53.420 align:start position:0%
very your kind of details there are
 
03:18:56.530 --> 03:18:56.540 align:start position:0%
mixed into trying to do this stuff
 
03:19:03.160 --> 03:19:03.170 align:start position:0%
virtually where you go bucs that's why
 
03:19:13.059 --> 03:19:13.069 align:start position:0%
you get the big bucks 25 bucks make sure
 
03:19:14.260 --> 03:19:14.270 align:start position:0%
you push your button see you get your
 
03:19:28.929 --> 03:19:28.939 align:start position:0%
mileage to give a smiling we haven't
 
03:19:30.820 --> 03:19:30.830 align:start position:0%
heard about that yeah okay so we're all
