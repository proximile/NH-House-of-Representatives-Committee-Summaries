uh casualty of the uh shutdown because
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
of covid so here it is again so for the
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
benefit of those who didn't hear it last
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
year uh I had provided my testimony I
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
don't know whether you have it or not
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
but anyway um I I'll walk you through
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
the bill if you have it in front of you
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
um sections one and two are truly
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
housekeeping uh Provisions uh because
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
we're repealing
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
um RSA 651a which has to do with uh
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
hearings at nine
 
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
months we need
 
00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
to uh repeal it in the in the C in the
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
as a cross reference in the involuntary
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
commitment so that's just a housekeeping
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
thing sections one and two of the bill
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
second degree assault Reckless conduct
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
stalking tampering with W fonus use of
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
firearm eight separate
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
crimes so since the there is no
 
00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:16.519 align:start position:0%
reference to nonviolent crimes in the
 
00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:19.959 align:start position:0%
chapter anymore that's a a remnant of uh
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
house bill um excuse me Senate Bill 500
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
from uh 2010 that has been modified so
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
many times so rather than Define
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
nonviolent crimes which is a phrase not
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
used in the chapter we're going to
 
00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
define the violent crimes the eight that
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
are listed in
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
651 A5 and also the eight that are
 
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:47.959 align:start position:0%
currently listed uh in the chapter
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
and the reference to violent crimes is
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
is important because it's used in
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
determining the length of any uh parole
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
revocation okay uh section four
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh of the bill uh which is on page two
 
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
on the top um is a recommendation from
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
the uh LBA audit they the current law
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
requires a 15 to 30-day notice
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
requirement to the county attorney to
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
the police chief and to the victim and
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
hearing the audit observed that the
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
statute didn't distinguish between
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
release hearings revocation hearings
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
reconsideration hearings and review
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
hearings those are the four kinds of
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
hearings we
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
have the other than the release hearings
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
revocations reconsideration and
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
reviews can only result in either
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
extending the period of incarceration
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
for somebody who's already been approved
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
at a duly noticed hearing we don't think
 
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
there's any need to notify the uh police
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
chief the County Attorney every time we
 
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
see this person who's been approved for
 
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:00.519 align:start position:0%
parole again uh the right to no law
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
still applies uh so we do Post notice of
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
all kinds of hearings on our website
 
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
this just clarifies that the 15 to
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
30-day notice to the police the County
 
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
Attorney the public and the victim
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
applies only to release
 
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
hearings uh section five uh make several
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
changes in the uh that affect the length
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
of committ for parole violation so
 
00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
somebody's on parole they commit a
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
parole violation they come back back to
 
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
us for a revocation hearing at that
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
hearing uh if they are found true to
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
have violated
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
board is Guided by this section of of
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
the law with regard to what kind of a
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
sanction we can impose the general
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
sanction for any violation of parole is
 
00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:53.790 align:start position:0%
sanction for any violation of parole is
90

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
90
 
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.430 align:start position:0%
90
days

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
however that we can give more or less if
 
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
it meets certain other criteria but in
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
setback the statute would require that
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
we release them after 90 days even if
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
they hadn't completed their programs
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
even if they didn't have a place to go
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
even if they didn't have treatment set
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
up in the community we would like to
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%
change the law to specify that violators
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
who get the 90-day sanction meet the
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
criteria for parole before they're being
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
released just like everybody else who is
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
released people who have a 90day setback
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
should meet the criteria for parole and
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
I've listed the criteria parole on the
 
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
on the back of the handout that I
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
provided uh we have had inmates I mean
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
they all know they call it a 90-day
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
Mando I'm out of here I don't have to
 
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
tell you where I'm
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
going how it's hard to supervise
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
somebody if you don't know where they're
 
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
going so we we need this we need them to
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria for
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
parole uh this the second change uh is
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
to modify the reference to uh the
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
dynamic risk factors for sex offenders
 
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
who violate their parole it's a
 
00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839 align:start position:0%
practical matter if you're a sex
 
00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:16.519 align:start position:0%
offender we don't care whether you
 
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
violated your Dynamic risk factors we
 
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959 align:start position:0%
care that you're a sex offender and you
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
violated parole so you should be
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
eligible for an more than 90 days in in
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
certain cases so um
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're eliminating the reference to the
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
dynamic risk
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
factors uh the uh next section uh also
 
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's on uh page two line 26 and
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
also on page three line 14 this corrects
 
00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:45.189 align:start position:0%
also on page three line 14 this corrects
a

00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
mistake in the list of violent crimes
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
you saw in the the current list of
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
non-violent crimes it says all crimes
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
except for these two categories eight
 
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
that are listed in one section and eight
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
that are listed in the statute well they
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
on the the length of time we're allowed
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
to uh recommit somebody the length of
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
the setback this is when the definition
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
of violent crime comes comes into play
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
so we want to be make clear that if you
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
violate any of the 16 crimes that we've
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
listed you are eligible for either an
 
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.670 align:start position:0%
listed you are eligible for either an
enhanced

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
enhanced
 
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.350 align:start position:0%
enhanced
sentence

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
sorry you're eligible for an enhanced
 
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
eligible to have a reduced
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
sentence uh so that this corrects a
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
mistake uh also uh on page two line 34
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're eliminating references to
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
the focused evidence-based programming
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
aimed at re-engaging parole Le in their
 
00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
parole plan
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
as envisioned in Senate Bill 500 there
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
would be uh
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
a 90 days set back for everybody
 
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it was your first
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
or second or what your crime was there
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
was supposed to have a special program
 
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
in a separate place to engage paroles in
 
00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:22.759 align:start position:0%
in their re-engage them in their parole
 
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
plan this never happened both for
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
budgetary reasons and also because
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
everybody doesn't need the same program
 
00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
uh right now they they design programs
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
about the the needs of uh each of the
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
inmates so this bill repeals the
 
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
reference to that specific program which
 
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.590 align:start position:0%
reference to that specific program which
never

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
never
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
existed uh section section six removes
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
the requirement that the Parole Board
 
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
review every Parolees file every three
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
years uh that's never been done uh by
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
the parole board in its 30s something
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
years of existence uh because it's
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
already being done by the chief of the
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
each of the district offices so it's a a
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
burden for the parole board if we were
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
to do it and it's already being done so
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
nobody gets lost in the
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
system uh section seven uh of the bill
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
contains two
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
repeals right now we
 
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
have a provision on the law that says
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
applications for parole can be heard in
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
in non-public session but our rules have
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
long allowed anyone to get an audio
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
recording of parole hearings so when I
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
came on as chairman I said this is crazy
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
if you can get an audio hearing why
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
can't you be there so I opened up the
 
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
parole hearings uh to the public um so
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
we have been conducting them in public
 
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
the LBA pointed out this discrepancy so
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
this bill cures that by doing away with
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
the section of the right to know law
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
that says that parole hearings will be
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
heard in non-public session uh parole
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
records however will continue to be
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.309 align:start position:0%
records however will continue to be
non-public

00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
non-public
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
and the last provision of the bill on
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
page three line 29 eliminates the
 
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
requirement to hold a parole hearing for
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
an inmate nine months before as Max
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
under Senate Bill 500 as originally
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
envisioned everybody would be
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
automatically released if they were
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
still there nine months before their
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
maximum sentence regardless of their
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
behavior they would just be
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
released um that law was changed so that
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
they are entitled to a hearing nine
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
months before their Max okay so they
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
come into us they uh have a hearing but
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
they don't have a plan they don't have
 
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
they've have terrible disciplinary rate
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
there's no way they're going to be
 
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
released so this bill does away with the
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
requirement that we have the hearing you
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
should know that this doesn't take away
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
any rights from any prisoner anybody who
 
00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:52.430 align:start position:0%
any rights from any prisoner anybody who
is

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
here uh as long
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
as nine months before the maximum at any
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
time time when they've got their um
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
housing plan when they've completed
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
their program when they've meet the
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
criteria for parole they can ask for a
 
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
hearing so this doesn't take away any of
 
00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:12.039 align:start position:0%
their rights it just takes away uh the
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
requirement that we have a hearing for
 
00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:18.039 align:start position:0%
somebody we know isn't isn't ready to be
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
released so the uh passage of this bill
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
will uh enhance our efficiency and
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness and I hope you will
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
support it as aop pass just as you did
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%

my question can you tell me what uh a

dynamic risk factor

is uh the dynamic risk factors are those
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
that that uh can be changed um
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
homelessness loss of support substance

representative Newman you recognize
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my my only concern
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
that was an excellent summary of The Bu
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
of the bill I mean of yeah the bill and
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
um my only concern is there are a lot of
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
laws that we're going to be considering
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
that have to do with parole and some of
 
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
the uh wording has been changing in
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
there that that relates to parole so we
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
probably have to refer back to that and
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
see how the two things might conflict
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
when we consider those other bills thank
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%

we should retain
that

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
discussion you
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
chairman um it was clear on Monday that
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
I had no idea what this bill did are the
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
laws that really were effective um since
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
that time I've uh taken the time to
 
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.110 align:start position:0%
that time I've uh taken the time to
educate

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
educate
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
myself uh by talking to
 
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.950 align:start position:0%
myself uh by talking to
attorneys

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
and I see no reason to retain this bill
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
I think that we should uh rule it in
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate this bill uh
 
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
would uh add an exception to the uh uh
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
provocations section of uh well it's not
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
a law but the Publications and I see no
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
reason to do that those those probations
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
are a high enough bar to uh clear
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
without making exceptions so if you want
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
to retain it I'll vote for it but I
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
really think that the motion should be
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
you representative BR
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
right thank you chairman um I think this
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
bill should be ought to pass I feel
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
especially I mean what we saw on Monday
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
it definitely shows that this bill is
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
needed um it was
 
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.789 align:start position:0%
needed um it was
unexcusable

00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:09.799 align:start position:0%
unexcusable
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how we could retain
 
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:14.900 align:start position:0%
this bill so I'll be
 
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.830 align:start position:0%
this bill so I'll be
[Music]

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
opposing representative Newman you
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chairman
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
um my feeling about this bill is I think
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
it's an important bill that it ought to
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
pass but I um don't see a great
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
likelihood of that so therefore I will
 
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
reluctantly vote to retain it so that we
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
can have the opportunity to work on this
 
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
bill sometime between in the remainder
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you I I also believe uh
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
that this should that we should be
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
voting uh ought to pass on this bill
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
um I think the folks who testified made
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
a an extremely compelling case uh on
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
Friday as to why this bill should pass
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
um I I also think that some of the the
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
issues um that people in the lgbtq
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
community face uh when it comes to
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
getting a fair Shake in the courts and
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
getting a fair Shake in the legislature
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh were Exposed on
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
Friday and uh I believe that this
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
legislation uh is necessary and I will
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
it you Mr chair I too propose the retain
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
I think that it should go for as AR to
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
pass um there were compelling
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
testimonies on our last visit group
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
session and um and just in new of what
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
what transpired that day it definitely
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
pass representative Conley thank you Mr
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I agree this bill should be off
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
passed the bills that this committee has
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
retained have been complicated there
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
have been easily
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
identifiable issues that need to be
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
resolved through a subcommittee or or an
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
intense work session I don't see any of
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
those issues with this bill it seems
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
like we understand uh what this bill
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
intends to do I think we can recognize
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
the problem it intends to
 
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.110 align:start position:0%
the problem it intends to
address

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
and uh seeing no real um things that
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
needed to be fixed I would suggest off
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
retaining representative

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
mistake here I think this needs to be
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
octop passed we have some of the highest
 
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
um lgbtq communities population in this
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
state and we couldn't even respect them
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
enough to give them their own hearing we
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
lumped it in with another bill and on
 
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:21.210 align:start position:0%

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
um in the 1980s we saw a wave of
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
so-called yet tough on crime policies
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
these included mandatory minimums three
 
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
strikes laws and a policy known as truth
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
and sentencing which required that
 
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
people serve a certain percentage of
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
their minimum sentence before being
 
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
parole these 1980 policies were stream
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
and we spent the past few decades
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
walking them back this committee passed
 
00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.670 align:start position:0%
walking them back this committee passed
legis

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
legis
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
legistation already this session to
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
remove some of the remaining mandatory
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
minimums that we still have on the books
 
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this requirement has prevented
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from being able to Grant
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
time off for good behavior meaning for
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
decades we have lacked the ability to
 
00:44:26.079 --> 00:44:27.549 align:start position:0%
decades we have lacked the ability to
incentivize

00:44:27.549 --> 00:44:27.559 align:start position:0%
incentivize
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
incarceration moreover truth and
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
sentencing has resulted in people
 
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
spending more time in prison meaning a
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
higher price tag for taxpayers who have
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
to pay for every day someone spends in
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
prison with one year in prison costing
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
$40,000 truth and sentencing is
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
expensive extreme and outdated
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
many other the states have repealed or
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
amended their truth in sentencing laws
 
00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:04.839 align:start position:0%
including those States that had less
 
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
extreme versions to begin
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
with and I say that because New
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was the only state during that
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
100%

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
the 1980 notion that if we just extr we
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
just extreme enough in our punishments
 
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
we could deter or even End crime has
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
been consistently
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
disproven extreme sentencing causes far
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
more harm than good the goal of
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
incarceration should be
 
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and we need to amend our
 
00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.790 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and we need to amend our
policies

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
accordingly HB 598 would amend our truth
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
in sentencing law to require that people
 
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
serve 50% of their minimum before being
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
El eligible to apply for a parole being
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for parole does not mean that a
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
person will automatically be parole it
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
means they can apply and the parole
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
board will make a determination on a
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
Case by casee
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
basis Let Me Clear be clear this
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
legislation will not automatically
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
result in people let out of prison soon
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
it simply swaps a one-size fitall policy
 
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
for one that allows the parole board to
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
consider the unique circumstance of an
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
individual's case their rehabilitative
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
Journey during incarceration and whether
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
Parole in
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
2015 approximately 30 States had this
 
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.069 align:start position:0%
2015 approximately 30 States had this
law

00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
and we call it
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
TI the District of
 
00:47:04.829 --> 00:47:04.839 align:start position:0%
Columbia have them in place in contrast
 
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
States like Indiana Texas Maryland and
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
Nebraska say inmates must serve at least
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
50% of their
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
time I allow my time to others that have
 
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
done more research and can speak more to
 
00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:24.710 align:start position:0%
done more research and can speak more to
the

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:34.670 align:start position:0%
 
issue

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
see seeing No Hands raised want to thank

00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
testimony and I would just
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
clarify this rule right now generally
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
speaking when a representative who a
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
member of committee produces a bill
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
they're not permitted to ask any
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
questions however we're hearing two
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
bills at the same time so representative
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
gab you will be permitted to ask
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
Mr we're gonna keep we're going to keep

right thank you I'm sorry about the the
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
audio situation there uh my name is
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
representative Max Abramson representing
 
00:48:55.549 --> 00:48:55.559 align:start position:0%
C Brook Hampton and Hampton Falls I'm
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
I'm introducing House Bill 138 this is
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
this the same bill that I introduced
 
00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:05.079 align:start position:0%
last session um guaranteeing a a uh 25y
 
00:49:09.069 --> 00:49:09.079 align:start position:0%
year a Pearle hearing at the 25 year
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
mark um and I want to start by answering
 
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that I got last
 
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
year that I had to do some research on
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
um the first question that members of
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
the committee asked was you know how
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
many what percentage of people um who go
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
to a hearing actually get paroled and I
 
00:49:24.789 --> 00:49:24.799 align:start position:0%
decided to go go ahead and pull up the
 
00:49:27.309 --> 00:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
numbers from other States um and it's
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's all over the map uh Most states are
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
in the 20 some per to 30 some perc range
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
um so most people get a parole hearing
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
are denied and go back into the system
 
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
but they get another shot uh in the
 
00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:41.559 align:start position:0%
future there were two outliers I believe
 
00:49:41.559 --> 00:49:43.670 align:start position:0%
future there were two outliers I believe
Michigan

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
Michigan
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
and um Nevada that had I believe a 69 or
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
70% um uh parole rate where or release
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
rate um there are three basic reasons
 
00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:57.079 align:start position:0%
for putting this in the first reason is
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
for correctional officer safety and
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
stress uh as far as why I put it in
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
after I spoke last session on repeal of
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
the death penalty literally as I sat
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
down another member said to me okay well
 
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
what about uh safety of correctional
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
officers and he brought up an
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
exceptional case what if you have
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
someone serving life in prison you take
 
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
away the death penalty um and now
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's no incentive for an inmate who
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
might be violent some of the 4,000
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
inmates there's a small percentage who
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
are extremely still extremely violent
 
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
and should never be released um and what
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
prevents them from killing a
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
correctional officer and I thought about
 
00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
the correctional officer safety first
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
and then thought about the stress levels
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh I noticed um some years ago that we
 
00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
were discussing the high stress levels
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
of Corrections Officers and it's
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
contributing to a lot of turnout but
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
it's also causing contributing to a lot
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
of stress and health problems for those
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
who are serving in our our prison system
 
00:50:56.589 --> 00:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
um so I thought well if there's just
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
even a possibility of a a a parole
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
hearing somewhere in their future
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
they're a lot less likely to take the
 
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
life of another person another inmate a
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
visitor or um a correctional uh security
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
Personnel the second reason that was
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
brought up brought to my attention I
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
think after I put the bill in was that
 
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
when inmates are very old when they get
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
into their 60s and
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
70s uh they develop more and more severe
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh chronic medical conditions um and uh
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
I'm looking forward into the future not
 
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
just under the current uh
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic that
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
um uh they have to have Specialists
 
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
coming into the prison well specialist
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
coming into the prison uh has to take an
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
entire day off from work in order to to
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
drive out to the prison and see an
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
inmate and uh the the costs of those
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
um those types of visits are extremely
 
00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.030 align:start position:0%
um those types of visits are extremely
expensive

00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
00:51:57.549 --> 00:51:57.559 align:start position:0%
and they become more and more common as
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
the as the inmate gets older um more
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
feeble and as their chronic conditions
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
get worse um and that's exactly at the
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
age uh 70-year-old inmates are generally
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
not statistically a danger to society
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
even if they may have been a danger when
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
they were 18 or 20 or 25 certainly when
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
they're in their 70s uh the chances of
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
them going out and committing another
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
violent crime are very very uh slim and
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason why parole
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
boards are much more likely to parole an
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
inmate who who is much older um and they
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
do so on second deegree homicide cases
 
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
second deegree homicide where it's a
 
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
unplanned um either Crime of Passion
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
spur of the moment or under duress um
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
manslaughter or second degree they are
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
getting uh paroled especially if they
 
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
are older inmates they have a their a
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
right to a parole hearing at 18 years
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
this would just simply guarantee it at
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
at 25 years and the third reason and I
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
think the most important reason for me
 
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
is the number of wrongful conviction
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
cases where uh there were some clear-cut
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
cases when I started investigating New
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's wrongful conviction cases
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
but there were some great areas where
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
even I wasn't certain someone is
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
maintaining their innocence but uh I'm
 
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
only about half certain that they really
 
00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.430 align:start position:0%
only about half certain that they really
were

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
innocent um I'm not going to name names
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
but um were there was some evidence of
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing but maybe not enough to
 
00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
secure a criminal conviction uh in my
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
own self-defense case I did a lot of
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
research on Forensic methods and most if
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
not all of the forensic methods that
 
00:53:34.109 --> 00:53:34.119 align:start position:0%
were being used to convict people 25
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
years ago have been proven to be
 
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
completely invalid um Congress
 
00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:41.799 align:start position:0%
commissioned a study I believe in 2001
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
that produced a book called
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
strengthening forensics a path forward
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
that book didn't come out until
 
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
2010 um it's a very worthwhile book I
 
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
think it's about
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
$55 um I think that every member of the
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
committee should should maybe even every
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
member of the House should get a copy of
 
00:53:58.030 --> 00:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
that and see some of the problems that
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
have existed in in forensics every
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
single method that they examine from
 
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
blood samples hair samples
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
fingerprints um everything except for
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear DNA testing it proven to be um
 
00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:16.839 align:start position:0%
either invalid uh junk science or needed
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
to go through additional scrutiny that
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
you needed to have uh corroboration by
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
another forensic expert um and one of
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
the criticisms of Innocence project as
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
they went through these cases is that
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
they found that defense
 
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
attorneys um often weren't even
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
cross-examining forensic experts that
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
forensics methods were once thought to
 
00:54:38.109 --> 00:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
be irrefutable and unquestionable and
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
now we know that the the error rates can
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
be as high as 50 or
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
60% um for some of them so a a parole
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
hearing would just kind of be one last
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
line of defense um it allows human
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
beings to reopen the case take a look at
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
evidence that was not heard by the jury
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh in particular evidence that that has
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
only recently come up become available
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
um or cases where um
 
00:55:10.109 --> 00:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
uh where the forensic methods used to
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
convict people the transcripts were
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
brought under scr scrutiny after the
 
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
trial and found to not be consistent
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
enough or may not even be admissible in
 
00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:22.109 align:start position:0%
enough or may not even be admissible in
court

00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
anymore and of course I'll take
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.870 align:start position:0%
anymore and of course I'll take
questions

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Hopper uh thank
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
for uh taking my question I have uh
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
personally witnessed I think only one
 
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
parole hearing and I thought parole
 
00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.750 align:start position:0%
parole hearing and I thought parole
hearings

00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
were um try to determine whether the
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
parole Le or the uh the
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
inmate was safe to release into the
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
public whether they're
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
Behavior Uh in in prison and things that
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
they've done in prison justify releasing
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
those people into the public I is is it
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
the case that TR hearings are also used
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
to retry a
 
00:56:13.789 --> 00:56:13.799 align:start position:0%
case not usually you're you're right
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
that that is the number one reason that
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
that they they do psychological
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
evaluations and they'll even talk to um
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
people who work in that particular
 
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
facility the number one issue that
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about is is that
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
have they gone through the reforms that
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
they need to go through have they done
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
the work um have they admitted
 
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility for what they've done um
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
the number one question and I have a
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
friend in town who worked on the who was
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
on the parole board for a long time the
 
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
number one question on their mind is is
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
this person safe to go back out into the
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
community however Pearl boards um people
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
are allowed to bring in um evidence um
 
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
in in particular if you have something
 
00:56:59.950 --> 00:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
like a I don't know fingerprint or
 
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
testimony or some such thing they can
 
00:57:04.109 --> 00:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
draw attention to that issue and say
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
well there's there's there's Reasonable
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
Doubt and and usually it'll be um you
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
know somebody did actually kill the
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
person or was present but it wasn't um
 
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
it it wasn't at the level that they they
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
said when when you um negligent homicide
 
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
second deegree homicide manslaughter and
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
other charges if evidence is sometimes
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
kept out by the judge because the judge
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand at the time of trial
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
the the severity of the evidence or they
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
just sometimes exclude it um because the
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
defense attorney didn't I guess sell the
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
witness or explain what the witness was
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
going to say in enough detail um there
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
are all kinds of problems and and and
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
things that happen at trial and the
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
parole board um does sometimes look at
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
evidence to see if it's an over
 
00:57:54.029 --> 00:57:54.039 align:start position:0%
overcharging over sentencing or wrongful
 
00:57:54.039 --> 00:57:56.829 align:start position:0%
overcharging over sentencing or wrongful
conviction

00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.839 --> 00:57:57.789 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you representative
 
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
and representative the chair would uh
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
ask to inquire a
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
question and I want to thank you in
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
advance for taking my question in
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
respect to lines n and 10 po
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
138 it reads that b basically expressly
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
exclude any person that been sentenced
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
to uh death the death penalty before the
 
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
effective my question is if that
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
sentence were to be commuted would that
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
particular uh individual be eligible of
 
00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:34.309 align:start position:0%
particular uh individual be eligible of
25

00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:37.039 align:start position:0%
yearses no they wouldn't that's uh I
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
think we all know who we're talking
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
about um I I put that in as a
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
u um personal issue that the um I knew
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
Michael Briggs and he was a very
 
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.069 align:start position:0%
Michael Briggs and he was a very
professional

00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:58:53.069 --> 00:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
model um officer I didn't want this
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
being used in any particular way to help
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
his uh killer get out now the bill is in
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
front of the committee and if the
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
committee wants to delete that um you
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
know that's that's your decision but my
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
preference would be that that the the
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
killer in question um deserves the
 
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
worse thank you for taking my
 
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm curious just
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
what percentage or or how many people
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
are currently in the prison system uh
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
who might be eligible for something like
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
this um that's actually a good question
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
um the the methodology used in the bill
 
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections indicates
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
that there are 114 individuals that be
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for parole before the minimum
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
sentence and 75 individuals that would
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
later become eligible for parole review
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
that are are serving life sentences
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
without parole so it's a it's a grand
 
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
total of about 190
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
individuals um so it it it's less than
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
5% of the the prison population but this
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
is one of those bills that's more of a
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
matter of uh principle
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
and yes it's not a very large number but
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
it it's just the need to have kind of
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
one last line of defense to have human
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
beings who um have the the ability to go
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
ahead and release someone under uh
 
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.510 align:start position:0%
ahead and release someone under uh
extraordinary

01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances represent M you recognize
 
01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
for a followup question thank you Mr
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
chair um we heard in testimony on a on a
 
01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:45.319 align:start position:0%
previous bill which was actually uh in
 
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
some ways related uh to this bill um
 
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
that one of the reasons for for not
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
automatically granting a Parole Review
 
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
is is that sometimes a prisoner um
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
simply may not be ready for it um or may
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
have been violent in prison committed
 
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
other offenses um uh and that's one of
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
the criteria that the parole board uses
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh how does this bill address situations
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
where uh an inmate May reach this point
 
01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
but not be um someone that we would
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to parole back into
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
society well the parole hearing is only
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
is only the hearing itself um the the
 
01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:33.799 align:start position:0%
question of release it's only a minority
 
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
of cases Who U where the individual
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
actually gets released on a first uh
 
01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.870 align:start position:0%
actually gets released on a first uh
parole

01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
parole
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
hearing um so if someone who continues
 
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
to remain violent in prison or causes
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
problems or refuses to accept
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
responsibility or or literally a few of
 
01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
these people still have the same
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
attitude 25 years later and those people
 
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
are not released um I don't have a
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
problem with with going through the time
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
to have that person have a parole
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
hearing but in that particular case I
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
think that the benefit of the parole
 
01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:05.799 align:start position:0%
hearing is to have an an additional
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
group of people looking at that that
 
01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
person's case in their their history in
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
prison and say you know there are other
 
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
people who are worthy of release and if
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to continue to conduct
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
yourself this way we're not going to
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
release you um the the
 
01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
possibility um even though it's a long
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
shot the possibility of uh parole and
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
release um is kind of an incentive that
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh the correctional officers and the
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
ward um sometimes need um in order to
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
control the population keep the uh keep
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
the prison itself safe and take some of
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
those individuals who are serving life
 
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
in prison who now you know for a lot of
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
them they're thinking hey um there's no
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
reason not to hurt someone there's no
 
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
reason not to commit another crime or
 
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
even rape or or commit uh uh murder
 
01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
while they're there if they're facing
 
01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
life with no possibility of parole there
 
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
has to be a slight possibility of parole
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
there has to be a slight possibility of
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
release um in order to get them to uh
 
01:03:06.319 --> 01:03:08.029 align:start position:0%
release um in order to get them to uh
shape

01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
shape
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:14.589 --> 01:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
you true thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:16.039 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
question uh you gave a number of
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
190 uh people in prison who would
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
qualify or may eventually qualify
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
190 uh in prison
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
for life without
 
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
parole yes those are all uh what they
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
call lwop or life without parole cases
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
and I believe according to legislative
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
Services the only type of case uh right
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
now under state law is is uh capital
 
01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
murder or first-degree murder I should
 
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
say that uh only uh a premeditated
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
murder um so there would be I think
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's 100 89 cases we get a couple more
 
01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
every year but uh that's the
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
abson is your feeling that percentage
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
wise there are uh too many prisoners I
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
mean do we as a whole have too many
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
prisoners in our prisons uh compared to
 
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.349 align:start position:0%
prisoners in our prisons uh compared to
other

01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
states uh compared to other states I
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
think that we have a smaller percentage
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
but um back in the 1970s we had 200
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
roughly and now we have about
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
4,000 uh about a third are serving time
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
for victimless crimes a little more than
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
a third um and actually a large
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
percentage are just people awaiting
 
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
hearings or waiting trial um
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
one of the people working at the public
 
01:04:58.109 --> 01:04:58.119 align:start position:0%
defenders office said that they they had
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
a client who'd been in there for three
 
01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
and a half years um who had not even had
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
their trial and that the case just kept
 
01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
getting kicked down the road so a large
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of the people who were in
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh haven't even been found
 
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
guilty yet so but on on the bigger issue
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
on the bigger question are there too
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
many people in in prison yes um but for
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
degree um first degree homicide
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
population I would I would view them as
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
separate and um I think that frankly
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
most of them deserve to be in prison um
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
and the parole hearing that I'm
 
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
proposing is just uh an incentive to try
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
to keep the U uh keep the Corrections
 
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
Officers safer and and get uh get
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
inmates to reform themselves turn
 
01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.069 align:start position:0%
inmates to reform themselves turn
themselves

01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%

I yeah uh good morning again Mr chairman
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I'm Donna
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
scitec uh I'm appearing on my own
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
behalf uh for part of one of these bills
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
and on behalf of the parole board uh in
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to both of these
 
01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.710 align:start position:0%
opposition to both of these
bills

01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh while it's fresh in your mind I want
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
to clarify some things uh the parole
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
board does not retry a case we don't
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
look at new evidence we look merely at
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
the criteria for parole uh as I have to
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
tell victims uh many times who come to
 
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
parole hearings that we are not a
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
resentencing body the judge who's heard
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
all the information and has heard from
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
the victims imposed a sentence that he
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
thought was just so
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh don't use this as a way as an
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
alternate way of appealing your case as
 
01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
far as our parole rate uh New Hampshire
 
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
has one of the highest parole rates in
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
the country we parole about 85% of the
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
people that we
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
hear uh and the other thing is the
 
01:07:52.029 --> 01:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
prison population is about 2,000 it has
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
been declining we have 500 fewer than we
 
01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
had a year
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
ago uh and the reference to people
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
languishing in jail the preach there are
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
no pre-trial detainees at the state
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
prison those are Folks at the
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
county so to just to clarify that so
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
back to my personal reason for opposing
 
01:08:13.319 --> 01:08:14.109 align:start position:0%
back to my personal reason for opposing
uh

01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
138 is that it violates truth and
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
sentencing uh anybody who knows me who's
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
been around the legislature for a long
 
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
time as I have and perhaps
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
representative Welch knows that I am the
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
mother of Truth and
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
sentencing there was a case of a
 
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
murderer in
 
01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
1983 who was given a life sentence and
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
he ended up being eligible for parole
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
after 10 years and there was a hue and
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
cry petitions we had throngs of people
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
at the hearing and as a result of that
 
01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
we came up with our policy of Truth and
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
sentencing that means that the the
 
01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
minimum of the sentence that imposed by
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
the judge is the amount that is served
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
before they're eligible for parole this
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
was to inspire confidence in the
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system so that a
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
sentence of two to four meant that a
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
person would be sentenced to would serve
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
at least two years before they're
 
01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
eligible for parole unless the judge
 
01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
modified their
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
sentence uh I'm and looking at 598 where
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
it says uh life without parole
 
01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
actually means life with
 
01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
parole I'm thinking of Allison
 
01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
Wonderland when Humpty Dumpty said when
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
I use a word it means what I want it to
 
01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
me neither more or neither more or less
 
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
um this house bill 138 would make the
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
minimum sentence meaningless if the
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
judge imposed two to four what does the
 
01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.590 align:start position:0%
judge imposed two to four what does the
two

01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
mean if the goal is to motivate people
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
to change their behavior there are
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
already existing provisions of the law
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
that allow them to to have opportunities
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
to get their sentence reduced rather
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
than across the board 50% discount on
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
all the sentences without requiring some
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
evidence of of effort on their part Uh
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
current RSA 5120 allows an inmate to ask
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
the court for a reduction of Maximum
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
after they serve 2third of their
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
sentence so it's already on the books if
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
they serve 2third of the minimum they
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
can go back to the judge and they can
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
make their case that they should be
 
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for parole this happens um
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
practically everybody asks for a
 
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
two-thirds reduction uh a decent number
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
of them are granted it they also uh
 
01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
often as part of the sentencing the
 
01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
judge will build into the sentence a
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
provision that if they are engage in a
 
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
particular program for example the
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
in-house drug treatment program which is
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
called Focus they would be eligible for
 
01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
six months or uh one year off their
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
minimum but in the all these in these
 
01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
cases it's the judge who is modifying
 
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
the sentence so that complies with truth
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
and sentencing the sentence imposed by
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
the judge is the sentence that's served
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
also uh the judge can authorize the
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
awarding of earn time credit uh the
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
legislature has uh provided that certain
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner can
 
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
award credit 60 120 days depending on
 
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
what program for educational behavioral
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
health or parenting programs is spelled
 
01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
out in the legislature but as as this
 
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
introduced it it's the third reason that
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to it is that it's too broad
 
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
it applies to all
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
crimes everything
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh from you know the most minor felonies
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
to to uh to to murder it applies to all
 
01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
crimes if you think sentences are too
 
01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
harsh you should change the the
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
penalties that are set out in the
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
statute you could do it one by one
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
you've already done this regarding the
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
penalties for marijuana but rather to
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
rather than painting all crimes with a
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
broad brush and saying you get a 50%
 
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.470 align:start position:0%
broad brush and saying you get a 50%
discount

01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
discount
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
um I I think is
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
misguided uh and also flies in the face
 
01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
of changing the sentence after the judge
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
has imposed it the judge who's heard all
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
the facts and listen to all the
 
01:12:27.629 --> 01:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
victims further the bill presents some
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
logistical hurdles for the parole board
 
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
if this applies to all it isn't clear
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
from the bill whether it applies to
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
those currently incarcerated or just
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
people coming in new if it applies to
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
everybody incarcerated we're going to
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
have to double the number of our parole
 
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
hearings we are already busy um with
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
fully booked on Tuesdays and Thursdays
 
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh for all day hearings and the hearings
 
01:12:54.629 --> 01:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
require 15 20 hours of
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
preparation so um that that's a lot to
 
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
ask of members of the parole board uh if
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
it applies only prospectively you're
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
going to have some people in the prison
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
who are eligible for parole at 50% and
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
some that are serving their full minimum
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
it's just it's a problem as a practical
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
matter the parole board won't release
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
anybody who hasn't completed their
 
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
programs or who has a terrible
 
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
disciplinary record so you're getting
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
people's hopes up and if they haven't
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
completed the recommended programs for
 
01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
example for drug treatment or mental
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
health uh uh anger management if they
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
haven't completed their programs we ar
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
going to give them parole
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
anyway because our primary goal is
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and people who have not
 
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
comp completed their recommended
 
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
programs are a bigger threat to Public
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
Safety um than than people who do commit
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
who do uh complete their program
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
programs so I would urge you to report
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
both bills as inexpedient to legislate
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.750 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any questions
you

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
have has a question thank you Mr
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
question there there was something that
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
you said that is really ringing in my
 
01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
ears and I think it was along the lines
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
of a person that is serving a life
 
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
sentence well I guess really it's only
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
going to be half of that before they're
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
eligible for PE so really what is going
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
on so with that being said can you maybe
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
give us an
 
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.310 align:start position:0%
give us an
example

01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
of I I know that you're necessarily not
 
01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
that person would be feeling this but
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
given what you do you know for a living
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
for a maybe an example of for a family
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
that has a family member that was the
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
victim of one of these crimes that is so
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
horrendous is the person who's put been
 
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
put in prison for life and now because
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
25 years come along they're they're
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for parole what would
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
that be like for a family to have to
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
continue you know to relive the
 
01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:02.679 align:start position:0%
nightmare all over again when they
 
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
thought they at least had some some kind
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
of closure to give involment their life
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that for victims of
 
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
crimes serious crimes even burglaries um
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
when the victims come in every time
 
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
there is a parole hearing it's like the
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
crime was committed yesterday
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
they have to revisit all those emotions
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
it is so painful for the victims who
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
have to come in and appear at a parole
 
01:15:38.669 --> 01:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
hearing and in many cases the uh inmate
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be ready for parole and
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
so they are entitled to another
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
hearing uh within six months if they
 
01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
denied parole
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
and every
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
time that there is a parole hearing the
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
victims uh have to relive the
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
trauma with regard to changing the the
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
sentence I can remember a case where a a
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
young girl had been victimized by her
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
neighbor she she had been
 
01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
repeatedly uh
 
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
raped the sentence that they worked
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
out uh to avoid a trial was a negotiated
 
01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
plea the
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
inmate the offender was sent
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
to a certain amount of time so that he
 
01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible for role until she
 
01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
was away at College in between the
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislature enacted these earn time
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
credits so the guy was eligible for
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
parole before she went away to college
 
01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
and I can't tell you how traumatic that
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
was for for the for the girl and for her
 
01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
family so I'm glad you brought up the
 
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
effect that this kind of policy change
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
there any other oh repres has a question
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you very much
 
01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:04.110 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:06.110 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
[Music]

01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
um you you admit I believe you said that
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire 85% of prisoners get
 
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
paroled by that
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
sentence are you saying that
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
85% don't serve their
 
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
maximum right the the uh the sentencing
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
policy in New Hampshire is they uh
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
impose a minimum and a maximum they are
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for parole at their
 
01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.550 align:start position:0%
eligible for parole at their
minimum

01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.189 align:start position:0%
minimum
so

01:17:38.189 --> 01:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
85 I don't have the exact numbers but
 
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's very high compared to NA
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
national standards 85% of the people
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
will hear will hear on a given Thursday
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
will be granted
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
parole uh that may be because they were
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
they met all the criteria by the time of
 
01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
their minimum a lot of them will
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
postpone their hearing knowing that we
 
01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
would deny them until they completed
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
programs and so they'll wait until their
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
programs are completed uh to apply for
 
01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh we don't parole everybody we don't
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
parole 85% at their exact minimum we
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
parole about 85% of the people who come
 
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
before us some are at their minimum some
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
are a little beyond their minimum some
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
waited uh because they needed to find
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
housing needed to complete a program but
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the cases we hear a large number are
 
01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.310 align:start position:0%
of the cases we hear a large number are
granted

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
granted
 
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
parole can I answer your question yes
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
ma'am I do have thank you Mr chair I do
 
01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
have one more question man' if you would
 
01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
take it um because I don't understand
 
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
how the Pool Works
 
01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
um prisoners must serve their minimum
 
01:18:56.669 --> 01:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
sentence so for example in a in a two to
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
four sentence your sentence two to four
 
01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.030 align:start position:0%
four sentence your sentence two to four
years

01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so okay so two to four means they're
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
eligible for parole at the two-year spot
 
01:19:08.159 --> 01:19:09.189 align:start position:0%
eligible for parole at the two-year spot
the

01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:09.199 --> 01:19:10.910 align:start position:0%
the
two-year

01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
two-year
 
01:19:13.470 --> 01:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
point it means that if they're released
 
01:19:16.629 --> 01:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
then they are on parole for until four
 
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
years so two years behind the walls two
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
years in the community under parole
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:26.229 align:start position:0%
years in the community under parole
supervision

01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you ma'am so my question
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
would be if they if they earn a whole
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
bunch of uh time off
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
credits does that reduce them uh for uh
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
for it changes their
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
minimum it changes their minimum a lot
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
of times the judge will say if you
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
complete the focus program you can have
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
a year off and so they uh have a a 3 to
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
six they complete the focus program
 
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
there their sentence changes to 2 to
 
01:20:03.629 --> 01:20:03.639 align:start position:0%
six thank thank you
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
ma'am but this is all done with with the
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
judge's approval just
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
to be consistent with the policy that
 
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
the sentence imposed by the the minimum
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
sentence imposed by the judge is a
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.629 align:start position:0%
 
served

01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
served
 
01:20:23.639 --> 01:20:31.110 align:start position:0%
served
I'm

01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
no thank you Mr chair um and uh thank
 
01:20:41.709 --> 01:20:41.719 align:start position:0%
you to uh speaker s say for for taking
 
01:20:45.629 --> 01:20:45.639 align:start position:0%
my question um in situations like murder
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
without parole or murder sentences with
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
additional penalties of crimes um there
 
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
appears to be no minimum in that case
 
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
and are are people in that
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
situation not uh
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh not eligible for parole or to apply
 
01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
for parole even though they may have um
 
01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
completed all of the
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
requirements um and maybe even got
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
degrees and are helpful at the prison
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
and whatever and maybe even the victim's
 
01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
family is in would be in favor of the
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
parole if it was asked for
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
possibility somebody is uh serving a
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
life without
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
parole they can't get it reduced unless
 
01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
they go back to the judge for a sentence
 
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
reduction they don't get the benefit of
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
credits and would that
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
followup and that would also be the case
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
for someone who
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
has a murder sentence and do all murder
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
sentences that are had that um do not
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
include the part about no eligibility
 
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
for parole do they have a minimum
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
sentence always associated with that
 
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
life sentence yeah thank you very much
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
yes they do thank
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
you con thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
speaker so if we've heard today that 85%
 
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire inmates are for that
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
suggests to me this is a useful
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
inducement for good behavior and
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
reform uh and trying to better on do
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
that same standard apply to inmates
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
serving life without parole do you feel
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
as though that that would be uh the kind
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
of inducement to dis behave themselves
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
some kind of hope that uh they could
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
L the the parole board is not a
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
resentencing body we just abide by the
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
sentence imposed by the judge uh as an
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
observation uh lifers tend not to be
 
01:22:59.679 --> 01:23:01.550 align:start position:0%
observation uh lifers tend not to be
disciplinary

01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
problems it's surprising people who are
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
doing life without parole who are
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
serving long sentences are not
 
01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
disciplinary problems and surprisingly
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
sex offenders are not disciplinary
 
01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.390 align:start position:0%
sex offenders are not disciplinary
problems

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
generally sex offenders have to usually
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
plan their life so they they they know
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
how to control their behavior because
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
had to groom their victims in many cases
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
so that that was a a surprise to me they
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
aren't the disciplinary problems the
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
disciplinary problems of the younger
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
people who were there for drugs and
 
01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
burglaries and theft by unauthorized
 
01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:42.510 align:start position:0%
burglaries and theft by unauthorized
taking

01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
assaults question thank you Mr chairman
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh for taking this
 
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
unrelated follow um you mentioned
 
01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.070 align:start position:0%
unrelated follow um you mentioned
earlier

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh a case that seemed to Spur New
 
01:23:57.629 --> 01:23:57.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's truth and
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
sentencing uh
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
changes um is there more to it than that
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
or did that one case uh encourage the
 
01:24:09.629 --> 01:24:09.639 align:start position:0%
law to change in New Hampshire is there
 
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
more to truth and sentencing changes in
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or is it just a single
 
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
case the impetus for truth and
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
sentencing was the potential release of
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
Edward kulage
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.149 align:start position:0%
 
Mason

01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
Mason
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
um murdered and raped her and threw her
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
body in the maram river it was an
 
01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
outrageous crime that terrorized the
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
community because there had been a
 
01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
number of other similar murders of
 
01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.750 align:start position:0%
number of other similar murders of
teenage

01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
teenage
 
01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.350 align:start position:0%
teenage
babysitters

01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
babysitters
 
01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
um and when he was be he was given a
 
01:24:48.199 --> 01:24:49.229 align:start position:0%
um and when he was be he was given a
life

01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
sentence life at that time meant uh 18
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
years he had accumulated I I believe you
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
know 8 years of pre-trial credit or
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
something uh anyway he was eligible for
 
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
release about 10 years after he he went
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
to the prison the family was outraged
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
the community was outraged there were
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
petitions that were presented to the
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee which used to have
 
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
uh jurisdiction over criminal justice
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
issues uh I was chairman of the
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
committee at the time um
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
there there was a demand that we do
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
something about this and the answer was
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
truth and sentencing so that the
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
sentence imposed would be the sentence
 
01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
served and they said well where is the
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
incentive for them to behave themselves
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
if they just have to serve their their
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
minimum we put in a provision and this
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
is in every mimus um your sentence to
 
01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
two to four and to the sentence is added
 
01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
150 days of disciplinary time which they
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
work off off at 12 and a half days a
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
month so instead of giving a discount
 
01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
for good behavior we add on for bad
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
behavior so somebody who escapes loses
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
all his uh the 150 days that he had uh
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
might have earned off the The Sur charge
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%

Bradley you chairman and thank you for

um do you have any um data about the
 
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
impact of Truth and sentencing on the
 
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
population I'm sorry I couldn't I
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear you the audio wasn't very
 
01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
good sorry can you hear me now that's
 
01:26:39.149 --> 01:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
better okay sorry um do you have any
 
01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
data about the impact of Truth and
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
sentencing on the New Hampshire
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
population oh it certainly increased the
 
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh prison
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
population significantly we thought at
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
the time that the judges would modify
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
their sentences to reflect that
 
01:26:55.950 --> 01:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
everybody had to serve their minimum the
 
01:26:59.070 --> 01:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
judges didn't do that so our prison
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you chair uh thank you for
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
um so if someone comes up for parole and
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
they are not granted parole uh when's
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
the next time they can apply for parole
 
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh when they are not granted parole we
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
have to give them a reason we denied
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
them and they have to meet certain
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
conditions okay we're denying your
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
parole today because you don't have a
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
solid housing plan come back to us when
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
you've got a solid housing plan we're
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
denying you parole today because you
 
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
haven't completed the focus program come
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
back to us when you are close to
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
completion of the focus program so we
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
have to give them a reason and when they
 
01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
meet that the criteria that we said they
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
board followup followup question thank
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
you chair thank you taking my question
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
um if we were to double the number of
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
probe uh hearings uh how would uh you
 
01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:12.270 align:start position:0%
probe uh hearings uh how would uh you
handle

01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
that I don't know they have to add
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
another day of
 
01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:19.960 align:start position:0%

hearings is you know
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
15 15 maybe 20 hours of preparation and
 
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.109 --> 01:28:45.119 align:start position:0%

people who make $100 a year I recognize
that

01:28:55.470 --> 01:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%

adjustments to uh the proboard uh uh
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
compensation last that was that uh that
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
was part of the bill that died is not
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
part of this bill uh part of the U House
 
01:29:14.109 --> 01:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
Bill two makes a complete change to the
 
01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
the structure and compensation of the
 
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
parole board but that's in House Bill
 
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
too right now we're at 100 100 $ $100 a
 
01:29:26.109 --> 01:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
day thank you very much in order to
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
prepare for an extra day of hearings it
 
01:29:32.669 --> 01:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
would require a lot more staff time to
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
prepare all the packets all the
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
information we need we typically we
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
could get you know 75 or 100 Pages for
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
each of the cases that we have to read
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
so they have to assemble all that data
 
01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
for us and then provide it and we have
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
see representa Muse you
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
recognized yes thank you for taking my
 
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
question um one of the things that we
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
heard uh last year when we reviewed the
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
results of the audit was that there were
 
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of inefficiencies in the parole
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
board a lot of them were budget related
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
um a lot of them were resource related
 
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
um related to not having enough staff
 
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things I'm I guess I guess
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
that I'm curious about is that
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
if if there was a way to actually make
 
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
the parole board more uh efficient and
 
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
maybe some of the things in in House
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 uh are targeted at doing that but
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
if there was a way to do that uh would
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
there would you still have the same
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
degree of concern with uh the increased
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
number of of cases in the case load the
 
01:30:58.109 --> 01:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
reason for killing these bills isn't
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
because of the increased workload on on
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
the parole board the reason for killing
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
them is is that it's a bad policy House
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 uh proposes a uh dramatic change
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
in the in the structure and the
 
01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
operation of the board uh it makes a
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%
full-time paid chairman uh gives us an
 
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
extra person in the office to help
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
prepare all the information we need to
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
make a parole decision and uh increases
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:35.709 --> 01:31:35.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
you see seeing no further hands raised I
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%

although I believe the facts supported a
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
first deegree this bill would allow him
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
to seek Pat parole after only two 12 and
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
a half years while that period has

classifications and client records at

the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
Corrections I'm speaking on behalf of
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
the department in opposition to House
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 598 I have submitted written
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
testimony regarding our position I'll
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
Briefly summarize uh our reasons for
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
this although speaker scitech had
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
actually uh kind of stole a lot of the
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
Thunder that I was going to present so
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'll will try not to reiterate
 
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
everything that she said um in regards
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
to truth and sentencing currently the
 
01:35:57.149 --> 01:35:57.159 align:start position:0%
offenders are required to complete 100%
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
of their minimum but due to earn time
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
credit laws and also six RSA 65120 they
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to get their sentences their
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
minimum and maximum sentences reduced
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
six months ago RSA 651a 22A for earn
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
time credit was just expanded to allow
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
for many more opportunities for uh
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
residents to apply for earn time credit
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
they can get up to 21 months or 630 days
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
of earn time credit against their
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
sentence um a lot more of programming is
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
available now that we have tablets uh
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
Correctional Research Institute where
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
they can get 60 days for some programs
 
01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
completed as well as multiple vocational
 
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
programs where before they could only
 
01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
get it one time reduction um if passed
 
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
household 598 would have a drastic
 
01:36:44.109 --> 01:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
impact on the ability of our department
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
to provide recommended programming for
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
the residents prior to being eligible
 
01:36:47.679 --> 01:36:48.669 align:start position:0%
the residents prior to being eligible
for

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:48.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
parole for the most part most of the
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
residents go into their intensive
 
01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
programs whether it be the focus program
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
as scitec spoke about or the sex Fender
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
treatment program they don't go into
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
those programs till about two years to
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
their minimum due to needing those
 
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
skills that they learn in the programs
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
to apply to their re-entry into society
 
01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
um currently if if this bill is passed
 
01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
we would we would be able to provide
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
that programming without a major
 
01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
increase in staff um or areas of
 
01:37:19.870 --> 01:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
programming to be available to
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
us um we would recommend this bill be
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
sent to a study committee on truth and
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
sentencing which was proposed last year
 
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
in Senate Bill
 
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
438 um I can take any questions that
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
anyone has uh even following up for
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%

01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
question uh the last speaker
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh
 
01:37:55.149 --> 01:37:55.159 align:start position:0%
medical reasons for having your sentence
 
01:37:59.310 --> 01:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
reduced in the hundreds of emails I
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
got um that was sent you know with
 
01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
people's names on it from a certain
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
group U they mentioned the high cost of
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
medical is that possible for you know
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
somebody that's elderly and has major
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
health issues to get
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
released yes thank you for the question
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
um medical parole is an option it is I
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to say few and far between
 
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
but it is not as common as there are a
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
lengthy process that is started by the
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
medical department at the doc um when
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
they have to vet the amount the
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
treatment going to cost in addition to
 
01:38:36.189 --> 01:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
um if this individual is going to be a
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
danger to society If released and then
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
that all gets uh put together and you
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
know the parole board here is for
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
medical parole and my current position
 
01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
I've been in it for about three years I
 
01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:48.950 align:start position:0%
I've been in it for about three years I
have

01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
seen maybe two or three people relas
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
leased on medical
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
parole um it's it's not as common but it
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:05.589 --> 01:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
you representative poer thank you Mr
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh for taking my
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
question um because of Co I know that
 
01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:16.360 align:start position:0%
some of the programs in in J and prison
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
are not available such as 12 step
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
programs are the programs aailable to
 
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
inmates to actually complete the
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
prerequisites before they're eligible
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
for Paro or could successfully get roll
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
co uh thank you for the question uh
 
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
currently right now we did have two
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
Focus programs for drug treatment the
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
Intensive drug treatment program running
 
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
one in conquete and one up in the burin
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
facility uh due to staffing issues we
 
01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
had to temporarily suspend the one in
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
conquered and we are currently moving
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
anyone on the list for focus is up to uh
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
the Berlin facility so they can complete
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
it in a timely manner due to the opioid
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
epidemic that we've been dealing with
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
for the past few years the list for
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
focus is extremely high um a lot of
 
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
parole violators come back and are
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
assessed for needing intensive treatment
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
and due to not completing it in the in
 
01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
the community um failing drug court
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
other issues they need to complete that
 
01:40:19.149 --> 01:40:19.159 align:start position:0%
prior to being released so they kind of
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
take a a jump ahead of some of these
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
other individuals that are sentenced
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
instead of pro violators so but we do
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
have programs running sex offender
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
treatment programs running our intensive
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
programs are all running I can't speak
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
to some of the minor level of programs
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
that we do have but I know that they are
 
01:40:39.229 --> 01:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
um still doing a lot of programs that
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
we've had available in the
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
past thank
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
news thank you Mr chair um and thank you
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um um one of the
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
things that I'm curious about is the
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
potential uh impact of uh of this year's
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
Budget on some of the programs that
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
you're referring to uh so my
 
01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
understanding is that last week uh
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks uh testified in front
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the finance committee that uh a
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
couple of the halfway houses uh and some
 
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
of the educational programs for inmates
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh would need to be would need to be
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
shut down and I guess if a reason to
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
keep people uh in prison and so they can
 
01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
take these programs the assump the
 
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
assumption would be that the programs
 
01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
would need to be there uh so that they
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
could be completed so what I'm what I'm
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
curious about is are any of the programs
 
01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
that uh that people would need to to to
 
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
take as a or complete as a as a
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
condition of release uh basically under
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
Threat by the current
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
budget uh I would thank you for the
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
question I would would currently say no
 
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
because most of the programs that are
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
required by the parole board are our the
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
Intensive programs that we still have
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
running um there are alternatives to
 
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
some of the Lesser ones like anger
 
01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
management there you know before I came
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
to the doc that was an full Anger
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
Management program that has been more of
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
a one-on-one or a smaller group so to
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
speak that they complete I know and
 
01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately if that does come to pass
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
that the half the halfway houses get
 
01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
closed um so our residents that were in
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
the halfway houses on work release are
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
taking AER Management in the community
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
while they're on work release to be able
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
to have that uh when they go up for
 
01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further hands raised the
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
witness is excused I want to thank you
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
for your
 
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you chel recognizes
 
01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.589 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you chel recognizes
Donna

01:42:49.589 --> 01:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.589 --> 01:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
Brown hi hello this is attorney Donna
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
Brown in Manchester I am speaking today
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
01:42:59.669 --> 01:42:59.679 align:start position:0%
Association of criminal defense
 
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys I myself have been a criminal
 
01:43:05.709 --> 01:43:05.719 align:start position:0%
defense attorney for over 30 years uh a
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
great uh part of that time was as a
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
public defender uh after the last five
 
01:43:13.589 --> 01:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
or six years I've been in private
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
practice um uh I found it very
 
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
interesting to listen to the other Donna
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
Donna scitec today and I I agreed with a
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
lot of what she said except for the
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
result I I should clarify I am only
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
speaking today on behalf of how House
 
01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 598 at which is regarding truth and
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
sentencing and I don't plan to address
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh the uh change in the call them lwop
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
or lifer bill so I'm only going to
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
address uh uh the the basically repeal
 
01:43:51.990 --> 01:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
of of Truth and sent sentencing uh
 
01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's a saying that's been
 
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
around for a long time that say hard
 
01:43:59.229 --> 01:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
cases make bad law um and you can I can
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
think of a hundred cases I remember when
 
01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature moved the juvenile age
 
01:44:07.589 --> 01:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
from 18 down to 17 it was one really bad
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
case um and but the you know
 
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
99% of juvenile cases should have stayed
 
01:44:18.589 --> 01:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
or n you know 90% of 17y olds should
 
01:44:20.669 --> 01:44:20.679 align:start position:0%
have been addressed in the uh in the
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
juvenal justice system and not the um
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
adult system and that was changed
 
01:44:27.589 --> 01:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
several years back to make it back to to
 
01:44:31.229 --> 01:44:31.239 align:start position:0%
18 and you know there's lots of cases
 
01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
attorney I mean attorney uh a pro board
 
01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
member scitech talked about the Edward
 
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
coolage case um another uh person who
 
01:44:42.589 --> 01:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
testified talked about another murder uh
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
but the overwhelming majority of the
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
people that would be affected by this
 
01:44:52.589 --> 01:44:52.599 align:start position:0%
would be uh inmates who committed um
 
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
nonviolent offenses uh and and that's
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
why you know in order to avoid someone
 
01:45:02.350 --> 01:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
like Edward kulage getting out early New
 
01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire decided we're going to
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
increase our prison population from 200
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
to several thousand in the course of a
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
few decades and so that's what happens
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
is this kind of one-size fits all of of
 
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're always going to be
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
looking at the the terrible murder case
 
01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to fix the issue
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
with the with the other inmates and and
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that there's ways to
 
01:45:30.990 --> 01:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
address that I I do agree with um uh
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
Pearl board member scitec that um cases
 
01:45:38.189 --> 01:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
aren't retried uh in fact I would I
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
would strongly recommend it against
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
anyone going to the PE board and saying
 
01:45:43.229 --> 01:45:43.239 align:start position:0%
I'm innocent they got the wrong guy but
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
let me out that doesn't usually work too
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
well uh but uh usually the there there
 
01:45:50.830 --> 01:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
is some relevance though to the
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
underlying crime and that is that if you
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
went to prison for horrific violent or
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
sexual or both type of crime the pl
 
01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
board wants to make sure you're not that
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
same person anymore that you whatever
 
01:46:07.149 --> 01:46:07.159 align:start position:0%
LED you to do that be it drugs or uh
 
01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:09.639 align:start position:0%
some defect that that you've done
 
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
something about that uh and so that's
 
01:46:15.790 --> 01:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
what I you know that's how that does
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
come into the plle board and I've been
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
to plle board hearings for people who
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
have had convictions for second deegree
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
murder as I think someone explained
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
earlier you don't get Paro for first
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
deegree murder but for second degree
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
murder you do and those are you know
 
01:46:33.589 --> 01:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
usually they last an hour an hour and a
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
half usually the Attorney General's
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
office comes to those hearings with the
 
01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
victim Advocate with um many times
 
01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
family members um from the victim there
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
there there there are separate type of
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
Ro hearing for those hearings but the
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
that I I say that because it's important
 
01:46:51.790 --> 01:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
to remember and I know it's been said
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
already that there there is a second
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
step that by changing um truth and
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
sentencing you're not letting people out
 
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
all you're doing is changing parole
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility so if you if you did have
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
someone who you lowered um the the time
 
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
the period of time from when they could
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
come before the P Board there's still
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
going to be notification of the victim's
 
01:47:15.790 --> 01:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
family there's still going to be a
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
chance to object and and and as I said
 
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
almost every hearing I've had um the um
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
prosecution has said here's something
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
about the crime that you parole board
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
should know in deciding whether he's
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
ready to go back into the community so
 
01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
those things are addressed um as I I
 
01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
said I Our concern is that we'll we'll
 
01:47:41.310 --> 01:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
we'll focus on one or two horrific
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
crimes to the to not looking at the vast
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
majority of cases where this would
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
benefit the community where this would
 
01:47:54.910 --> 01:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
would benefit families um uh and be the
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
more fiscally responsible thing to do as
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
as well as the right thing to do um one
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
thing I've seen over the years over and
 
01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
over and over that when when you give
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
someone a long sentence and the only the
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
people who get long sentences aren't
 
01:48:09.629 --> 01:48:09.639 align:start position:0%
just you know people charged with rape
 
01:48:12.149 --> 01:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
or sexual assault and murder um there
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
are some uh drug offenses there are
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
people doing 10 years on uh drug
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
offenses and when you put someone in
 
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
prison for that long of time you're
 
01:48:22.589 --> 01:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
really increasing the chance that their
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
children will grow up in poverty that
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
their children will not have child
 
01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
support that their children will not
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
have uh a father um who is on the
 
01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
outside to uh help them uh you know
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
monetarily whether they're in the family
 
01:48:42.669 --> 01:48:42.679 align:start position:0%
or not so um the cost isn't the extra
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know couple thousand of people that
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
are in the prison the cost uh goes
 
01:48:50.189 --> 01:48:50.199 align:start position:0%
throughout our society in terms of of uh
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
helping children um who aren't going to
 
01:48:55.950 --> 01:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
have at least one parent who can help
 
01:48:59.310 --> 01:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
with the cost of their them being raised
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
um and I think that is all I have to say
 
01:49:04.270 --> 01:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
and if anyone has any questions I I
 
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:08.920 align:start position:0%

today lask and I will be representing
 
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
the American civil liberties Union of
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in support of HB
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
598 and I urge this committee to vote a
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
to pass on this
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
legislation as we've heard um throughout
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
the 70s all the way up to the 90s the US
 
01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
adopted this punishment only um get
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
tough on crime perspective towards uh
 
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
policies in the criminal justice system
 
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
and we did see things like the three
 
01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
strikes laws mandatory minimums and
 
01:50:27.629 --> 01:50:27.639 align:start position:0%
truth and sentencing and when truth and
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
sentencing was first enacted in uh 1984
 
01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire enacted in 1982 it
 
01:50:34.830 --> 01:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
required states to increase the length
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
of prison time if person was
 
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for and prove that they had
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
served no less than an 85% minimum
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
portion of their sentence established by
 
01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.069 align:start position:0%
portion of their sentence established by
federal

01:50:45.069 --> 01:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines um with the passage of Truth
 
01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
and sentencing things like parole
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility and good in good time
 
01:50:53.069 --> 01:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
credits um were restricted and in some
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
cases effectively
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
eliminated the original Federal truth
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
and sentencing guidelines required only
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
an 85% of minimums to be served however
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire decided to distinguish
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
Itself by adopting the harshest and most
 
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
extreme version of this policy 100% um
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
across the board truth and sentencing is
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
a onrack minded policy that impedes
 
01:51:20.069 --> 01:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation it is punitive oriented
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
it requires people to serve a blanket
 
01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
percentage across the board regardless
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
if they're rehabilitated or not and it
 
01:51:27.310 --> 01:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't Foster an environment that would
 
01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
be conducive to individuals changing the
 
01:51:32.589 --> 01:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
behavior that even landed them in prison
 
01:51:34.990 --> 01:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
I know one concern um that has come up
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
is that HB 598 would open the floodgates
 
01:51:39.069 --> 01:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
of the prison system and everyone would
 
01:51:41.069 --> 01:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
be let out and I and I just want to make
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
it very clear this bill does not do that
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
all HB 598 does is allow a person to
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
have a hearing before the New Hampshire
 
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
Adult Parole Board and have them make an
 
01:51:53.229 --> 01:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
informed decision about whether or not
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
to Grant the privilege of
 
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
parole this this means a lot to me
 
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
because you know I I I don't know what
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's like to you know be a a legislator
 
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
or to to write laws or whatnot but what
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
I do know is the effects of policies I
 
01:52:12.910 --> 01:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
myself have served 13 years incarcerated
 
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire prison system I
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
have seen um every aspect of the parole
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
I have seen um
 
01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:21.470 align:start position:0%
I have seen um
how

01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation um is fostered and how it
 
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
gets snuffed out and I can tell you that
 
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
truth and sentencing as it is this
 
01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
policy does not promote Rehabilitation
 
01:52:36.270 --> 01:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
and is anti- um what we are looking for
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
for re-entering Society members I wanted
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
to just address like just a couple of
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we heard about 85% of
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
people will be granted um parole that
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
goes in front of the parole board uh
 
01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
that does not that number it doesn't
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
represent individuals getting parole on
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
their minimum and one of the biggest
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
things is having to wait for your
 
01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
programs to be completed which will take
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
people over their minimum sentences
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
so one there's not a truth in the
 
01:53:08.430 --> 01:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
sentencing that you're getting because
 
01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
you're not that the time that you're
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
doing that you're sentenced to as a
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
minimum oftentimes is not the time that
 
01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
you end up doing and when we look at
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
this you know we were we were told that
 
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
this is oh
 
01:53:23.069 --> 01:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
oh uh the time that you're sentenced to
 
01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
that is the time that um you know you're
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
going to do but you're adding bad time
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
to a sentence that mentality means that
 
01:53:34.270 --> 01:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
you're automatically assuming people who
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
are going to the prison system are going
 
01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
to continue that behavior that type of
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
mentality and that message does not
 
01:53:44.669 --> 01:53:44.679 align:start position:0%
promote Rehabilitation and it does not
 
01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:47.679 align:start position:0%
it doesn't Foster it at all and the
 
01:53:51.069 --> 01:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
provision about the 2/3 um being granted
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
parole that you know we heard that
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
everyone asks for ask for it everyone
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
does ask for it because everyone wants
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
to have a hope they want something to
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
believe in and the truth is very few
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
people get a two-thirds granted because
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
you're petitioning the court you're
 
01:54:09.149 --> 01:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
petitioning a sentencing judge who only
 
01:54:12.430 --> 01:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
saw the facts of your case that sent you
 
01:54:14.589 --> 01:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
to prison you're asking that individual
 
01:54:16.510 --> 01:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
to review what you've done and be
 
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
granted parole often times people do not
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
get a two3
 
01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:22.430 align:start position:0%
get a two3
sentence

01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
and I know that this this bill was is is
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
is said to you know Inspire confidence
 
01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
but this bill does not Inspire
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
confidence truth and sentencing does not
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
Inspire confidence in the system it
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
really only makes the system look
 
01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
extreme and
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
inhumane and and and the reason why it
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
does that is you the earn time credit
 
01:54:46.109 --> 01:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
system that is there a judge has to
 
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
approve that on a minimum sentence
 
01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
because if they don't a person would
 
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
have to file go through this whole
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
process of filing a motion just to even
 
01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
get the um the earn time credits and
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
there is great there is a reason to have
 
01:55:01.709 --> 01:55:01.719 align:start position:0%
concern over that because of the budget
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
of the the the budget announcement the
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
earn time credit system is pretty much
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
built on every single program that would
 
01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
be effectively cut from the budget um if
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
if if that is what is is is happens and
 
01:55:17.790 --> 01:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
I can and I can speak to that um more
 
01:55:19.229 --> 01:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
this is not going to double parole
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
hearing in the sense that it's the same
 
01:55:23.069 --> 01:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
amount of people who would be going up
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
for parole whether you're doing it at
 
01:55:26.589 --> 01:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
50% of your minimum or you're doing it
 
01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
at 100% it's still the same amount of
 
01:55:29.950 --> 01:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
people that would be getting parole so
 
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's not going to double the amount of
 
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
parole hearings it's just going to make
 
01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
people eligible to go in front of the
 
01:55:38.189 --> 01:55:38.199 align:start position:0%
parole board and see if they've been
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated and meet the requirements
 
01:55:41.199 --> 01:55:43.069 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated and meet the requirements
of

01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
parole we
 
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:47.560 align:start position:0%
heard talking about the um the Intensive
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
programs that um that are running that
 
01:55:52.589 --> 01:55:52.599 align:start position:0%
are that are used if the Intensive
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
programs are the only things that are
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
used to gauge um the rehabilitative
 
01:56:00.910 --> 01:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
nature of a person then I I really
 
01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:03.719 align:start position:0%
caution what we are doing when when we
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
are looking at how people are ending up
 
01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
in front of the parole board without um
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
completing educational um programs and
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
and how they are rehabilitated we have
 
01:56:16.350 --> 01:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
to see that individuals need to be given
 
01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
a chance to continue that growth instead
 
01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
of remaining in environment that is
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to pull them in the opposite
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
direction nothing about prison
 
01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:26.719 align:start position:0%
intrinsically will push people towards
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation you have to go get it
 
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
yourself and that has to be
 
01:56:33.069 --> 01:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
incentivized and for these reasons and
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
many more that I support HP 598 I am
 
01:56:37.149 --> 01:56:37.159 align:start position:0%

01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%

other thank
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%

repeat that just one if I have a
 
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
preference for what which one we've
 
01:57:25.709 --> 01:57:25.719 align:start position:0%
heard follow may I
 
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:27.960 align:start position:0%

01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh yes we
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
have heard testimony about parole and
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony about resentencing
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
hearings and I would just like to know
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
if you have a preference of one of those
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
over the other as in order um to
 
01:57:55.310 --> 01:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
accomplish um people being um whatever
 
01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question uh
 
01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
represent um yes I do have a preference
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
I of parole and the reason why is when
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
you do a resentencing hearing first of
 
01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
all now you are taking on um petitioning
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
a court
 
01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
system and that that's going to that's
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to have a financial cost to both
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
um the state who has to um represent um
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know the state's interest in that
 
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's a financial cost to the
 
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
individual who is um putting in the
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
motion and often times people don't have
 
01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
of the financial resources to to
 
01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
petition a court to say hey I really
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
think that I qualify for being
 
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated based on what I've done
 
01:58:41.390 --> 01:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
when you have parole what happens is
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
you're you're not always granted parole
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
and what what happens is they get to
 
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
they get to view things differently they
 
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
get to see a more detailed um report and
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
a more detailed uh record of what you
 
01:59:01.109 --> 01:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
have done during your incarceration um
 
01:59:04.109 --> 01:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
sentence to to be granted parole I could
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
speak for myself personally um during
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
the first eight years of my sentence I I
 
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
was not the um I wasn't the ideal um or
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
model inmate by far by a long
 
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
shot and the parole board treated me as
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
such when I when the last five years of
 
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
my sentence after I had um become became
 
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated and I had changed I
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
changed my behavior and it and it showed
 
01:59:32.669 --> 01:59:32.679 align:start position:0%
the parole board was able to make that
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
determination and was able to comment on
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
the the the steps that I had taken they
 
01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
were able to see it they were able to
 
01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:40.719 align:start position:0%
talk about it and to and say this is
 
01:59:42.030 --> 01:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
what we are looking for this is what we
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
are trying to do I mean the pull parole
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
hearing was recorded So I I personally
 
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
feel and what I've seen that being able
 
01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
to go in front of the parole board to
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
make your case and to have that heard um
 
01:59:54.990 --> 01:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
is much better because then you then you
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
know what you're working on you know
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay well I can go back in front of them
 
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
if I work on this and and and it's a
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
wakeup call then trying to spend money
 
02:00:03.870 --> 02:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
to go back in front of a court to get a
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
court hearing and and go through that
 
02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:07.550 align:start position:0%
court hearing and and go through that
whole

02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
whole
 
02:00:10.589 --> 02:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
process thank you very
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
much representative B you recognize for
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:00:20.109 --> 02:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um if we pass
 
02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
598 uh and um someone has sentenced a 3
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
to six year uh uh
 
02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
term and they get off with half of the
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
minimum serve my understanding from
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier today they would be uh
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
on parole for the next four and a half
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
years uh what is life like on parole is
 
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
it really uh uh much better than
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
prison it is a world it is a Universe um
 
02:00:58.589 --> 02:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
different than being in prison from
 
02:01:02.069 --> 02:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
being on parole when so I'm I'm
 
02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
currently on parole and I will be on
 
02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
parole for the next five years and my
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
journey has revealed so many things that
 
02:01:11.069 --> 02:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
I I did not know um or subtle
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
differences um to be able to wake just
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
just something so simple as to be able
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
to wake up and look out your window and
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
not see a 35t tall barb wire wall but to
 
02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
see maybe a tree or outside that is a
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
big difference and what that does is
 
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:26.910 align:start position:0%
big difference and what that does is
that

02:01:26.910 --> 02:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
inspires connection to the community
 
02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
that that's a reinforcement I have moved
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
past prison I am now in the community I
 
02:01:38.669 --> 02:01:38.679 align:start position:0%
am going to continue doing the right
 
02:01:41.470 --> 02:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
thing right something so small as that
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
being on parole means that you are still
 
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
being held accountable and that you have
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
structure to
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
continue the rehabilitative journey that
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
you have started I have I have to you
 
02:01:54.189 --> 02:01:54.199 align:start position:0%
know I have to check in with my parole
 
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
officer I have to let him know
 
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
everything that I'm doing I have to uh
 
02:02:01.390 --> 02:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
ask his permission to to do things but
 
02:02:03.870 --> 02:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
he also sets goals you know you could
 
02:02:05.589 --> 02:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
see while you've been working for this
 
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
many months straight you have done this
 
02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
you have been um of good behavior you
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
get that you get that relationship um
 
02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
where you are your parole officer is
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
there to encourage you and push you in
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
the right direction because you've made
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
parole prison does is that's not their
 
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
job they're only there to make sure that
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
they keep security and that you do your
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
requirements it becomes the difference
 
02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
between being on parole and being in
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
prison is one is transactional when
 
02:02:36.750 --> 02:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
you're in prison you are solely a number
 
02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
you're referred to by a number that is
 
02:02:41.069 --> 02:02:41.079 align:start position:0%
it you are not a human you are a number
 
02:02:44.109 --> 02:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
your parole officer is to humanize you
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
because you have been rehabilitated and
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
to continue that
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
growth thank you representative BT you
 
02:02:53.470 --> 02:02:53.480 align:start position:0%

testimony um you stated that
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
if uh the
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
prisoner uh no if programs you know that
 
02:03:08.109 --> 02:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
the prisoners take or assigned to them
 
02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
are are not completed within their
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
sentence that they will not be granted
 
02:03:16.830 --> 02:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
parole do you have any statistics or you
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
know paperwork that you could show that
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's the case where you know people
 
02:03:23.470 --> 02:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
that are not completing you know do not
 
02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:25.639 align:start position:0%
qualify for
 
02:03:27.870 --> 02:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
perole uh yeah it's it's on it's a
 
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
parole requirement um that is a that is
 
02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
a doc and uh and I believe a court
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
requirement when the court sentences you
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
to um to prison they will put it on your
 
02:03:41.950 --> 02:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
Minimus so it'll be on your on your
 
02:03:45.709 --> 02:03:45.719 align:start position:0%
Minimus it will have a a specific um uh
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
order from the judge which will say you
 
02:03:49.390 --> 02:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
have to complete
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh the focus program during your
 
02:03:54.510 --> 02:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
incarceration or what the judge may say
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
is you must complete any and all Doc
 
02:04:01.390 --> 02:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
required programming and what that means
 
02:04:03.790 --> 02:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
is then the doc can say well we're going
 
02:04:05.229 --> 02:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
to do an assessment on you when you
 
02:04:07.709 --> 02:04:07.719 align:start position:0%
first come in and and this happens in
 
02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
R&amp;D when you first come in within the
 
02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
first 30 to 45 days of your sentence
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
what they do is they'll do an assessment
 
02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
um mental health assessment they're
 
02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
going to they're going to look at um
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
your crime if you need to see a laid act
 
02:04:20.549 --> 02:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
they're going to do all these types of
 
02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
Assessments to develop what type of pro
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh a prison plan pretty much that you
 
02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
must follow in order to be eligible for
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
parole so it's going to look different
 
02:04:35.790 --> 02:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
for each person but one of the main
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
requirements that is thematic for
 
02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
everyone is that they have to complete
 
02:04:42.589 --> 02:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
whatever programs the doc or the court
 
02:04:42.599 --> 02:04:43.790 align:start position:0%
whatever programs the doc or the court
has

02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:04:50.030 --> 02:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:04:52.229 --> 02:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands raised I want to
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank the witness for his testimony the
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%

Panetta

02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
Panetta
 
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying in support of the bill I
 
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
am a resident of Nashville New Hampshire
 
02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
um born and raised in Nashville New
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was formally incarcerated I
 
02:05:44.589 --> 02:05:44.599 align:start position:0%
was in prison for 15 years I've been
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
released for the
 
02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
past nine months
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
and and again I'm I'm I'm testifying on
 
02:05:54.189 --> 02:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
my own behalf as a a private citizen for
 
02:05:54.199 --> 02:05:55.549 align:start position:0%
my own behalf as a a private citizen for
HB

02:05:55.549 --> 02:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
HB
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
598 and I've been listening to um a lot
 
02:06:00.069 --> 02:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
of what's been said you know there's a
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
lot of back and forth um this is nothing
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
new you know uh I know Donna saitech was
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh um has been in support of Truth
 
02:06:13.390 --> 02:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
and sentencing for such a long time and
 
02:06:15.149 --> 02:06:15.159 align:start position:0%
as she saids she is the mother of the of
 
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
the bill um but I just feel that you
 
02:06:20.189 --> 02:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
know in the past last three and a half
 
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
four decades a lot has changed and not
 
02:06:28.510 --> 02:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
for the best um you
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
know statistics if you want to look at
 
02:06:32.549 --> 02:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
numbers the population of prison you
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
know back in 83 was you know around 300
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
and since then the prison population in
 
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has risen I think 600% and
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
I think we lead that in the country um
 
02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:46.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem you
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
know we're at what 20 500 roughly
 
02:06:51.950 --> 02:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
inmates in the prison population numbers
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
have been trending down
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
lately um but some of that can be
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
attributed to the epidemic as of the
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
past year as to why those numbers are
 
02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
trending down and the fact of the matter
 
02:07:08.589 --> 02:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
is you know programs are threatened um
 
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
there's cases where you may go to parole
 
02:07:13.390 --> 02:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
and originally when you were sentenced
 
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
you were supposed to do certain programs
 
02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
I can speak personally I was supposed to
 
02:07:20.030 --> 02:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
do a couple different programs that over
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
the years were eliminated so I never
 
02:07:24.549 --> 02:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
even had the opportunity to participate
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
in these programs and it didn't affect
 
02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
me at the end when I was
 
02:07:33.709 --> 02:07:33.719 align:start position:0%
parols um I'm also a person that was uh
 
02:07:37.589 --> 02:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
had filed for two-thirds reduction the
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
65120 bill I was eligible for six years
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
I got two um and I'm super you know
 
02:07:48.750 --> 02:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
grateful that I got anything because in
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
most cases a lot people a lot of people
 
02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
do not get any time any relief no matter
 
02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
you know how much they've done over the
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
years to improve themselves and I know
 
02:07:59.790 --> 02:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
of guys that you know they had they got
 
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
master's degrees and got very little
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
relief if any um also the earn time
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
credit bill it has its flaws you know
 
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
again some of those programs are now in
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
the chopping block with the new budget
 
02:08:13.149 --> 02:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
that the uh Governor is proposing and
 
02:08:15.229 --> 02:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
cutting a lot of the education and and
 
02:08:16.709 --> 02:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
programming and I think that's the worst
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
thing that we could possibly do you know
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has such great potential
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to you know do something
 
02:08:26.549 --> 02:08:26.559 align:start position:0%
different for their inate population
 
02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
given the you know the small number um a
 
02:08:33.030 --> 02:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
lot of the you know uh local schools
 
02:08:34.189 --> 02:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
that you know we could potentially get
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
involved I mean that's a whole another
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
subject but uh I just think
 
02:08:41.629 --> 02:08:41.639 align:start position:0%
motivation um you know incentive is so
 
02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
important and and I'm going to try to
 
02:08:45.629 --> 02:08:45.639 align:start position:0%
make this really quick so the
 
02:08:48.549 --> 02:08:48.559 align:start position:0%
best analogy I could make is you know
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
the way sentencing is now it's kind of
 
02:08:53.310 --> 02:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
like socialism you know and bear with me
 
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
so two people could commit the same
 
02:08:58.830 --> 02:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
crime or be uh sentenced the same amount
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
of time and one works their behind off
 
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
goes above and beyond and will get the
 
02:09:09.669 --> 02:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
same we'll go to parole after you know
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
when they're eligible just as the other
 
02:09:12.750 --> 02:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
person who may not do anything they
 
02:09:14.830 --> 02:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
could lay in their bed for their entire
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
seven years and because they were not a
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
troublemaker these two people will get
 
02:09:21.549 --> 02:09:21.559 align:start position:0%
paroled at the same time and that isn't
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
fair you know and if we're going to make
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
and again I'm using this analogy because
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
you know uh capitalism right that's
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
incentive based and so a change in um
 
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know giving folks an opportunity
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
Behind the Walls to get that incentive
 
02:09:39.390 --> 02:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
to get out would be you know would be
 
02:09:41.549 --> 02:09:41.559 align:start position:0%
huge so some guys that just you know
 
02:09:43.069 --> 02:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
just discouraged as soon as they get in
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
and and never think to uh um to do more
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
than they have to some guys just barely
 
02:09:50.750 --> 02:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
get by and these two two same people
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
could get out at the same
 
02:09:55.549 --> 02:09:55.559 align:start position:0%
time um I'm going to wrap it up and you
 
02:09:57.629 --> 02:09:57.639 align:start position:0%
know if anyone has any questions um more
 
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
them thank you for your testimony
 
02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
representative M you recognize for a
 
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
question just thank you for taking my
 
02:10:09.629 --> 02:10:09.639 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for sharing your
 
02:10:13.709 --> 02:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
story um I'm I'm wondering one of the
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
things we hear a lot about in these
 
02:10:18.030 --> 02:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
cases is the the moment when someone in
 
02:10:20.910 --> 02:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
your situation the the light goes on for
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
them you know they realize that that
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
they have to change and they really sort
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
of start the process of
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
changing how many years elapsed between
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
the time the light went on for you and
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
hearer thank you for your question and I
 
02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
think that's a great question you know
 
02:10:43.709 --> 02:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
for me personally um I would say it
 
02:10:47.069 --> 02:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
wasn't like a aha moment it was a
 
02:10:48.370 --> 02:10:48.380 align:start position:0%
gradual change
 
02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:49.709 align:start position:0%
gradual change
[Music]

02:10:49.709 --> 02:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:10:52.549 --> 02:10:52.559 align:start position:0%
but I would say halfway through my
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
sentence is when I started you know
 
02:10:57.629 --> 02:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
almost by fault getting involved in more
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
programs just to get out of the unit
 
02:11:01.589 --> 02:11:01.599 align:start position:0%
just to break up the monotony um there
 
02:11:03.229 --> 02:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
was one program in particular that
 
02:11:05.709 --> 02:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
really you know I can I can kind of look
 
02:11:09.709 --> 02:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
back at as that as the Catalyst for my
 
02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
change and um you know again it was a
 
02:11:15.149 --> 02:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
gradual thing you know it's breaking old
 
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
habits the same habits that you know L
 
02:11:19.270 --> 02:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
me to
 
02:11:23.189 --> 02:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
prison and um so I would say halfway the
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
halfway mark seven and a half years more
 
02:11:29.310 --> 02:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
or less was when you know I was able to
 
02:11:32.109 --> 02:11:32.119 align:start position:0%
um uh to start making that change and it
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
was gradual and you know it just kind of
 
02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
was like a Snowball Effect and you know
 
02:11:38.910 --> 02:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
I got more uh momentum behind me with
 
02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
the more programs I did the more
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
education I got um and it was just you
 
02:11:48.270 --> 02:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
know again it was it was it was for some
 
02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
might be a single moment but for me I
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
would say that halfway point kind of was
 
02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
like that hump I
 
02:11:55.470 --> 02:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
reached I hope that helped answering
 
02:11:57.629 --> 02:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
your question represent M you're
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
recognized for a follow off question yes
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you and and what was your
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
original sentence my original sentence
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
was uh 18 to 36 years and I was able to
 
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
get two years um suspended through the
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
65120 and I was able to get an
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
additional 10 months um through earn
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
time in if I could speak just about earn
 
02:12:21.790 --> 02:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
time real quick 10 at that point when I
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
was eligible for it was the max you can
 
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
get without having to pay for College
 
02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
college is the only other way at that
 
02:12:29.950 --> 02:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
point that you can max out the 23 months
 
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
since I've been released I know that the
 
02:12:34.350 --> 02:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner um and I believe the
 
02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
legislator have been able to make some
 
02:12:37.950 --> 02:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
changes and add some programs to that
 
02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
but so my that ceiling may have may go
 
02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
up but for the most part and able to get
 
02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
the full benefit of the earn time credit
 
02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
bill you need to pay for college and if
 
02:12:47.790 --> 02:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have the funds then you're not
 
02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:49.069 align:start position:0%
you don't have the funds then you're not
getting

02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
getting
 
02:12:52.589 --> 02:12:52.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further hands raised I
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
want to thank the witness for his
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
testimony witness is
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:13.470 --> 02:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
pery hi my name is Nicole paresi I'm
 
02:13:16.030 --> 02:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
from New York um I represent the New
 
02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department correction of
 
02:13:20.830 --> 02:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
inmates I am a prison wife um I actually
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
do agree with this bill and I hope it
 
02:13:25.709 --> 02:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
does pass um being from on the other
 
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
side from an outsider having a husband
 
02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
that's in the Department of Corrections
 
02:13:33.629 --> 02:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
um who's serving um 25 to life
 
02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
sentence um but a crime that he did not
 
02:13:39.229 --> 02:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
do um my question is to you guys I would
 
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
like to see if someone can answer for me
 
02:13:44.229 --> 02:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
um when serving life without parole for
 
02:13:45.310 --> 02:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
something that we're wrongfully
 
02:13:47.229 --> 02:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
convicted of but also has so much
 
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
evidence that wasn't the person that
 
02:13:50.830 --> 02:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
committed the crime but still got life
 
02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
without parole that has to serve life
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
without parole for something that he
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
didn't do how does the family feel that
 
02:14:00.430 --> 02:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
will not be able to have life with their
 
02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
loved ones outside of prison if you
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't pass this bill I think everybody
 
02:14:08.350 --> 02:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
deserves a second chance also in New
 
02:14:09.870 --> 02:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Corrections they
 
02:14:12.669 --> 02:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
recently just took away their
 
02:14:12.679 --> 02:14:13.990 align:start position:0%
recently just took away their
educational

02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
educational
 
02:14:16.270 --> 02:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
program now they're taking away a lot of
 
02:14:18.510 --> 02:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
programs due to funding
 
02:14:22.549 --> 02:14:22.559 align:start position:0%
also the covid As We Know has got out of
 
02:14:24.910 --> 02:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
control everywhere in prison is even
 
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
worse they can't do anything they're
 
02:14:29.549 --> 02:14:29.559 align:start position:0%
locked up you know they're on lockdown
 
02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
when they love these programs these
 
02:14:32.830 --> 02:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
programs give them hope that if they do
 
02:14:34.510 --> 02:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
these programs they're going to have
 
02:14:37.549 --> 02:14:37.559 align:start position:0%
early release um he just recently put in
 
02:14:40.510 --> 02:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
his good earn time for just finishing a
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
program for educational and it wasn't
 
02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
accepted and I don't think that's fair
 
02:14:48.270 --> 02:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
especially when they need hope
 
02:14:49.549 --> 02:14:49.559 align:start position:0%
especially when they're trying to get
 
02:14:52.510 --> 02:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
out early and they're trying to make a
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
difference and I'm from New York and we
 
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
have the true sentencing law New
 
02:14:58.030 --> 02:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state doesn't have
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
it right now and I do as a prison wife I
 
02:15:04.549 --> 02:15:04.559 align:start position:0%
really hope you guys do pass this bill
 
02:15:06.229 --> 02:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
and not all inmates are dangerous
 
02:15:08.430 --> 02:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
they're not all criminals they make
 
02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
mistakes and they realize what they did
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
and they need to come back into this
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:18.350 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:15:19.870 --> 02:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony seeing No
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:29.669 --> 02:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
excused chair now recognizes
 
02:15:35.229 --> 02:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you for the opportunity uh
 
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair for letting me speak um um
 
02:15:46.549 --> 02:15:46.559 align:start position:0%
Colin uh to support HB 598 and HB
 
02:15:50.189 --> 02:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
138 um I believe as a humans we're not
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
perfect and no one is perfect and people
 
02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
have the right to have a second chance
 
02:15:59.790 --> 02:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
and people who committed crimes and most
 
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the times a lot of times they're not
 
02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
crimes that are they can you know they
 
02:16:07.229 --> 02:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
should be convicted for life sentence I
 
02:16:08.669 --> 02:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
believe people they should have the
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be involved with a
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
programs um they can teach them uh
 
02:16:18.189 --> 02:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
different um maybe um we have so many so
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
many fields so many trades that they
 
02:16:23.310 --> 02:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
need people to be trained we have so
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
many people in in a lot of Trades that
 
02:16:26.629 --> 02:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
they they get and retired and then we
 
02:16:28.910 --> 02:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
need people on the trades and then I
 
02:16:30.629 --> 02:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
believe that a lot of these people they
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
can be trained in this these uh
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
different fields and they can get it
 
02:16:36.830 --> 02:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
integrated to the society if they give
 
02:16:38.669 --> 02:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
we give them the opportunity to be part
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
of our society um that's why I support
 
02:16:44.830 --> 02:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
these two bills because I I truly
 
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
believe that are people Des serve and
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
they should have a second chance um to
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
be better for not just for the soul but
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:01.870 --> 02:17:01.880 align:start position:0%

name is Joseph Ebert it's
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
EBT I am a captain with the New
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police I oversee our
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services Bureau um as
 
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
always I thank the committee very much
 
02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak to you this
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
morning um I'm uh speaking today on
 
02:17:38.509 --> 02:17:38.519 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
138 uh and uh although a great deal has
 
02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
been uh discussed and I I won't
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
reiterate points that have already been
 
02:17:48.030 --> 02:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
made uh there were a few things that I
 
02:17:52.190 --> 02:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
thought be mentioned one of which is uh
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
the possibility that the passage of 138
 
02:17:56.830 --> 02:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
may affect clean
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
negotiations um and having somebody
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
accept responsibility for the crime that
 
02:18:06.190 --> 02:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
they have committed uh if somebody has
 
02:18:08.669 --> 02:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
the ability to uh petition for parole
 
02:18:13.309 --> 02:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
although uh it is clearly not guaranteed
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
that may very well uh weigh upon their
 
02:18:17.309 --> 02:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether or not to take
 
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
resp responsibility um and enter into a
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
plea negotiation so I think that's an
 
02:18:25.469 --> 02:18:25.479 align:start position:0%
ancillary or a an unintended uh perhaps
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
effect on the on the system that the
 
02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
passage of 138 would
 
02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
have um I also wanted to just point out
 
02:18:36.509 --> 02:18:36.519 align:start position:0%
that uh people who re uh receive a life
 
02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
sentence the I'm not aware of anybody
 
02:18:42.030 --> 02:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
ple to a life sentence I'm going to say
 
02:18:44.110 --> 02:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
that that has never happened but uh
 
02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
people who receive a life sentence are
 
02:18:49.230 --> 02:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
people who have chosen to go to trial
 
02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
who have uh in most cases not accepted
 
02:18:54.830 --> 02:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility for that crime uh either
 
02:18:56.870 --> 02:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
because they uh they claim that they uh
 
02:18:59.469 --> 02:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
did not commit it which is uh certainly
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh their right to do so uh but I wanted
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
to point out that the the individuals
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
who are sentenced to a life sentence had
 
02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
a number of mechanisms with which to uh
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%
to not end up in that situation um and
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
then as it
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
uh as uh representative scitec had
 
02:19:19.830 --> 02:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
discussed uh the the purpose of that
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
parole hearing as I understand it is not
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
one to bring forward evident items of
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
evident value uh but there is an appeals
 
02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
process that is in place for individuals
 
02:19:33.070 --> 02:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh who receive a conviction uh and
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
lastly I I would just say that um having
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
worked for over a decade in uh the major
 
02:19:42.349 --> 02:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
crime unit which is primarily the
 
02:19:43.830 --> 02:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
homicide investigation unit for the
 
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire I see the
 
02:19:48.429 --> 02:19:48.439 align:start position:0%
terrible effects that
 
02:19:52.710 --> 02:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
homicides have on everyone involved um
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
and as was mentioned before by a
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
previous speaker the retraumatization of
 
02:20:00.510 --> 02:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
individuals uh family members who have
 
02:20:03.070 --> 02:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
to continually go back uh whether it be
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
for a parole hearing or uh it be for an
 
02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
appeal hearing is tremendous um that's
 
02:20:10.429 --> 02:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
my observation I don't speak on their
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
behalf because um thankfully I've never
 
02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
been in that position but my observation
 
02:20:18.270 --> 02:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
has been is is incred ibly traumatic for
 
02:20:19.710 --> 02:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
those individuals to go back through
 
02:20:22.750 --> 02:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
that process so having said that I I am
 
02:20:24.670 --> 02:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
of course willing to take any questions
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:31.110 --> 02:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
have representative Newman you recognize
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:20:37.630 --> 02:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
you to the witness for his testimony and
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question I may have misheard
 
02:20:43.630 --> 02:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
you or may I may have misunderstood you
 
02:20:46.349 --> 02:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
but I I want to be absolutely sure you
 
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
talked about knowing ever ping to a deal
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
or down ping whatever they call it um
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
that you didn't know of one um are are
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
you making any kind of connection
 
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
between a person's um right not to take
 
02:21:03.429 --> 02:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
a plea if they're innocent even though
 
02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
it puts him in much greater Jeopardy for
 
02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
a much greater
 
02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
penalty no I first of all thank you for
 
02:21:12.510 --> 02:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
the question and uh and again I I want
 
02:21:14.990 --> 02:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure I I I try hard never to
 
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
make a a true true hard fast statement
 
02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
um of fact because there is there are
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
always occasions when uh somebody may
 
02:21:26.190 --> 02:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
enter into a plea agreement for a life
 
02:21:29.790 --> 02:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
sentence um to avoid a uh a death
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
penalty case something like that there's
 
02:21:34.750 --> 02:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
a it's a very rare circumstance but uh
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
having said that representative Newman
 
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
what is so important to emphasize is I
 
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
never want to penal penalize somebody
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
and nor does the uh the division of
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
State Police ever want to penalize
 
02:21:47.950 --> 02:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
somebody for exercising their rights
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
or uh for penalize somebody who is
 
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
innocent of a crime what I what I was
 
02:21:55.469 --> 02:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
saying or what I was trying to convey
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
and I probably didn't do in as clear a
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
fashion as I I could have is uh that an
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
individual who receives a life sentence
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
has been adjudicated through the system
 
02:22:06.270 --> 02:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
they have been found guilty they have
 
02:22:09.150 --> 02:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
had their opportunity to argue uh their
 
02:22:11.550 --> 02:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
facts and circumstances and a judge or
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
Jury has found them uh guilty of that
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
charge what I'm saying is that that
 
02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:18.070 align:start position:0%
charge what I'm saying is that that
individual

02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh had the knowledge of what really
 
02:22:22.270 --> 02:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
happened and they chose not to enter
 
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
into that plea agreement and they may uh
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
be more likely to not enter into a plea
 
02:22:29.630 --> 02:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
agreement and accept responsibility for
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
a crime they committed not that they did
 
02:22:33.309 --> 02:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
not commit for a crime that they
 
02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
committed they may be less likely to
 
02:22:37.950 --> 02:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
enter into a plea agreement to accept
 
02:22:39.630 --> 02:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the a crime they
 
02:22:41.469 --> 02:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
committed if they know that there is a
 
02:22:43.870 --> 02:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
built-in safety valve of of the
 
02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
possibility of Cor in 25 years so I I
 
02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
hope that clears it up but I want to
 
02:22:50.990 --> 02:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
make that crystal clear that I never
 
02:22:54.110 --> 02:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
want somebody to engage in any type of
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
plea uh agreement or ple conversation if
 
02:22:59.150 --> 02:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
they're innocent of a
 
02:23:01.309 --> 02:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
crime thank you very much for that
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
clarification seeing No Hands raised I
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
want to thank the witness for his
 
02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
testimony the witness is excused thank
 
02:23:24.220 --> 02:23:24.230 align:start position:0%

thank you very much I'm sorry U uh I had
 
02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
problems with the mute button um to the
 
02:24:05.349 --> 02:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
representatives thank you for taking the
 
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
time to uh to listen to my suppor of
 
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
598 um I am a criminal defense attorney
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts I've been a criminal
 
02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
defense attorney for some 35 years um
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
I've seen uh many people come back from
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
prison rehabilitated and enter into the
 
02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
system um I am concerned uh with New
 
02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh uh programs being cut for
 
02:24:35.790 --> 02:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
the inmates um and them not being able
 
02:24:39.269 --> 02:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
to obtain credits uh towards their
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
release um I think that um
 
02:24:46.510 --> 02:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh truth and sentencing has been uh
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
around for too long at this point and I
 
02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
believe that um uh that the inmates uh
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
can U engage in programs that can help
 
02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
themselves and I think they need that
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge that if they uh work on
 
02:25:04.830 --> 02:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation that in fact somewhere
 
02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
down the line um that they have the
 
02:25:09.429 --> 02:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be released early thank
 
02:25:11.990 --> 02:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
you very much um and if there's any
 
02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
questions I'm willing to take
 
02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:18.510 align:start position:0%
questions I'm willing to take
them

02:25:18.510 --> 02:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
seeing No Hands raised I want to thank
 
02:25:22.349 --> 02:25:22.359 align:start position:0%
thank the witness for his testimony
 
02:25:22.359 --> 02:25:23.190 align:start position:0%
thank the witness for his testimony
thank

02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%

hand can you hear me didn't
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
comment okay thank you very much my name
 
02:25:47.309 --> 02:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
is Jennifer sergeant and I very much
 
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the committee's taking the
 
02:25:51.630 --> 02:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
time this morning to uh allow me to
 
02:25:53.830 --> 02:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
participate I am the chairman of the New
 
02:25:58.269 --> 02:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Adult Parole Board I have um
 
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
asked Donna scitec to speak on the
 
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
parole board's behalf she did a
 
02:26:06.030 --> 02:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful job there are a couple of
 
02:26:07.790 --> 02:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
things that I would like to
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
clarify uh if I may um the first is
 
02:26:16.030 --> 02:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
regarding incentive versus Community
 
02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:17.710 align:start position:0%
regarding incentive versus Community
safety

02:26:17.710 --> 02:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
incentive as we've heard for residents
 
02:26:23.630 --> 02:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
in the Department of Corrections prison
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
very important
 
02:26:28.389 --> 02:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly uh agree that there
 
02:26:31.950 --> 02:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
should be incentives and there should be
 
02:26:34.110 --> 02:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
programs Community
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
safety is the most important thing that
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
concerns the parole board we have very
 
02:26:46.910 --> 02:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
specific criteria which we must apply
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
why in order to decide if a resident has
 
02:26:54.070 --> 02:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
met the criteria for
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
parole we consider that criteria against
 
02:27:02.309 --> 02:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
What the residents have done what
 
02:27:05.710 --> 02:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
programs they've engaged in but also
 
02:27:09.790 --> 02:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
their conduct in the prison also their
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
um support systems outside their housing
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
plan their ability to be supervised all
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
of the things um besides programming are
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
definitely taken into consideration and
 
02:27:24.750 --> 02:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
it's not just one type of programming or
 
02:27:27.230 --> 02:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
another that we look at I do want to
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
specifically speak to Medical parole
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
medical parole is dictated by Statute
 
02:27:35.469 --> 02:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
and we also have administrative rules
 
02:27:39.630 --> 02:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
that further require us to uh evaluate
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
petitions for medical parole they are
 
02:27:45.630 --> 02:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
few and far between however they do
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
happen and I'm speaking in opposition of
 
02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:27:55.269 --> 02:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
598 because there are many mechanisms
 
02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to repeat what Donna
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
saitech said there are many mechanisms
 
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
including medical parole if necessary in
 
02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
order to allow for a resident who it has
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
certain needs um to be released I want
 
02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
to talk to the practicality of HB 59 98
 
02:28:18.990 --> 02:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
before the
 
02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
board we have found on the parole board
 
02:28:26.710 --> 02:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
and we know that
 
02:28:29.710 --> 02:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
unless residents do
 
02:28:34.510 --> 02:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
programming and they do it at first and
 
02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
significantly with the
 
02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
structure that the doc inside the prison
 
02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
provides that gives them the
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
foundational tools to then go outside to
 
02:28:53.510 --> 02:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
do more treatment more programming and
 
02:28:54.990 --> 02:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:28:59.070 --> 02:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
compliant the fear is
 
02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
that if 598 were to be in effect and if
 
02:29:07.950 --> 02:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
residents could go before the parole
 
02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
board at half of their minimum that they
 
02:29:15.870 --> 02:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
would not have had adequate time given
 
02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
when the Department of Corrections
 
02:29:20.349 --> 02:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
engages them in the programming because
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections does look
 
02:29:27.630 --> 02:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
at their minimum sentences as a trigger
 
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
for timing in which to enroll them in
 
02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:32.030 align:start position:0%
for timing in which to enroll them in
certain

02:29:32.030 --> 02:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
certain
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
Correctional uh programming such as the
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
focus program if they come before the
 
02:29:39.550 --> 02:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
parole board the residents if they come
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
before the parole board at half of their
 
02:29:44.429 --> 02:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
minimum what is going to be the problem
 
02:29:47.550 --> 02:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
is that they programming and their
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
development is often not going to be
 
02:29:54.510 --> 02:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
sufficient enough for us to find them
 
02:29:57.870 --> 02:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
Parable under the criteria that is in
 
02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules what I'm saying
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
is that they will not be sufficiently
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
through all of the things that they need
 
02:30:10.269 --> 02:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
to develop so that parole will be able
 
02:30:14.190 --> 02:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
to find that they are going to be
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
paroled under our very specific criteria
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
in our administrative rules what I'm
 
02:30:24.990 --> 02:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
afraid that this will do is create a
 
02:30:29.269 --> 02:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
false hope for residents who will be
 
02:30:32.269 --> 02:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
seeking parole and will have a parole
 
02:30:36.190 --> 02:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
hearing everybody every resident if this
 
02:30:38.910 --> 02:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
bill passes will be automatically put
 
02:30:41.710 --> 02:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
onto the parole list and it will be
 
02:30:43.830 --> 02:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
noticed publicly as we are required to
 
02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
do by law the parole board will not not
 
02:30:50.349 --> 02:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
have the option of saying No this person
 
02:30:52.510 --> 02:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
isn't ready yet for a hearing or yes
 
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
this person isn't ready for a hearing
 
02:30:57.550 --> 02:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
yet that's not how it works what our
 
02:31:00.190 --> 02:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
office does is look at where they are
 
02:31:04.110 --> 02:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
timing wise in relation to their parole
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility date which is their minimum
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
um which would be half of their minimum
 
02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
if 598 passes and they automatically get
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
scheduled for a parole hearing this
 
02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
would significantly increase the number
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
if it is in fact applied to Residents
 
02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
who are already in the prison it would
 
02:31:25.950 --> 02:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
significantly increase the number of
 
02:31:28.190 --> 02:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
hearings that would have to
 
02:31:32.590 --> 02:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
happen um I'm worried about the fact
 
02:31:35.790 --> 02:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
that we would be seeing people uh seeing
 
02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
residents too early and they would not
 
02:31:41.950 --> 02:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
have fulfilled um the obligations for
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
them to meet the criteria for
 
02:31:47.349 --> 02:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
parole additionally Donna sitech has
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
spoken about the effect on victims uh it
 
02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
would create a situation where I'm
 
02:31:57.790 --> 02:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
afraid more often than not victims would
 
02:32:00.429 --> 02:32:00.439 align:start position:0%
have to prepare for these hearings and
 
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
these hearings would more often than not
 
02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
not result in parole because the
 
02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
residents would not have been able to
 
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
complete enough programming um and have
 
02:32:16.990 --> 02:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
have had structure for long
 
02:32:21.309 --> 02:32:21.319 align:start position:0%
enough uh to make themselves um adequate
 
02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
risks um regarding Community safety
 
02:32:25.880 --> 02:32:27.590 align:start position:0%
risks um regarding Community safety
moreover

02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
moreover
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh the staff
 
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
involved um and the parole board budget
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
is very limited at this time hb2 that we
 
02:32:40.830 --> 02:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
have also proposed and there's been
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
discussion about briefly today is the
 
02:32:47.469 --> 02:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
first step in making the parole office
 
02:32:52.910 --> 02:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
able to handle a lot more um a lot more
 
02:32:57.790 --> 02:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
work adding staff um building up our
 
02:33:02.309 --> 02:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
potential to hear more residents on a
 
02:33:05.550 --> 02:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
more frequent basis the parole board
 
02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
ideally would love to be full-time
 
02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
that's not going to happen yet but we
 
02:33:13.590 --> 02:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
believe in seeing as many residents as
 
02:33:16.870 --> 02:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
possible as often as possible that is
 
02:33:20.510 --> 02:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
the goal right now the Staffing and the
 
02:33:23.790 --> 02:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh resources are not adequate to
 
02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
overload our office with a number with
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
the number of Perle hearings that I fear
 
02:33:35.950 --> 02:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
will happen if 598 passes as a result we
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
will not have the ability to amass
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
adequate information about all of the
 
02:33:43.269 --> 02:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
residents it's very difficult for our
 
02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
staff to gather um a sign significant
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
amount of information from all different
 
02:33:51.389 --> 02:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
uh sources and places in order to
 
02:33:53.309 --> 02:33:53.319 align:start position:0%
prepare the parole packets that the
 
02:33:55.870 --> 02:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
parole uh members
 
02:33:58.389 --> 02:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
use we want to make sure that we're
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
making decisions for the residents and
 
02:34:05.070 --> 02:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
for the community based on the
 
02:34:08.830 --> 02:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
most uh and the best information that we
 
02:34:11.870 --> 02:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
can get about all of the residents um
 
02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
and all of their plans and their
 
02:34:17.630 --> 02:34:17.640 align:start position:0%
accomplishments we are Pro relase that
 
02:34:19.870 --> 02:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
is evident from the fact that we work
 
02:34:23.309 --> 02:34:23.319 align:start position:0%
hard to uh get as much information as we
 
02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
can and work very closely with the do so
 
02:34:28.670 --> 02:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
that we can release people to the
 
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
community safely but 598 is potentially
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
going to create an onslaught that need
 
02:34:40.710 --> 02:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
not happen given the opportunities for
 
02:34:42.830 --> 02:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
earn time credit that are available
 
02:34:44.670 --> 02:34:44.680 align:start position:0%
given the opportunities for medical
 
02:34:48.110 --> 02:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
parole that are available and also um
 
02:34:50.349 --> 02:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
because of the inadequacies that we have
 
02:34:54.269 --> 02:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
currently with staff and office size um
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
we hope to with hb2 get a start on
 
02:35:01.870 --> 02:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
trying to hear
 
02:35:06.750 --> 02:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
more uh more residents more frequently
 
02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
but right now what is asked in
 
02:35:14.030 --> 02:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
598 um is diff difficult to accomplish
 
02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
practically on the ground for our board
 
02:35:19.230 --> 02:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
and I uh thank you for hearing me I will
 
02:35:23.070 --> 02:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:25.309 --> 02:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
have chairman thank you to the witness
 
02:35:29.230 --> 02:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
for taking the question and for the nice
 
02:35:31.309 --> 02:35:31.319 align:start position:0%
presentation several times today I've
 
02:35:33.349 --> 02:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
heard from different Witnesses the
 
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
discussion around
 
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
programs uh for inmates and how
 
02:35:41.469 --> 02:35:41.479 align:start position:0%
completion of these programs is um a
 
02:35:44.030 --> 02:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
requisite for being considered a likely
 
02:35:48.670 --> 02:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
candidate for parole can you offer some
 
02:35:52.190 --> 02:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
clarity on uh the timing that these
 
02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
programs would occur and could these
 
02:35:56.990 --> 02:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
programs begin sooner to then allow the
 
02:36:01.349 --> 02:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
inmate to complete them sooner um
 
02:36:03.429 --> 02:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
and I guess that would be a good start
 
02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
would you mind doing that um I will to
 
02:36:08.429 --> 02:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
the extent that I can and the answer to
 
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
your question is I can't tell you when
 
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
program certain programs are allowed to
 
02:36:15.910 --> 02:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
start as that is the purview of the
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections the
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
programming is run entirely by the
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and the
 
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections is the
 
02:36:26.349 --> 02:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
organization the body the agency that
 
02:36:30.910 --> 02:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
allows and um enrolls the residents in a
 
02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
variety of the programming that we do
 
02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
require such as um the focus program
 
02:36:40.750 --> 02:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment sex offender
 
02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
treatment uh it is really um the timing
 
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
of the programming is set by the
 
02:36:49.510 --> 02:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections for those
 
02:36:53.110 --> 02:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
canical programs on the other hand there
 
02:36:56.590 --> 02:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
are residents who can Avail themselves
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
of programs on what we call the tablet a
 
02:37:03.870 --> 02:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
GTL system that allows them to complete
 
02:37:07.710 --> 02:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
programs that we look favorably upon um
 
02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding those are free
 
02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
and those are available to any Resident
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
with access to a tablet and tablets are
 
02:37:18.990 --> 02:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
readily available so those types of
 
02:37:23.469 --> 02:37:23.479 align:start position:0%
programs residents can be um working on
 
02:37:25.469 --> 02:37:25.479 align:start position:0%
available on the tablet right now there
 
02:37:27.030 --> 02:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
is no
 
02:37:30.150 --> 02:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
Standalone um drug
 
02:37:33.190 --> 02:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation um type program that is
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
used without being used in conjunction
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
with a group type program a
 
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutically based program um the
 
02:37:43.950 --> 02:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
focus program is the therapeutically
 
02:37:46.429 --> 02:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
based program and that has has
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
traditionally and continues to be um a
 
02:37:53.429 --> 02:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
program that is monitored and requires
 
02:37:56.349 --> 02:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
um input and uh design with the
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral health staff um Additionally
 
02:38:01.990 --> 02:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
the sex offender treatment program is
 
02:38:04.429 --> 02:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
similar um in that it it is not a
 
02:38:06.550 --> 02:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
standalone program that be can be done
 
02:38:11.190 --> 02:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
on a tablet or as a selflearning unit um
 
02:38:15.070 --> 02:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
and that is also true at this point for
 
02:38:17.230 --> 02:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
anger man management although I have
 
02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
spoken with the commissioner and will
 
02:38:21.790 --> 02:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
represent that she is trying very hard
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
to add a variety of treatment um
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
oriented programs to the tablet as
 
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
self-learning units it's uh but but to
 
02:38:34.750 --> 02:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
answer your question the timing for
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
programming is out of parole board's
 
02:38:40.269 --> 02:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
hands um it is uh up to the Department
 
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
of Corrections to gauge when and if it
 
02:38:47.349 --> 02:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
allows an uh a resident into um a
 
02:38:47.359 --> 02:38:51.389 align:start position:0%
allows an uh a resident into um a
particular

02:38:51.389 --> 02:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
program thank you chairman thank you
 
02:38:56.990 --> 02:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
Miss Sergeant I thank you for taking my
 
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
question I do have to say um listening
 
02:39:05.510 --> 02:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
to you in to Donna I learned a lot that
 
02:39:07.469 --> 02:39:07.479 align:start position:0%
I just simply I guess I I never even
 
02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
thought that I needed to know these
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
things um but something specific I want
 
02:39:13.070 --> 02:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
to ask that I think that you'd be the
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
best person from all the people that
 
02:39:18.750 --> 02:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
testified so when we have an inmate that
 
02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
is transferred out of
 
02:39:25.269 --> 02:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
state is does that inmate Still Still
 
02:39:27.389 --> 02:39:27.399 align:start position:0%
follow the New
 
02:39:30.150 --> 02:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like the New Hampshire
 
02:39:33.309 --> 02:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
laws as far as you know what has to be
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
met or would it follow that particular
 
02:39:38.550 --> 02:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
State when we have an inmate who is
 
02:39:41.110 --> 02:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
transferred out of state they do still
 
02:39:43.830 --> 02:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
have to abide by the programming that
 
02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
the parole board requires so for
 
02:39:50.269 --> 02:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
instance if someone in the New Hampshire
 
02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
if an inmate in the New Hampshire system
 
02:39:55.389 --> 02:39:55.399 align:start position:0%
has been recommended or required to do
 
02:39:57.950 --> 02:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
sex offender treatment and then is
 
02:40:00.110 --> 02:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
transferred out of state the New
 
02:40:01.950 --> 02:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Corrections
 
02:40:05.469 --> 02:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
through um the sex offender program um
 
02:40:07.230 --> 02:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
and the professionals who work in that
 
02:40:10.030 --> 02:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
program they're usually the ones who
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
will coordinate with that outof state
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
facility to make sure that the
 
02:40:16.190 --> 02:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
programming that they're a able to do
 
02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
out of state meets the criteria of the
 
02:40:20.990 --> 02:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
programming that would be offered in New
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if that inmate had remained in
 
02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:23.830 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if that inmate had remained in
New

02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:25.469 align:start position:0%
New
Hampshire

02:40:25.469 --> 02:40:25.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:40:29.070 --> 02:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
um if the programming in the other state
 
02:40:31.710 --> 02:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
is insufficient oftentimes what will
 
02:40:34.590 --> 02:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
happen is that the uh inmate will be
 
02:40:36.670 --> 02:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
brought back to the New Hampshire State
 
02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
Prison in order to complete the
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
programming that would be required by
 
02:40:44.110 --> 02:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
the Professionals in New Hampshire does
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
that answer your question
 
02:40:49.349 --> 02:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
I believe so thank
 
02:40:52.790 --> 02:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
you representative M you have a
 
02:40:56.389 --> 02:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
question you thank you Mr chairman um I
 
02:40:58.230 --> 02:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if you think that the
 
02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
amount of time served on the part of of
 
02:41:04.910 --> 02:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
an inmate um should be dependent on
 
02:41:08.469 --> 02:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
things that that seem to be outside of
 
02:41:10.910 --> 02:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
the inmates control and and by by that I
 
02:41:14.630 --> 02:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
mean it seems like uh programs uh appear
 
02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
they disappear
 
02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:17.269 align:start position:0%
they disappear
um

02:41:17.269 --> 02:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
expectations uh can change um and it it
 
02:41:25.230 --> 02:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
seems like there's a lot of potential uh
 
02:41:27.230 --> 02:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
for people to fall into the cracks and
 
02:41:30.750 --> 02:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
even to run into a uh you know various
 
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
catch22 situations in the system just
 
02:41:37.670 --> 02:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:41.349 --> 02:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
that well if I understand your question
 
02:41:44.150 --> 02:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
correctly I think what you're asking me
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
is a question question about
 
02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
fairness is that fair to say like
 
02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
whether it
 
02:41:57.150 --> 02:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
is whether it is a good policy or a h a
 
02:42:00.790 --> 02:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
good practice to not
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
consider inmates for parole until they
 
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
have completed certain programming where
 
02:42:11.309 --> 02:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
their ability to get into that
 
02:42:15.070 --> 02:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
programming um may be caused by a delay
 
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
that is not their own I think that's
 
02:42:22.429 --> 02:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
another way of saying it okay um I'm not
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
answer regarding whether it's fair
 
02:42:30.990 --> 02:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
because it we are bound to consider
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
parole eligibility by
 
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
criteria and we also H have to always
 
02:42:42.030 --> 02:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
consider Public Safety as part of that
 
02:42:44.590 --> 02:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
criteria as a major part of that
 
02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:45.910 align:start position:0%
criteria as a major part of that
criteria

02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
02:42:47.630 --> 02:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line
 
02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
becomes whether we believe it's fair or
 
02:42:53.950 --> 02:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
not how long it takes a resident to get
 
02:42:57.510 --> 02:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
into a type of
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
programming we ultimately are not going
 
02:43:03.230 --> 02:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
to make a decision to parole
 
02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
someone if we don't believe that they
 
02:43:08.590 --> 02:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
are not safe in the community and that
 
02:43:12.750 --> 02:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
they are not invested and able to
 
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
maintain their re-entry
 
02:43:19.830 --> 02:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
um followup and after care
 
02:43:22.910 --> 02:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
treatment they have to be prepped and
 
02:43:26.429 --> 02:43:26.439 align:start position:0%
ready in the prison to go out into the
 
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
community where there is less
 
02:43:32.030 --> 02:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
structure in order to carry on with all
 
02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
of the things that the programming in
 
02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
the prison enables them to gain
 
02:43:41.190 --> 02:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
foundationally if they cannot get those
 
02:43:44.110 --> 02:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
things in the prison then they are not
 
02:43:47.150 --> 02:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
safe to be often I'm not saying in every
 
02:43:50.269 --> 02:43:50.279 align:start position:0%
case but they are often just not safe to
 
02:43:53.309 --> 02:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
be in the community that is absolutely
 
02:43:55.309 --> 02:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
why programming in the prison is
 
02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
essential and frankly and I'm speaking
 
02:43:59.389 --> 02:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
for myself
 
02:44:01.750 --> 02:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
now this shouldn't programming in the
 
02:44:04.269 --> 02:44:04.279 align:start position:0%
prison should not be cut it should be
 
02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
encouraged um and the commissioner is
 
02:44:09.230 --> 02:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated to trying to get more
 
02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
programming in um there are issues in
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections uh that
 
02:44:17.070 --> 02:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of because I I don't work
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
for them what I can tell you is when it
 
02:44:23.429 --> 02:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
comes to paroling someone we have to
 
02:44:25.150 --> 02:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
look at whether or not they meet the
 
02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
criteria and whether they've been
 
02:44:31.830 --> 02:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
prepared entered into programming
 
02:44:36.510 --> 02:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
and engaged in self betterment to the
 
02:44:38.750 --> 02:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
extent that they are safe in the
 
02:44:40.349 --> 02:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
community and that they meet the
 
02:44:43.790 --> 02:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
criteria for peole does that make sense
 
02:44:46.710 --> 02:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
if not I'll I'll try again
 
02:44:49.750 --> 02:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
02:44:51.970 --> 02:44:51.980 align:start position:0%
okay you have a further
 
02:44:51.980 --> 02:44:57.950 align:start position:0%
okay you have a further
[Music]

02:44:57.950 --> 02:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
02:45:06.670 --> 02:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
question um could you give me some or
 
02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
the committee some idea of how often you
 
02:45:13.630 --> 02:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
run into a
 
02:45:17.349 --> 02:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
prisoner who has met all of the
 
02:45:20.429 --> 02:45:20.439 align:start position:0%
criteria except the programs that are
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
required but runs into his minimum
 
02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
sentence time uh and the only thing that
 
02:45:28.870 --> 02:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
is preventing that prisoner from being
 
02:45:31.309 --> 02:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
considered for parole is that the
 
02:45:36.830 --> 02:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:39.150 --> 02:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
completed I don't have a definite number
 
02:45:42.550 --> 02:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
for you I can tell you that um because
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
the focus program is about about six
 
02:45:47.950 --> 02:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
months long sex offender treatment can
 
02:45:50.510 --> 02:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
take and it can take more or less time
 
02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
um based on the part the the active
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
participation of the resident and and
 
02:45:56.870 --> 02:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
the investment that the resident makes
 
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
um sex offender treatment the same um
 
02:46:05.269 --> 02:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
other programming the same um many times
 
02:46:08.750 --> 02:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
what happens is if a an inmate is
 
02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
enrolled already in the programming and
 
02:46:14.070 --> 02:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
their hearing is coming up they will do
 
02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
one of two things either they will
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
postpone their hearing until they are
 
02:46:22.590 --> 02:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
close to finishing the program or have
 
02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
finished the program because they know
 
02:46:27.070 --> 02:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
that's if they're enrolled the the
 
02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
parole board is going to require them to
 
02:46:33.230 --> 02:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
complete it um or they will appear
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
before parole and they will ask for a
 
02:46:38.590 --> 02:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
conditional parole par parole me upon
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
the completion of my program um and
 
02:46:43.389 --> 02:46:43.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes the parole board will do that
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it won't but but um we
 
02:46:48.389 --> 02:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
have we've we've done that often um in
 
02:46:51.309 --> 02:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
the year that I have been on the board
 
02:46:53.190 --> 02:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
what we have noticed and this is a
 
02:46:56.830 --> 02:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
product of um I believe in in good part
 
02:46:58.710 --> 02:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
covid but I I cannot speak for the
 
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections is we have
 
02:47:03.870 --> 02:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
noticed that uh the focus program as J
 
02:47:06.510 --> 02:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
Macky mentioned has a very long waiting
 
02:47:10.190 --> 02:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
list um we are currently residents are
 
02:47:12.389 --> 02:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
being brought up to the North Country
 
02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
facility to be doing that as it is not
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
currently running at the conquered
 
02:47:20.790 --> 02:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
facility um but there is a waiting list
 
02:47:24.590 --> 02:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
most uh residents who are coming in are
 
02:47:27.910 --> 02:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
triggering in their initial intake for
 
02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treatment and
 
02:47:33.030 --> 02:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
that requires them to go through
 
02:47:37.269 --> 02:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treatment um
 
02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
there is no Standalone learning unit to
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
go through substance use disorder
 
02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
treatment nor am I convinced um and this
 
02:47:48.070 --> 02:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
is my unprofessional opinion that there
 
02:47:51.710 --> 02:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
is a uh an a learning tablet learning
 
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
unit which substitutes for Asam criteria
 
02:48:00.110 --> 02:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
um addiction uh criteria that would be
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
adequate for treatment so do we do we
 
02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
see people in who would be eligible at
 
02:48:09.550 --> 02:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
their minimum who have not who have been
 
02:48:11.670 --> 02:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
on the focus list or other treatment
 
02:48:13.870 --> 02:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
lists who have not enrolled yes we've
 
02:48:16.670 --> 02:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
seen an increase that in the last year
 
02:48:19.070 --> 02:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
but that may be because of limited
 
02:48:21.550 --> 02:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
movement in the prison uh due to covid
 
02:48:24.309 --> 02:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
it may be um
 
02:48:26.910 --> 02:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
protections uh it may be availability of
 
02:48:29.510 --> 02:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
beds that is something that I would
 
02:48:32.750 --> 02:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
suggest the commissioner um speak to and
 
02:48:35.110 --> 02:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
not myself but yes we we have people on
 
02:48:36.910 --> 02:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
the waiting list that we will not parole
 
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
because they have not yet been able to
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:46.150 align:start position:0%
 
treatment

02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes you may thank you very
 
02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
much um you mentioned tablets and
 
02:48:56.349 --> 02:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
tablets are readily available yes are
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
those tablets available from uh the
 
02:49:03.309 --> 02:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
government and are they free or do they
 
02:49:04.830 --> 02:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
have to have someone buy them those
 
02:49:07.150 --> 02:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
tablets I don't know the answer to that
 
02:49:08.670 --> 02:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
that is a Department of
 
02:49:11.150 --> 02:49:11.160 align:start position:0%

signing in an
 
02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
opposition on House Bill

04:30:41.710 --> 04:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 205 a bill relative to
 
04:30:45.070 --> 04:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
incarceration under a suspended sentence
 
04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is identical to last year's
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
HB 1611 although I will be proposing a
 
04:30:53.910 --> 04:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
minor Amendment which you should have
 
04:30:56.229 --> 04:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
already received via
 
04:30:59.670 --> 04:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
email last year's HB 1611 was voted
 
04:31:01.830 --> 04:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass in this committee by a
 
04:31:04.229 --> 04:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
vote of 20 to zero and passed in the
 
04:31:06.510 --> 04:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
house by a Voice vote
 
04:31:08.149 --> 04:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was one of the many
 
04:31:09.790 --> 04:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
bills that were placed on the table in
 
04:31:12.910 --> 04:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:16.149 --> 04:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
covid-19 hb25 makes a small but
 
04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
important fix to a statute that allows
 
04:31:21.670 --> 04:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
residents serving as a sentence in state
 
04:31:24.030 --> 04:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
prison to petition for suspension of
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
their sentence after serving two-thirds
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
of their time the amount of time served
 
04:31:32.750 --> 04:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
does not change what does change is that
 
04:31:35.149 --> 04:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
instead of waiting to reach the 2third
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
mark to be able to petition residents
 
04:31:40.269 --> 04:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
will now be able to petition earlier
 
04:31:42.510 --> 04:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
giving them the needed time to receive a
 
04:31:46.030 --> 04:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
court date wait for that court date and
 
04:31:48.149 --> 04:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
to enter and hopefully complete any
 
04:31:50.590 --> 04:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
needed rehabilitative programming
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:55.630 --> 04:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
eligibility currently residents must
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
wait till they have served two-thirds of
 
04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
their sentence to petition and if it is
 
04:32:01.630 --> 04:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
eventually approved their release would
 
04:32:04.910 --> 04:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
occur well after the 23ds time you will
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
see that the bill is introduced calls
 
04:32:09.870 --> 04:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
for an 18-month time frame and the
 
04:32:09.880 --> 04:32:11.389 align:start position:0%
for an 18-month time frame and the
amendment

04:32:11.389 --> 04:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:32:13.950 --> 04:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
reduces and the amendment reduces that
 
04:32:16.030 --> 04:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
time frame to 12 months to address
 
04:32:18.070 --> 04:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
concerns from the Department of
 
04:32:20.149 --> 04:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
Corrections I believe that commissioner
 
04:32:21.790 --> 04:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
Hanks or representative from the
 
04:32:23.790 --> 04:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
department will be testifying in support
 
04:32:26.189 --> 04:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
of that shorter time
 
04:32:28.630 --> 04:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
frame I want to take just a moment to
 
04:32:31.469 --> 04:32:31.479 align:start position:0%
give credit for this bill to the RCC the
 
04:32:34.070 --> 04:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
resident Communications committee a
 
04:32:35.750 --> 04:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
group of residents at the conquered
 
04:32:37.950 --> 04:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
prison for men whom I met with some two
 
04:32:40.950 --> 04:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
years ago these men many serving very
 
04:32:43.109 --> 04:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
long sentences work with their fellow
 
04:32:45.189 --> 04:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
inmates to support a positive adjustment
 
04:32:47.910 --> 04:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
to prison life and work with corrections
 
04:32:49.990 --> 04:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
administrators to advocate for
 
04:32:53.070 --> 04:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
constructive policy changes it was this
 
04:32:54.790 --> 04:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
very impressive group of men that
 
04:32:57.149 --> 04:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
identified this frustrating glitch and
 
04:32:59.469 --> 04:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
offered what I believe is a very helpful
 
04:33:01.309 --> 04:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
and very reasonable
 
04:33:03.510 --> 04:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
fix thank you and I would be glad to

thank you representative seeing No Hands
 
04:33:15.789 --> 04:33:15.799 align:start position:0%

please raise your hands at this time uh
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
as a discretion of the chair we can

04:33:34.359 --> 04:33:42.670 align:start position:0%
 
minute

04:33:42.670 --> 04:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:42.680 --> 04:33:44.789 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:33:44.789 --> 04:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:33:44.799 --> 04:33:47.029 align:start position:0%
I
recogniz

04:33:47.029 --> 04:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
recogniz
 
04:33:49.551 --> 04:33:49.561 align:start position:0%
may good afternoon I would like to thank
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
the chairman as well as the committee
 
04:33:52.990 --> 04:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak uh my name is
 
04:33:54.910 --> 04:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
Josiah Mayo I'm a lifelong resident of
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and constituent uh I am
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
supportive he Bill
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
205 I believe passing this bill gives
 
04:34:02.990 --> 04:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
residents an opportunity to prepare for
 
04:34:04.910 --> 04:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
their eventual release this is not a Go
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
Home free passed as we know a judge
 
04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
still has to make a decision and the
 
04:34:11.189 --> 04:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
parole board still has to Grant parole
 
04:34:13.470 --> 04:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh we we have heard testimony today that
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
states programming is contingent upon a
 
04:34:17.949 --> 04:34:17.959 align:start position:0%
resident minimum parole date part of
 
04:34:20.470 --> 04:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
parole release criteria is based upon
 
04:34:23.470 --> 04:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
residents completing programming um I
 
04:34:25.269 --> 04:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
would like to clarify what that means an
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
18-year-old resident who has been sent a
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
three and a half years sentence would be
 
04:34:30.510 --> 04:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
forced to coexist with other residents
 
04:34:31.869 --> 04:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
who have been neglected or further
 
04:34:34.230 --> 04:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
criminalized due to the lack of timely
 
04:34:36.670 --> 04:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
programming and we reabilitation uh in
 
04:34:38.349 --> 04:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
one of the most extreme and deprived
 
04:34:40.670 --> 04:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
environments um this bill in fact helps
 
04:34:42.390 --> 04:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
residents if eligible to access
 
04:34:44.310 --> 04:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
programming sooner which I believe is
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
Paramount to Rehabilitation successful
 
04:34:49.269 --> 04:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
reentry as well as Public Safety um I
 
04:34:51.230 --> 04:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
support this bill for those reasons that
 
04:34:53.429 --> 04:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
I have stated um my hope is that this
 
04:34:55.310 --> 04:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
committee does as well take any
 
04:35:00.869 --> 04:35:00.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:03.949 --> 04:35:03.959 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony seeing
 
04:35:07.869 --> 04:35:07.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:12.830 --> 04:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:15.470 --> 04:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
Mackey Mr reminder your testimony is is
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
limited to one minute Mr chairman was
 
04:35:20.349 --> 04:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
that Matthew or
 
04:35:27.109 --> 04:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:28.990 --> 04:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
chairman good afternoon chairman can
 
04:35:33.390 --> 04:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
everyone hear me yes great um thank you
 
04:35:35.789 --> 04:35:35.799 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to testify on this bill
 
04:35:37.150 --> 04:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
um my name is Jay Mackey I'm the
 
04:35:38.390 --> 04:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
administrator of classifications and
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
client records for the New Hampshire
 
04:35:42.629 --> 04:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
Department Corrections as we are
 
04:35:45.670 --> 04:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
originally were opposed to this bill
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
with the 18-month time frame the
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
12-month amendment is a a more suitable
 
04:35:52.310 --> 04:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
time frame that we have seen and we do
 
04:35:55.629 --> 04:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
support that Amendment um as discussed
 
04:35:57.949 --> 04:35:57.959 align:start position:0%
earlier today with the house bill 598
 
04:35:59.551 --> 04:35:59.561 align:start position:0%
some of the issues arising is about
 
04:36:02.551 --> 04:36:02.561 align:start position:0%
getting into programs in a in a in a
 
04:36:04.949 --> 04:36:04.959 align:start position:0%
proper time frame so when we do Supply
 
04:36:06.429 --> 04:36:06.439 align:start position:0%
the court with all the needed
 
04:36:09.910 --> 04:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
information we um sometimes they do not
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
have the ability to get into the
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
programs because based on their minimum
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
parole date they were never able to get
 
04:36:17.310 --> 04:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
into the programs because getting their
 
04:36:20.429 --> 04:36:20.439 align:start position:0%
two-thirds is not something that is
 
04:36:22.670 --> 04:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
always granted so we can't rely on that
 
04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
to get them into those programs we
 
04:36:25.709 --> 04:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
usually get them into those programs
 
04:36:28.070 --> 04:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
around two years to their minimum um so
 
04:36:29.349 --> 04:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
that was an issue that was raised but
 
04:36:30.949 --> 04:36:30.959 align:start position:0%
with the 12month time frame we do
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I can take any
 
04:36:34.080 --> 04:36:37.789 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I can take any
questions

04:36:37.789 --> 04:36:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:36:40.150 --> 04:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative TR you recognize for our
 
04:36:42.390 --> 04:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh and thank
 
04:36:46.750 --> 04:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:50.429 --> 04:36:50.439 align:start position:0%
um in your opinion what what makes the
 
04:36:53.349 --> 04:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
12 month acceptable to you but the 18
 
04:36:53.359 --> 04:36:55.670 align:start position:0%
12 month acceptable to you but the 18
month

04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
month
 
04:37:00.070 --> 04:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
not month so this bill produces allows
 
04:37:01.789 --> 04:37:01.799 align:start position:0%
someone that is sentenced to a six-year
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
minimum their two-thirds would be after
 
04:37:06.189 --> 04:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
four years 18 18 months is about two and
 
04:37:08.590 --> 04:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
a half years when they can apply they've
 
04:37:10.109 --> 04:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
only served two and a half years of a
 
04:37:12.510 --> 04:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
six-year minimum there's not really
 
04:37:14.949 --> 04:37:14.959 align:start position:0%
enough body of work that we would be
 
04:37:17.429 --> 04:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
able to supply for the court for them to
 
04:37:18.789 --> 04:37:18.799 align:start position:0%
make a good decision on whether or not
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
this person should be granted two thirds
 
04:37:23.310 --> 04:37:23.320 align:start position:0%
it also an issue that arises is if that
 
04:37:25.390 --> 04:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
person is granted their two-thirds
 
04:37:27.910 --> 04:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
around 18 months to their minimum what
 
04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
is the what happens when they start uh
 
04:37:32.269 --> 04:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
if they start committing major
 
04:37:34.470 --> 04:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
disciplinary violations at the prison
 
04:37:36.269 --> 04:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
most likely that falls on us to contact
 
04:37:38.470 --> 04:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
the County Attorney um to see if they
 
04:37:39.830 --> 04:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
would like the motion to impose the
 
04:37:42.150 --> 04:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
suspended portion of the sentence um we
 
04:37:44.390 --> 04:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
just say 18 months is too much of a time
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
frame where they don't have enough
 
04:37:49.070 --> 04:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
programming to be completed that would
 
04:37:51.349 --> 04:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
allow them to be eligible for parole and
 
04:37:54.070 --> 04:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
even if the court does grant their
 
04:37:56.269 --> 04:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
two-thirds they may not be able to be
 
04:37:57.510 --> 04:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
released on parole because they have not
 
04:37:59.629 --> 04:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
completed that programming as it
 
04:38:03.750 --> 04:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
is um did I answer your question yes
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:09.070 --> 04:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands raised the
 
04:38:13.551 --> 04:38:13.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
Joseph thank you chair and members of
 
04:38:20.520 --> 04:38:21.189 align:start position:0%
Joseph thank you chair and members of
this

04:38:21.189 --> 04:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:38:23.830 --> 04:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
committee um my name is Joseph laskas I
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
will be representing the ACLU of New
 
04:38:29.070 --> 04:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and myself in full support of
 
04:38:32.269 --> 04:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
this legislation uh HP 205 and I hope
 
04:38:33.629 --> 04:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
that this committee votes ought to pass
 
04:38:35.429 --> 04:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
on it as well
 
04:38:38.670 --> 04:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
um I myself have utilized the suspended
 
04:38:41.830 --> 04:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
sentence um system uh when I was
 
04:38:44.510 --> 04:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated uh I I've gone through it
 
04:38:47.551 --> 04:38:47.561 align:start position:0%
um and a successful re-entry after
 
04:38:50.029 --> 04:38:50.039 align:start position:0%
incarceration requires preparation um
 
04:38:52.750 --> 04:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
hands down a critical step in advancing
 
04:38:54.750 --> 04:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
Public Safety is reducing recidivism by
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
making sure that people successfully
 
04:38:58.510 --> 04:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
re-enter into their communities after
 
04:39:00.830 --> 04:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
incarceration and re-entry posts a host
 
04:39:02.230 --> 04:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
of challenges for incarcerated
 
04:39:03.789 --> 04:39:03.799 align:start position:0%
individuals particularly for people who
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
have been in prison for years years or
 
04:39:07.230 --> 04:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
even decades such as like you know
 
04:39:09.629 --> 04:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
culture shock uh identifying housing and
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
employment state identification needs
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
that need to be renewed um just to name
 
04:39:15.670 --> 04:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
a few of the
 
04:39:18.990 --> 04:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
challenges so it it boils down to that a
 
04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
successful re-entry that requires um
 
04:39:23.830 --> 04:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
time and HB 205 doesn't lessen
 
04:39:25.510 --> 04:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
accountability instead it promotes
 
04:39:27.670 --> 04:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility it incentivizes the
 
04:39:29.150 --> 04:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
decision to make a commitment to a
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
positive lifestyle change and re-entry
 
04:39:32.709 --> 04:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
and it happens by promoting
 
04:39:35.070 --> 04:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility by causing residents to
 
04:39:36.670 --> 04:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
start to develop the necessary
 
04:39:38.510 --> 04:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
forethought and judgment skills to
 
04:39:40.628 --> 04:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
manage their own life and plan for their
 
04:39:43.070 --> 04:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
future as well as incentivizing them to
 
04:39:45.750 --> 04:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
commit to making a lifestyle change
 
04:39:47.470 --> 04:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
because just because you are granted a
 
04:39:49.708 --> 04:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
suspended sentence until you reach your

Hampshire Association criminal defense
 
04:40:38.628 --> 04:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
lawyers and I won't repeat um I agree we
 
04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
we are in favor of this bill and I agree
 
04:40:42.788 --> 04:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
with everything that's been said before
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
as a lawyer who regularly does these
 
04:40:48.150 --> 04:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
bills uh I mean does these motions I I
 
04:40:49.708 --> 04:40:49.718 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add a couple of things
 
04:40:52.948 --> 04:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
that also add on to the time I I agree
 
04:40:55.310 --> 04:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh in in terms of getting people into
 
04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
programming um once you file this motion
 
04:40:59.948 --> 04:40:59.958 align:start position:0%
and some very times I've filed it the
 
04:41:02.230 --> 04:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
day it's been allowed so we tried to get
 
04:41:04.270 --> 04:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
them filed as soon as possible then the
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
other has 30 days to respond so now
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
everything comes to a grinding halt for
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
the response and then there's something
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
called a synopsis that the Department of
 
04:41:15.230 --> 04:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
Corrections wres which is basically a
 
04:41:17.628 --> 04:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
summary of the inmate that goes to the
 
04:41:20.590 --> 04:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
judge that takes time too and it can't
 
04:41:22.750 --> 04:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
be done ahead of time so there's these
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
things like the reply from the
 
04:41:27.788 --> 04:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
prosecution and the synopsis that hold
 
04:41:29.708 --> 04:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
things up so it's not you just file the
 
04:41:32.230 --> 04:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
motion and then the judge decides many
 
04:41:34.270 --> 04:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
times it can take four or five months
 
04:41:38.270 --> 04:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
after someone's eligible before they um
 
04:41:40.110 --> 04:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
actually get their day in court or get a
 
04:41:43.030 --> 04:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
ruling and I'll limit my uh testimony at
 
04:41:43.040 --> 04:41:46.830 align:start position:0%
ruling and I'll limit my uh testimony at
that

04:41:46.830 --> 04:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:49.830 --> 04:41:49.840 align:start position:0%

amend my
 
04:42:38.470 --> 04:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
sentence and I fully understand that you
 
04:42:42.510 --> 04:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
know no one is ever able to fully uh
 
04:42:47.190 --> 04:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
realized the full power of this bill of
 
04:42:50.190 --> 04:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
65120 because you're not eligible until
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
you've reached two-thirds of your
 
04:42:53.868 --> 04:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
sentence so right off the rip you're
 
04:42:57.670 --> 04:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're not able
 
04:43:01.110 --> 04:43:01.120 align:start position:0%

sorry so I'm full of support giving a
 
04:43:06.470 --> 04:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
year out gives plenty of time and
 
04:43:07.990 --> 04:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
preparation I
 
04:43:10.430 --> 04:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
personally it took me a year before I
 
04:43:13.190 --> 04:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
actually filed past my two3 point um
 
04:43:14.550 --> 04:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
because I was trying to get all my ducks
 
04:43:16.510 --> 04:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
in a row and I was also trying to go
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
through the dolc to get uh the the um uh
 
04:43:22.150 --> 04:43:22.160 align:start position:0%

04:43:33.230 --> 04:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh time granted me two years but again I

just want to say that uh support it I
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%

04:45:16.400 --> 04:45:19.430 align:start position:0%
to be recognized to reconsider House
Bill

04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:21.470 --> 04:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
238 true
 
04:45:23.628 --> 04:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
second that motion for reconsideration
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
has been
 
04:45:27.390 --> 04:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
seconded wish to speak to your
 
04:45:27.400 --> 04:45:30.868 align:start position:0%
seconded wish to speak to your
motion

04:45:30.868 --> 04:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:34.350 --> 04:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
no before we put that question forward
 
04:45:37.230 --> 04:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
just address a few a few
 
04:45:40.948 --> 04:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
issues move this along quickly first any
 
04:45:42.510 --> 04:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
member wishes to object to any ruling of
 
04:45:43.868 --> 04:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
the chair of
 
04:45:46.070 --> 04:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
procedure is it's appropriate for that
 
04:45:48.350 --> 04:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
me to raise a point of order especially
 
04:45:50.550 --> 04:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
if there's any question on whether the
 
04:45:52.510 --> 04:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
parliamentary procedures being
 
04:45:52.520 --> 04:45:54.590 align:start position:0%
parliamentary procedures being
follow

04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:45:57.070 --> 04:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
now it is difficult when multiple
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
members once whether they're in the room
 
04:46:03.628 --> 04:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
or participating remotely especially
 
04:46:05.390 --> 04:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
what makes it difficult is
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
multiple voices are coming through the
 
04:46:09.310 --> 04:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
same microphone or speaker at the same
 
04:46:13.270 --> 04:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
time so and it was apparently a point of
 
04:46:15.230 --> 04:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
order was raised by a member in this
 
04:46:17.628 --> 04:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
room that I could not even hear that's
 
04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
how loud it was so I would ask
 
04:46:23.070 --> 04:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
that if there is any questions of the
 
04:46:26.070 --> 04:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
rules that we try to conduct ourselves
 
04:46:27.868 --> 04:46:27.878 align:start position:0%
in Accords with the Parliamentary rules
 
04:46:29.310 --> 04:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
simply if a rul is not being followed
 
04:46:31.470 --> 04:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
does not mean we violate or fail to
 
04:46:33.830 --> 04:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
follow additional rules now when it
 
04:46:35.670 --> 04:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
matters is put the question the question
 
04:46:36.708 --> 04:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
is put
 
04:46:39.390 --> 04:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
forward we that means we are now in the
 
04:46:42.430 --> 04:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
voting mod if a member's not in their
 
04:46:45.110 --> 04:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
seat at the time the question is
 
04:46:48.830 --> 04:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
put that member is not allowed to then
 
04:46:50.350 --> 04:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
take their seat if they're not already
 
04:46:52.830 --> 04:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
in the rule also prevents that member
 
04:46:55.628 --> 04:46:55.638 align:start position:0%
from leaving the seat while we're in the
 
04:46:59.430 --> 04:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
voting so I understand that if your
 
04:47:01.430 --> 04:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
video cameras are on or
 
04:47:04.430 --> 04:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
off uh if you're off I have no idea if
 
04:47:06.750 --> 04:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
someone missing but if the camera's on I
 
04:47:08.430 --> 04:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
see the chair or if the person's
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
physically present in the room and when
 
04:47:12.788 --> 04:47:12.798 align:start position:0%
the question is put if you're not in
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
your chair in this room you are now not
 
04:47:18.150 --> 04:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to take take your seat and
 
04:47:20.150 --> 04:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's house Ru 107 if anyone is
 
04:47:23.430 --> 04:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
interested in referring
 
04:47:23.440 --> 04:47:26.110 align:start position:0%
interested in referring
to

04:47:26.110 --> 04:47:26.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:47:29.590 --> 04:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
so in respect to the the motion to
 
04:47:31.590 --> 04:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
pertain when there was a number not in
 
04:47:34.510 --> 04:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
their seat it was it was my
 
04:47:35.628 --> 04:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
understanding of ruling because that
 
04:47:37.150 --> 04:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
member was not in their seat when the
 
04:47:39.430 --> 04:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
question was put that member would not
 
04:47:41.948 --> 04:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
be permitted to take their
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
seat so when the role was called it
 
04:47:48.948 --> 04:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
apparently that member's name was not
 
04:47:51.430 --> 04:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
called which it should have been called
 
04:47:52.990 --> 04:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
so for a housekeeping matter to make
 
04:47:55.990 --> 04:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
sure we're doing our best we can to
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
follow follow the Parliamentary best we
 
04:48:00.430 --> 04:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
can we're gonna I hope that this
 
04:48:02.470 --> 04:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
reconsideration is allowed so we can
 
04:48:05.030 --> 04:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
revote on on the
 
04:48:07.230 --> 04:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
question I would just ask going forward
 
04:48:09.868 --> 04:48:09.878 align:start position:0%
if there is any questions of the chair
 
04:48:13.750 --> 04:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
that we try to do our best
 
04:48:16.510 --> 04:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
to keep it calm because I think there a
 
04:48:18.910 --> 04:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
lot of things were missed during the day
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
with that being
 
04:48:22.628 --> 04:48:22.638 align:start position:0%

bill uh we
 
04:51:59.628 --> 04:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
can to tell you when that will happen I
 
04:52:02.110 --> 04:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
I couldn't even
 
04:52:05.310 --> 04:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
guess but I think that
 
04:52:07.708 --> 04:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
that would be help of the committee I
 
04:52:10.470 --> 04:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
just I I think that if you're G to
 
04:52:15.030 --> 04:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
retain a bill that you would intend to
 
04:52:17.708 --> 04:52:17.718 align:start position:0%
hold hearings on it in the

04:52:22.868 --> 04:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
this I'm not sure what the summer time

bring as well as the fall I don't want
 
04:52:25.390 --> 04:52:25.400 align:start position:0%

04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%

04:53:37.840 --> 04:53:44.190 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I make a motion
to

04:53:44.190 --> 04:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:57.190 --> 04:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:00.270 --> 04:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
second Yes actually
 
04:54:03.548 --> 04:54:03.558 align:start position:0%
um we heard a lot of testimony today
 
04:54:07.830 --> 04:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
obviously um what I'm hearing a lot of
 
04:54:11.788 --> 04:54:11.798 align:start position:0%
is the person that is that is in jail
 
04:54:14.910 --> 04:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
and or medical expenses um and it's it
 
04:54:16.670 --> 04:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
actually very sad to me that we're
 
04:54:19.670 --> 04:54:19.680 align:start position:0%

nobody talking
 
04:54:24.230 --> 04:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
about the victim or the family of the
 
04:54:26.350 --> 04:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
reason why the person is in prison and I
 
04:54:29.590 --> 04:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
think that that should be taken way more
 
04:54:30.990 --> 04:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
into consideration than it was
 
04:54:34.548 --> 04:54:34.558 align:start position:0%

04:54:37.910 --> 04:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you represent

I have an important work
call

04:54:55.150 --> 04:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
call
 
04:54:59.030 --> 04:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
problematic I support the concept of
 
04:55:02.350 --> 04:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
this despite struggling with the impact
 
04:55:04.830 --> 04:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
on victims and fact that people do Very
 
04:55:08.110 --> 04:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
Bad Things um some people who do very
 
04:55:10.510 --> 04:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
bad things should never be let out
 
04:55:14.030 --> 04:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
of uh that said testimony today uh from
 
04:55:16.510 --> 04:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
a number of people made me question my
 
04:55:19.830 --> 04:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
decision to co-sponsor this B so if I'm
 
04:55:27.190 --> 04:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:30.910 --> 04:55:30.920 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair um I will not be
 
04:55:36.750 --> 04:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
voting for itl I think that this is a
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
good bill um in 25 years uh people have
 
04:55:45.190 --> 04:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to rethink of what about
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
what they've done to mature uh we know
 
04:55:53.948 --> 04:55:53.958 align:start position:0%
that the aging process uh changes uh uh
 
04:55:57.510 --> 04:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
people's hormone levels and I think that
 
04:56:01.868 --> 04:56:01.878 align:start position:0%
after 25 years uh if a person is still
 
04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh behaving well
 
04:56:06.788 --> 04:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
then they should have an opportunity to
 
04:56:10.350 --> 04:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
have a pero Paro uh
 
04:56:16.230 --> 04:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:19.948 --> 04:56:19.958 align:start position:0%

Newman thank you Mr chair
taking

04:56:27.270 --> 04:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
taking
 
04:56:31.190 --> 04:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um I also will
 
04:56:33.868 --> 04:56:33.878 align:start position:0%
be voting for this bill because I I also
 
04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
believe that after 25 years and based on
 
04:56:38.110 --> 04:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard from the parole
 
04:56:41.070 --> 04:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
people today that they take into
 
04:56:45.310 --> 04:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
consideration uh the uh possibility of
 
04:56:48.030 --> 04:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
the dangerousness of the person and how
 
04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
they've reacted over those 25 years and
 
04:56:53.150 --> 04:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
I think that if it's one of those people
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
that has not rehabilitated at all and is
 
04:56:58.230 --> 04:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
truly a dangerous person they won't get
 
04:56:59.670 --> 04:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
paroled but I think there's a
 
04:57:02.070 --> 04:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
significant number of prisoners that may
 
04:57:03.628 --> 04:57:03.638 align:start position:0%
have rehabilitated as as a matter of
 
04:57:05.788 --> 04:57:05.798 align:start position:0%
fact I got a letter from one of them
 
04:57:07.628 --> 04:57:07.638 align:start position:0%
that where there were multiple uh
 
04:57:10.910 --> 04:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
degrees that were earned and multiple
 
04:57:13.150 --> 04:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
ways that they had helped um other
 
04:57:15.030 --> 04:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
prisoners to be
 
04:57:17.070 --> 04:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated and I think that they
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
should at least have the the
 
04:57:22.510 --> 04:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
um ability to have a hearing out of Paro
 
04:57:24.788 --> 04:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting for this Bill thank
 
04:57:28.150 --> 04:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:35.708 --> 04:57:35.718 align:start position:0%
Balden thank you Mr chairman um I'm
 
04:57:38.830 --> 04:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
going to be opposing the itl as well um
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
I know that the state constitution
 
04:57:42.548 --> 04:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
dictates that punishments should be
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
designed to reform and not to punish um
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I believe that if we have any
 
04:57:53.670 --> 04:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
confidence in our prison system at all
 
04:57:54.910 --> 04:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
we should have confidence that it's
 
04:57:57.310 --> 04:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
possible for anyone to be reformed uh
 
04:57:59.590 --> 04:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
during their stay so for that reason I'm
 
04:58:02.110 --> 04:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
going to oppose the itl thank
 
04:58:02.120 --> 04:58:06.030 align:start position:0%
going to oppose the itl thank

representative Hopper thank you Mr chair
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
um I think institution was written there
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
were certain crimes that people did
 
04:58:17.830 --> 04:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
where they executed them after they did
 
04:58:19.990 --> 04:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
the crimes after their trial so there
 
04:58:22.150 --> 04:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
was no need they were not reformable
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:32.110 --> 04:58:32.120 align:start position:0%

05:03:34.190 --> 05:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
representing Auburn Chester in Sandown
 
05:03:38.590 --> 05:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a retired army lieutenant colonel
 
05:03:43.548 --> 05:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
uh since 911 uh I deployed out of the U
 
05:03:45.310 --> 05:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
Army National Guard and the Army
 
05:03:48.270 --> 05:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
Reserves on on two separate
 
05:03:51.830 --> 05:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
deployments and what I what I think when
 
05:03:56.110 --> 05:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
I see this bill is um the the um
 
05:03:59.868 --> 05:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
concerns I had when I was in Afghanistan
 
05:04:03.150 --> 05:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
and we were reading in Intel reports
 
05:04:04.708 --> 05:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
saying that there were domestic
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
terrorism plots that were targeting the
 
05:04:11.628 --> 05:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
families of deployed soldiers back home
 
05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
and the way I think my compatriots and I
 
05:04:19.270 --> 05:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
thought about that was that um we we
 
05:04:21.390 --> 05:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
knew what we were accepting we knew what
 
05:04:23.230 --> 05:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
risks we were accepting and we were
 
05:04:26.470 --> 05:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
there as a team trained equipped and all
 
05:04:30.948 --> 05:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
of that but uh if our fortunately this
 
05:04:33.310 --> 05:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
domestic terrorism
 
05:04:37.750 --> 05:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
um didn't occur that I know of but I
 
05:04:41.868 --> 05:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
would almost rather have this apply to
 
05:04:46.070 --> 05:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
the member of a military Armed Forces uh
 
05:04:49.990 --> 05:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
family more so because I the the threat
 
05:04:52.670 --> 05:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
of domestic terrorism striking at a
 
05:04:55.390 --> 05:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
soldier's family while they're deployed
 
05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
is uh a much more harmful thing to U
 
05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
society and our ability to U defend the
 
05:05:06.350 --> 05:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
nation uh I I'm I'm not opposed to
 
05:05:10.270 --> 05:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
having soldiers also protected by this
 
05:05:12.750 --> 05:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
but my bigger concern would be
 
05:05:16.150 --> 05:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
protecting families because uh that that
 
05:05:19.350 --> 05:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
that can under undermine morale far more
 
05:05:21.230 --> 05:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
than having one of your F fellow
 
05:05:26.910 --> 05:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
soldiers um be U struck so that that's
 
05:05:28.788 --> 05:05:28.798 align:start position:0%

things that we do is we we take a look
 
05:06:42.270 --> 05:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
at all the bills coming before the
 
05:06:44.948 --> 05:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
Senate uh and house and we pick out the
 
05:06:47.070 --> 05:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
ones that we think have a better impact
 
05:06:48.990 --> 05:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
and then we discuss those bills and we
 
05:06:50.590 --> 05:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
come up with a position and then they
 
05:06:52.910 --> 05:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
send me to testify to you and tell you
 
05:06:55.150 --> 05:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
what it is that we think and so I'm here
 
05:06:56.830 --> 05:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
to do that today but I'm also here to to
 
05:06:58.948 --> 05:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
offer our services if you're intending
 
05:07:01.070 --> 05:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
to write a bill that you think affects
 
05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
veterans we're resource that you can use
 
05:07:05.270 --> 05:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
to help make sure that that the bill
 
05:07:07.628 --> 05:07:07.638 align:start position:0%
says what you want it to say and and
 
05:07:09.948 --> 05:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
does what you want it to do our members
 
05:07:11.830 --> 05:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
unanimously support this bill to be
 
05:07:13.708 --> 05:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
honest most of them did not know that
 
05:07:16.190 --> 05:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
there was in fact an increased penalty
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
in uh uh in 651 for these other folks
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%

Responders and and police officers and
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
we feel like perhaps belong in that
 
05:07:30.270 --> 05:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
group as well um and I think it it's
 
05:07:33.510 --> 05:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
even more uh need needed now if you take
 
05:07:35.948 --> 05:07:35.958 align:start position:0%

motion yes Mr chairman
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
um just hearing the
 
05:10:03.910 --> 05:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
testimony it sounds
 
05:10:07.070 --> 05:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
like you know there are exemptions that
 
05:10:08.430 --> 05:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
you know especially the you know because
 
05:10:10.590 --> 05:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
of the emails I got they talked a lot
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
about the
 
05:10:14.510 --> 05:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
elderly um that there is you know about
 
05:10:17.310 --> 05:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
their medical conditions um and there
 
05:10:19.110 --> 05:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
was a gentleman that's I think he was
 
05:10:20.990 --> 05:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
from the prison that spoke on that and
 
05:10:22.788 --> 05:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
said um you know asked him the question
 
05:10:25.110 --> 05:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
and he said that you can get a medical
 
05:10:29.310 --> 05:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
exemption to have a parole here um you
 
05:10:33.270 --> 05:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
know the kids they from Nation
 
05:10:35.150 --> 05:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
um even though he was supporting the
 
05:10:37.430 --> 05:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill he just gave a lot of information
 
05:10:38.830 --> 05:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
you know it was almost like he was
 
05:10:41.070 --> 05:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
against the bill because he was saying
 
05:10:41.080 --> 05:10:42.350 align:start position:0%
against the bill because he was saying
how

05:10:42.350 --> 05:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:10:45.190 --> 05:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
wonderful the programs that he took and
 
05:10:48.910 --> 05:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
how it reduced his sentence in so I just
 
05:10:50.430 --> 05:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
look at this bill that it's not really
 
05:10:53.030 --> 05:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
needed I think that um you know the
 
05:10:55.190 --> 05:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
system is working and and I think we
 
05:10:58.030 --> 05:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
should go with that thank you Mr
 
05:11:01.270 --> 05:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
chairman representa GFF I did say I had
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
a motion but I think you didn't hear me
 
05:11:06.390 --> 05:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
but um with that said I'm going to vote
 
05:11:10.750 --> 05:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
against the itl and if you keep not just
 
05:11:10.760 --> 05:11:12.990 align:start position:0%
against the itl and if you keep not just
my

05:11:12.990 --> 05:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:11:16.670 --> 05:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
well people refer to the medical issue
 
05:11:20.590 --> 05:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
on 598 at no point the medical was
 
05:11:22.910 --> 05:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
discussed on 598 the medical was
 
05:11:24.150 --> 05:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
discussed on
 
05:11:27.070 --> 05:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
138 so just letting you
 
05:11:31.230 --> 05:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
know um what was important was the fact
 
05:11:34.948 --> 05:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
that we're the only one at
 
05:11:37.750 --> 05:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
100% And that's truly important the
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
other factor that came out in the middle
 
05:11:43.230 --> 05:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
of 598 was the fact that if you wanted
 
05:11:45.670 --> 05:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
to get earned credits you had to be able
 
05:11:47.948 --> 05:11:47.958 align:start position:0%
to afford to pay for
 
05:11:50.830 --> 05:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
it and if you were not able to pay it
 
05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
you couldn't get earned
 
05:11:54.590 --> 05:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
credits the other fact that came out
 
05:11:57.548 --> 05:11:57.558 align:start position:0%
that you go if you for one of the other
 
05:11:59.548 --> 05:11:59.558 align:start position:0%
um things that they had you go back
 
05:12:03.150 --> 05:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
before the judge this says you go back
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
before the board that tells you and gets
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
information from the doc as what type of
 
05:12:15.190 --> 05:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
person you've been in your term or what
 
05:12:18.150 --> 05:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
you've done to you know rehabilitate
 
05:12:21.990 --> 05:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
yourself that's entirely different from
 
05:12:24.830 --> 05:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
138 so I definitely would vote against
 
05:12:27.390 --> 05:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
this because I definitely feel that this
 
05:12:32.350 --> 05:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
is a good bill if my um colleages had a
 
05:12:35.110 --> 05:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
problem with the 50% where there many
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
states have 50% some states have done
 
05:12:41.350 --> 05:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
away with truth and sentencing and um
 
05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
the other fact that is last term when it
 
05:12:46.708 --> 05:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
was suggested that we have a committee
 
05:12:48.830 --> 05:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
it was Donna saitech that came and said
 
05:12:50.830 --> 05:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
and voted against that even though the
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
doc had recommended it so my point of
 
05:12:56.750 --> 05:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
the matter is is that you know either
 
05:12:58.948 --> 05:12:58.958 align:start position:0%
you for or you're not whether you're in
 
05:13:01.270 --> 05:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
a committee or you're not in a committee
 
05:13:16.788 --> 05:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:22.350 --> 05:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
bill representative thank you Mr chair
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
um I cannot I cannot support the bill
 
05:13:29.430 --> 05:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
because I find the bill to be uh too far
 
05:13:33.030 --> 05:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
too over far too broad this
 
05:13:35.310 --> 05:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
reach well it doesn't make wouldn't make
 
05:13:37.868 --> 05:13:37.878 align:start position:0%
any difference if a man if a person were
 
05:13:42.070 --> 05:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
in prison for DW in which you hurt
 
05:13:44.110 --> 05:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
nobody but
 
05:13:47.750 --> 05:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
yourself or you in prison for
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
murder you get a 50%
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
reduction and
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's different crimes should be
 
05:13:59.510 --> 05:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
treated in different ways and I can't
 
05:14:07.470 --> 05:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:11.670 --> 05:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
represent represent first okay
 
05:14:14.910 --> 05:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
new thank you Mr chairman
 
05:14:18.190 --> 05:14:18.200 align:start position:0%
um this hearing this bill was really uh
 
05:14:20.110 --> 05:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
an educational experience I think every
 
05:14:22.230 --> 05:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
time we hear one of these bills uh it's
 
05:14:24.750 --> 05:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
an educational experience for all of us
 
05:14:27.708 --> 05:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
I know as a first ter or the last time
 
05:14:31.110 --> 05:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
um it was semi overwhelming try to take
 
05:14:33.948 --> 05:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
trying to take in all of the uh the
 
05:14:36.270 --> 05:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
information and the points that are made
 
05:14:39.270 --> 05:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
I I and I I sympathize with those folks
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
who are here with us for the first time
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
while I'm sympathetic to the concerns
 
05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
that are raised or that were raised by
 
05:14:48.788 --> 05:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
the parole board and and while I'm uh
 
05:14:51.708 --> 05:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
always extremely sympathetic to to the
 
05:14:53.590 --> 05:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
families of victims I think the fact
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
remains that taking away a person's
 
05:14:59.150 --> 05:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
Freedom um in this state is the worst
 
05:15:01.750 --> 05:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
thing you can do to somebody and and
 
05:15:04.230 --> 05:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
think when you do that uh the standard
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh not only to send people to prison uh
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
but to keep them there has to be very
 
05:15:11.830 --> 05:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
high and when I look at the fact that so
 
05:15:14.548 --> 05:15:14.558 align:start position:0%
many other states have moved off of this
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
law um other states uh are I think the
 
05:15:21.510 --> 05:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
original federal law we heard testimony
 
05:15:24.470 --> 05:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
was 85% for truth and sentence say New
 
05:15:26.788 --> 05:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state that's at
 
05:15:29.470 --> 05:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
100% uh and most of the other states are
 
05:15:33.708 --> 05:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
far far below that and I ask myself why
 
05:15:35.750 --> 05:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of a lot of it comes
 
05:15:40.590 --> 05:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
back to the fact that we uh we do not uh
 
05:15:43.190 --> 05:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
properly invest in the parole process
 
05:15:46.548 --> 05:15:46.558 align:start position:0%
and in the parole board um they they
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
operate on shering resources and and I
 
05:15:52.708 --> 05:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
think one way to look at that is that
 
05:15:54.750 --> 05:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
saves us that definitely saves us some
 
05:15:56.788 --> 05:15:56.798 align:start position:0%
money but one of the other things it
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
does is it creates resource constraints
 
05:16:01.868 --> 05:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
uh that make it very very difficult for
 
05:16:03.430 --> 05:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
people who know how much work they'd be
 
05:16:05.788 --> 05:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
facing if we passed a bill like this to
 
05:16:08.270 --> 05:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead and pass it and when I ask
 
05:16:12.868 --> 05:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
myself what do I weigh more heavily is
 
05:16:16.708 --> 05:16:16.718 align:start position:0%
it keeping a broken system limping along
 
05:16:18.430 --> 05:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
uh is that is that the thing that's most
 
05:16:22.350 --> 05:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
important to me or is it making sure
 
05:16:24.310 --> 05:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
that somebody who deserves a chance of
 
05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
Freedom or who maybe has earned a chance
 
05:16:30.670 --> 05:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
um giving them just the right to have a
 
05:16:30.680 --> 05:16:32.150 align:start position:0%
um giving them just the right to have a
review

05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
review
 
05:16:37.430 --> 05:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and so I'll be voting against the itl
 
05:16:40.070 --> 05:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
um my guess is is this issue uh is going
 
05:16:42.310 --> 05:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
to be one of those issues that uh that
 
05:16:44.110 --> 05:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
keeps coming back to us not only in
 
05:16:45.628 --> 05:16:45.638 align:start position:0%
other bills this session but in bills
 
05:16:47.868 --> 05:16:47.878 align:start position:0%
and other sessions and I I would just
 
05:16:50.830 --> 05:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
urge everybody um I I wish I would have
 
05:16:52.430 --> 05:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
prepared a little bit better for this
 
05:16:55.750 --> 05:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
today because this is an issue that
 
05:16:55.760 --> 05:16:58.110 align:start position:0%
today because this is an issue that
really

05:16:58.110 --> 05:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
deserves any and all attention that we
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
can put into it
 
05:17:05.470 --> 05:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
this really does affect uh the lives of
 
05:17:07.390 --> 05:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
the people who are in prison it affects
 
05:17:10.670 --> 05:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
the lives of their families at home um
 
05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
it affects us and our entire criminal
 
05:17:17.190 --> 05:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
justice system so thank
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent representative
 
05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
tman you recognize thank you uh I have
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
two points U I received a letter from a
 
05:17:32.990 --> 05:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
prisoner on this uh opposing
 
05:17:37.110 --> 05:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
but the letter and granted you know I
 
05:17:39.750 --> 05:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
have no no background on him than what
 
05:17:42.390 --> 05:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
was in his letter it wasn't very
 
05:17:44.070 --> 05:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
sympathetic when you really shipped it
 
05:17:44.080 --> 05:17:45.430 align:start position:0%
sympathetic when you really shipped it
away

05:17:45.430 --> 05:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
because he wasn't like the people who
 
05:17:51.190 --> 05:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
testified were former prisoners you he
 
05:17:53.390 --> 05:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
he clearly was not
 
05:17:56.110 --> 05:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
accepting his part in in being
 
05:17:58.230 --> 05:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
incarcerated he was merely complaining
 
05:18:01.628 --> 05:18:01.638 align:start position:0%
about how bad the system was so you I
 
05:18:03.708 --> 05:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
think we need to be very careful with
 
05:18:06.948 --> 05:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
the people who testify
 
05:18:10.510 --> 05:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
because there they are people who have
 
05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
learned how how it works and you know
 
05:18:17.310 --> 05:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
they present a good pH the other thing
 
05:18:20.548 --> 05:18:20.558 align:start position:0%
is I heard today
 
05:18:22.830 --> 05:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
about and these kind they said these
 
05:18:24.390 --> 05:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
05:18:28.070 --> 05:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
laws Drive how many people we have in
 
05:18:31.788 --> 05:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
prison and the impression you get is
 
05:18:36.628 --> 05:18:36.638 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is is
 
05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
imprisoning more people than we really
 
05:18:41.470 --> 05:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
ought to more people probably than any
 
05:18:45.310 --> 05:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
other state and so on and that's just
 
05:18:49.070 --> 05:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
not true I looked up the statistics on
 
05:18:51.948 --> 05:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
the incarceration by state out of 50
 
05:18:54.788 --> 05:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
states we're in the bottom five of those
 
05:18:57.150 --> 05:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
and and there's just there's a group of
 
05:18:59.948 --> 05:18:59.958 align:start position:0%
them that are just sort of plus or minus
 
05:19:02.750 --> 05:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
a few different but we don't incarcerate
 
05:19:06.430 --> 05:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
that many people that tells me that the
 
05:19:08.110 --> 05:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
I don't care really what other states
 
05:19:10.150 --> 05:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
are doing but yeah I think maybe we're
 
05:19:11.750 --> 05:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing about the balance
 
05:19:15.628 --> 05:19:15.638 align:start position:0%
of who we keep and and who we let go so
 
05:19:19.390 --> 05:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative represent
 
05:19:25.030 --> 05:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman couple things
 
05:19:26.590 --> 05:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
stood out from that testimony earlier
 
05:19:29.390 --> 05:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
today one was a comment that hard cases
 
05:19:33.310 --> 05:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
make bad laws um that was in reference
 
05:19:35.590 --> 05:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
as I understand to a very
 
05:19:39.470 --> 05:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
awful uh homicide and a miscarriage of
 
05:19:41.350 --> 05:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
Justice relative to the
 
05:19:45.750 --> 05:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
sentencing that changed Newan uh
 
05:19:48.070 --> 05:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
basically our our sentencing structure
 
05:19:51.070 --> 05:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
for every other criminal that is then
 
05:19:52.948 --> 05:19:52.958 align:start position:0%
sentenced in the
 
05:19:55.510 --> 05:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
future another thing stood out is after
 
05:19:55.520 --> 05:19:56.350 align:start position:0%
future another thing stood out is after
that

05:19:56.350 --> 05:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
change uh sentencing itself did not
 
05:20:04.708 --> 05:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
reflect new TR and sentencing so uh
 
05:20:06.628 --> 05:20:06.638 align:start position:0%
which is what former speaker scitech
 
05:20:10.150 --> 05:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
indicated so uh the result of that was a
 
05:20:12.510 --> 05:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
tenfold increase in the number of people
 
05:20:14.548 --> 05:20:14.558 align:start position:0%
serving prison sentences in our state
 
05:20:17.708 --> 05:20:17.718 align:start position:0%
from around 200 to around 2,000 now it's
 
05:20:20.070 --> 05:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
nice to know that it's declining
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
slowly but uh this bill makes a uniform
 
05:20:28.548 --> 05:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
approach to addressing a prior
 
05:20:31.830 --> 05:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
wrong um we heard about program in in
 
05:20:34.708 --> 05:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
the system that determine when somebody
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
could be eligible for parole that system
 
05:20:40.150 --> 05:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
can adjust to this new
 
05:20:45.150 --> 05:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
standard um and lastly I'd say that um
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
this is not saying somebody will be
 
05:20:48.670 --> 05:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
pared it will say they are eligible for
 
05:20:50.788 --> 05:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
a hearing that's those are two very
 
05:20:52.708 --> 05:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
different things these are ways to sort
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
of speed up somebody's
 
05:20:56.750 --> 05:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation it's a good bill and we
 
05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:00.040 --> 05:21:02.510 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:21:02.510 --> 05:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:21:05.868 --> 05:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
representative pakas yes thank you Mr
 
05:21:11.670 --> 05:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
chairman in 2004 representative Welch
 
05:21:14.788 --> 05:21:14.798 align:start position:0%
appointed me to do a study on the prison
 
05:21:19.470 --> 05:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:22.830 --> 05:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
264 people in
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
1984 in
 
05:21:29.030 --> 05:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
2004 we were at 2
 
05:21:33.548 --> 05:21:33.558 align:start position:0%
2600 and the truth and czen law needs to
 
05:21:36.670 --> 05:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
be looked into and we need to change
 
05:21:39.948 --> 05:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
it maybe this bill won't do it but
 
05:21:42.708 --> 05:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
everybody better think about that I hear
 
05:21:45.948 --> 05:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
everybody all these Cuts being made but
 
05:21:48.190 --> 05:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
the prison is still going to people are
 
05:21:50.070 --> 05:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
going to have to be dead in the clothes
 
05:21:53.670 --> 05:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
and whatnot we need to look into
 
05:21:58.190 --> 05:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:02.310 --> 05:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
you represent represent Newman
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will be uh opposing
 
05:22:09.548 --> 05:22:09.558 align:start position:0%
the itl on this bill I also think that
 
05:22:12.190 --> 05:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's a good bill and serves its
 
05:22:15.510 --> 05:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
purpose um I also thought I thought I
 
05:22:18.230 --> 05:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
heard a comment that we ought to be
 
05:22:20.750 --> 05:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
careful about people that testify and I
 
05:22:23.310 --> 05:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
am completely um confused by that
 
05:22:29.948 --> 05:22:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:29.958 --> 05:22:34.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:22:34.510 --> 05:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:34.520 --> 05:22:37.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:22:37.110 --> 05:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:22:39.430 --> 05:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
represent thank you
 
05:22:43.390 --> 05:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
CH after a lot of lot of thinking about
 
05:22:45.990 --> 05:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm I'm going to support the I
 
05:22:48.670 --> 05:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
but I think that what we should think
 
05:22:51.510 --> 05:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
about doing in the near future is
 
05:22:54.910 --> 05:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
adjusting the uh uh sentences that we
 
05:22:59.910 --> 05:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
are now put have put in our uh system
 
05:23:03.150 --> 05:23:03.160 align:start position:0%
and uh that would address some of the
 
05:23:07.190 --> 05:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
issues of what what how many people we
 
05:23:10.788 --> 05:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
are imprisoning and I so I'm willing to
 
05:23:16.230 --> 05:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:19.868 --> 05:23:19.878 align:start position:0%
you g yes I just want to say again that
 
05:23:21.990 --> 05:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
um even at half your sentences it
 
05:23:23.868 --> 05:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that you're going to be
 
05:23:28.030 --> 05:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
parole so if we believe that our parole
 
05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
folks are honest upfront
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
and doing their job they're not going to
 
05:23:36.708 --> 05:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
just let anyone go this is an
 
05:23:39.868 --> 05:23:39.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a person that could
 
05:23:41.868 --> 05:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
possibly be eligible because they've
 
05:23:43.270 --> 05:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
done their programming they've done
 
05:23:45.590 --> 05:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
whatever's necessary to
 
05:23:49.350 --> 05:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate to have that opportunity to
 
05:23:51.628 --> 05:23:51.638 align:start position:0%
go before the parole board but
 
05:23:54.070 --> 05:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
again those on the parole board are the
 
05:23:57.230 --> 05:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
ones that make the decision so I'm
 
05:24:00.190 --> 05:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
asking my teammates to vote against the
 
05:24:00.200 --> 05:24:05.150 align:start position:0%
asking my teammates to vote against the
itl

05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:07.070 --> 05:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative rhods thank you Mr
 
05:24:09.470 --> 05:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a question that might be
 
05:24:11.628 --> 05:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
um it might actually you might be able
 
05:24:14.190 --> 05:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
to answer this but goes also along the
 
05:24:17.150 --> 05:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
lines of what representative was saying
 
05:24:20.190 --> 05:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
there appears to be a lot of a lot of
 
05:24:23.788 --> 05:24:23.798 align:start position:0%
not in this particular Bill
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
and part where where it starts is a
 
05:24:29.990 --> 05:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
question I have would this would this
 
05:24:31.270 --> 05:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
apply for
 
05:24:33.230 --> 05:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
future sentences or does this almost
 
05:24:37.310 --> 05:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
look at everybody that is now in you
 
05:24:40.150 --> 05:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
know in prison like how like how far
 
05:24:43.230 --> 05:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
back would it go my interpretation of of
 
05:24:46.190 --> 05:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
the bill as drafted is it would apply to
 
05:24:48.708 --> 05:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
all sentences including people are
 
05:24:51.110 --> 05:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
currently incarcerated as well as people
 
05:24:53.628 --> 05:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
that are incarcerated the future that's
 
05:24:57.548 --> 05:24:57.558 align:start position:0%
right and um it's 60 I'm sorry it's 60
 
05:24:57.558 --> 05:24:59.670 align:start position:0%
right and um it's 60 I'm sorry it's 60
days

05:24:59.670 --> 05:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
days
 
05:24:59.680 --> 05:25:02.868 align:start position:0%
days
AC

05:25:02.868 --> 05:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:05.390 --> 05:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
to become law but for everybody that's
 
05:25:08.830 --> 05:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
in I'm sorry you're right so if
 
05:25:10.948 --> 05:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
someone's in already in prison right now
 
05:25:13.628 --> 05:25:13.638 align:start position:0%
serving a sentence and let's say they
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
serve 60% of their minimum sentence
 
05:25:18.670 --> 05:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
already the minimum sentence five years
 
05:25:21.830 --> 05:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible to two and a half
 
05:25:23.590 --> 05:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
years even if they serve three years
 
05:25:25.590 --> 05:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
that mean they would be eligible for the
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:29.680 --> 05:25:33.310 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:25:33.310 --> 05:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:36.190 --> 05:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
so I just want to you know you guys use
 
05:25:37.948 --> 05:25:37.958 align:start position:0%
the term eligible for parole which I
 
05:25:40.390 --> 05:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
noticed that when I um had gone to them
 
05:25:41.750 --> 05:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
I had put something different but they
 
05:25:44.948 --> 05:25:44.958 align:start position:0%
did put eligible but for me I don't look
 
05:25:47.030 --> 05:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
at it that way I think that it gives
 
05:25:49.868 --> 05:25:49.878 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to go before parole
 
05:25:53.110 --> 05:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
board just that simple it's an
 
05:25:54.830 --> 05:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go before the parole
 
05:25:57.670 --> 05:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
board and I believe that the parole
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
board would make the right
 
05:25:59.600 --> 05:26:02.660 align:start position:0%
board would make the right
decisions

05:26:02.660 --> 05:26:02.670 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:02.670 --> 05:26:05.948 align:start position:0%

justice committee last year as House
Bill

05:29:28.190 --> 05:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:29:30.910 --> 05:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
1263 where it was recommended ought to
 
05:29:34.350 --> 05:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
pass by an 18-2 vote then went on to the
 
05:29:37.110 --> 05:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
house calendar and finally moved to the

covid-19 excuse me hus Bill 576 would
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
amend the provision of the state's
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%

trafficking or sexual abuse to be filed
 
05:29:58.708 --> 05:29:58.718 align:start position:0%
at any time the nature of sex
 
05:30:01.590 --> 05:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
trafficking is unique due to the common
 
05:30:03.910 --> 05:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
trauma bonding that occurs between the
 
05:30:07.350 --> 05:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
victim and the offender because of this
 
05:30:09.948 --> 05:30:09.958 align:start position:0%
Bond it is common for survivors of
 
05:30:13.708 --> 05:30:13.718 align:start position:0%
trafficking to not rec re uh recognize
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
their own victimization until they've
 
05:30:18.788 --> 05:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
received comprehensive care and
 
05:30:21.628 --> 05:30:21.638 align:start position:0%
services this realization could happen
 
05:30:24.990 --> 05:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
any time after victimization and is also
 
05:30:27.708 --> 05:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
compounded by the fact that in the sex

acknowledgement is made that the

recognition of victimization and
 
05:30:50.708 --> 05:30:50.718 align:start position:0%
obtaining enough stability to file for
 
05:30:53.470 --> 05:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
compensation can happen many years after
 
05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
exploitation ceases and that the victims
 
05:30:58.590 --> 05:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
are still deserving and needing of
 
05:31:01.788 --> 05:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
compens compensation if they choose to
 
05:31:04.430 --> 05:31:04.440 align:start position:0%

05:31:13.910 --> 05:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
the filing deadline for child victims of

familial sex
 
05:31:23.910 --> 05:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
trafficking House Bill 576 would also
 
05:31:25.990 --> 05:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
remove the contributory fault
 
05:31:28.910 --> 05:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
consideration for compensation relative
 
05:31:31.350 --> 05:31:31.360 align:start position:0%

05:31:37.350 --> 05:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
offenses is an inherent element of sex
 
05:31:39.628 --> 05:31:39.638 align:start position:0%
traffic trafficking
 
05:31:42.110 --> 05:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
victimization trafficking victims do not
 
05:31:44.788 --> 05:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
engage in commercial sex or unlawful
 
05:31:48.310 --> 05:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
practices by choice but are coerced by
 
05:31:50.270 --> 05:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
either fraud deceit or
 
05:31:52.990 --> 05:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
survival as such to suggest that human
 
05:31:55.510 --> 05:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
trafficking survivors May contribute to
 
05:31:58.070 --> 05:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
their own victimization would appear
 
05:32:00.868 --> 05:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
unjust considering their circum
 
05:32:03.548 --> 05:32:03.558 align:start position:0%
ances I know that last year concerns
 
05:32:06.628 --> 05:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
arose about around the possibility that
 
05:32:09.430 --> 05:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
excessive claims would be generated if
 
05:32:11.590 --> 05:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
the two-year deadline was
 
05:32:14.868 --> 05:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
removed um I checked with the Department
 
05:32:18.548 --> 05:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
of Justice and in 2020 the Compensation
 
05:32:21.030 --> 05:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
Program reported that a
 
05:32:24.628 --> 05:32:24.638 align:start position:0%
425 applications for compensation that
 
05:32:28.510 --> 05:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
were approved 33 were child sexual
 
05:32:30.990 --> 05:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
assault claims and the were no claims
 
05:32:33.948 --> 05:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
related to human trafficking in
 
05:32:36.590 --> 05:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
conclusion New Hampshire's taken Giant
 
05:32:39.230 --> 05:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
Steps in the area of human trafficking
 
05:32:41.628 --> 05:32:41.638 align:start position:0%
by including child victims of sex
 
05:32:44.670 --> 05:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
trafficking under the definition of of
 
05:32:47.270 --> 05:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
abused and allowing the vacating of
 
05:32:49.948 --> 05:32:49.958 align:start position:0%
nonviolent crimes committed by minors
 
05:32:54.990 --> 05:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
being trafficked for sex HB 576 provides
 
05:32:57.948 --> 05:32:57.958 align:start position:0%

05:33:04.030 --> 05:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
access some form of compensation long
 
05:33:05.948 --> 05:33:05.958 align:start position:0%
after the egregious crime was
 
05:33:16.030 --> 05:33:16.040 align:start position:0%

the previous term do you mind repeating
 
05:33:33.750 --> 05:33:33.760 align:start position:0%

05:33:40.110 --> 05:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
you know did is there a reason why

there's not a fiscal note attached to
 
05:33:45.230 --> 05:33:45.240 align:start position:0%

guess why there is no physical note
 
05:34:09.948 --> 05:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
because the money is not going against
 
05:34:12.350 --> 05:34:12.360 align:start position:0%

05:36:59.708 --> 05:36:59.718 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking and clean and sober for
 
05:37:02.868 --> 05:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
13 years um I want to say that the
 
05:37:04.788 --> 05:37:04.798 align:start position:0%
experience is very traumatizing and it
 
05:37:07.230 --> 05:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
took over 10 years for me to tell anyone
 
05:37:09.190 --> 05:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
what happened to me and I believe that
 
05:37:11.230 --> 05:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
time should not be a factor to apply for
 
05:37:13.030 --> 05:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
victims compensation because many
 
05:37:15.390 --> 05:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
victims like me don't tell anyone
 
05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
because sometimes we don't even know
 
05:37:19.910 --> 05:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
that there is any help available or
 
05:37:21.510 --> 05:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
because we're so ashamed we don't talk
 
05:37:24.310 --> 05:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
about it I personally had no idea there
 
05:37:26.910 --> 05:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
was victims compensation funding and
 
05:37:29.110 --> 05:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
there is very limited funds available
 
05:37:30.670 --> 05:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
and it's such a small amount that the
 
05:37:32.470 --> 05:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
opponents will probably testify against
 
05:37:35.110 --> 05:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
the bill on that presence so even a
 
05:37:36.670 --> 05:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
small amount of financial help might
 
05:37:38.230 --> 05:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
make the difference between getting some
 
05:37:40.030 --> 05:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
counseling or clothing for a job so
 
05:37:42.310 --> 05:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
we're able to restart our lives and move
 
05:37:44.628 --> 05:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
forward so please
 
05:37:48.470 --> 05:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass on HB 576 and remove
 
05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
time as a limitation from victim's
 
05:37:58.110 --> 05:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:01.230 --> 05:38:01.240 align:start position:0%

half of
 
05:38:33.310 --> 05:38:33.320 align:start position:0%

05:38:41.708 --> 05:38:41.718 align:start position:0%
with my testimony in two minutes but I
 
05:38:45.070 --> 05:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
just want to share my personal story um
 
05:38:47.310 --> 05:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
I'm a victim of sexual
 
05:38:50.948 --> 05:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
assault um I was raped by my my own
 
05:38:53.030 --> 05:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
father but that's not not that that's
 
05:38:56.350 --> 05:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
not the whole story so when I was 15
 
05:39:00.788 --> 05:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
years old I met my ex-husband uh who was
 
05:39:03.390 --> 05:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
47 years old when I met him I was only
 
05:39:08.708 --> 05:39:08.718 align:start position:0%
15 years old but for me my story um to
 
05:39:11.110 --> 05:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
survive started when I was 15 and I met
 
05:39:14.548 --> 05:39:14.558 align:start position:0%
him he promised me to bring me to the US
 
05:39:17.548 --> 05:39:17.558 align:start position:0%
and I he promised me to better life
 
05:39:20.350 --> 05:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
after being Abus since I was five years
 
05:39:24.510 --> 05:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
old um he um he was a US
 
05:39:29.190 --> 05:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
citizen uh he um traveled back to the US
 
05:39:34.230 --> 05:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
he sent me um with some people to travel
 
05:39:38.070 --> 05:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
to the US when I was um going through um
 
05:39:39.510 --> 05:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
guala in
 
05:39:42.750 --> 05:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
Mexico I was abused I was sexual
 
05:39:45.310 --> 05:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
assault by couple of people that I don't
 
05:39:46.628 --> 05:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
even know who they
 
05:39:49.628 --> 05:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
are and then the last time I was abused
 
05:39:53.150 --> 05:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
by these people it was when I got to
 
05:39:56.548 --> 05:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
California that was 33 years
 
05:40:00.670 --> 05:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
ago I believe vict they should have the
 
05:40:03.830 --> 05:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
right even though after 30 years or 10
 
05:40:06.670 --> 05:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
years or whatever they should have the
 
05:40:09.788 --> 05:40:09.798 align:start position:0%
the ability to ask for
 
05:40:13.468 --> 05:40:13.478 align:start position:0%
help um it is hard for me to speak about
 
05:40:15.990 --> 05:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
this and I'm proud to be a US citizen
 
05:40:17.910 --> 05:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
I'm proud of like everything that I
 
05:40:20.310 --> 05:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
accomplished I graduated from college
 
05:40:24.110 --> 05:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
when I was 42 years old I went through
 
05:40:27.670 --> 05:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
domestic violence I went through sexual
 
05:40:30.830 --> 05:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
abuse but to be honest I'm proud of to
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
I'm proud to to be who I am right now
 
05:40:36.670 --> 05:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
and proud who who the person that I come
 
05:40:38.750 --> 05:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
but without the help all all these
 
05:40:41.430 --> 05:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
organizations and without all the
 
05:40:44.110 --> 05:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
support that I got I don't think I
 
05:40:46.110 --> 05:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make it this
 
05:40:49.510 --> 05:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
far and be able to help other victims
 
05:40:52.030 --> 05:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I have the courage to be
 
05:40:54.270 --> 05:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
talking to you and to be sharing my
 
05:40:57.788 --> 05:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
story is not easy but I think sharing my
 
05:41:00.070 --> 05:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
story is going to help other victim
 
05:41:02.190 --> 05:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
and then it's going to help you to
 
05:41:04.590 --> 05:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
understand that victims they need help
 
05:41:08.990 --> 05:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
even after two years or 10

Hampshire Department of corrections I am

here in support of House Bill 576 I did
 
05:42:05.628 --> 05:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
submit my written testimony
 
05:42:07.830 --> 05:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday as an advocate working for the
 
05:42:09.750 --> 05:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
victim Services Unit part of our job is
 
05:42:12.590 --> 05:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
to assist victims by referring them to
 
05:42:14.708 --> 05:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
or submitting applications for financial
 
05:42:15.910 --> 05:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
assistance through the victim's
 
05:42:18.788 --> 05:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
compensation Fund in fiscal year 2020
 
05:42:20.990 --> 05:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
the victim Services Unit assisted seven
 
05:42:22.830 --> 05:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
victims with victims compensation
 
05:42:25.150 --> 05:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
applications and so far in fiscal year
 
05:42:27.788 --> 05:42:27.798 align:start position:0%
2021 we have assisted eight victims with
 
05:42:30.110 --> 05:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
applications of all of the applications
 
05:42:32.670 --> 05:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
we have assisted thus far five
 
05:42:34.948 --> 05:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
individuals are survivors of sexual
 
05:42:36.548 --> 05:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
assault in beyond the two-year time
 
05:42:38.430 --> 05:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
frame outline outlined in the current
 
05:42:40.110 --> 05:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
statute although the number of
 
05:42:41.868 --> 05:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
individuals that we assist with these
 
05:42:43.868 --> 05:42:43.878 align:start position:0%
compensation claims seems small the
 
05:42:46.150 --> 05:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
impact that the financial assistance can
 
05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
have on an individual victim and his or
 
05:42:51.030 --> 05:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
her family can be astronomical as it
 
05:42:52.750 --> 05:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
removes some of the financial barriers
 
05:42:54.750 --> 05:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
for victims as they take steps forward
 
05:42:57.510 --> 05:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
in their unique healing process in cases
 
05:42:59.150 --> 05:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
where Advocates are working with victims
 
05:43:00.750 --> 05:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
to submit applications for victim's
 
05:43:02.830 --> 05:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
compensation the reason for application
 
05:43:04.510 --> 05:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
Mo most often centers around the
 
05:43:06.628 --> 05:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
victim's desire and need to re-engage in
 
05:43:08.990 --> 05:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
trauma inform therapy relocate for
 
05:43:10.948 --> 05:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
safety purposes or for victim offender
 
05:43:13.468 --> 05:43:13.478 align:start position:0%
dialogue expenses without the financial
 
05:43:15.310 --> 05:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
assistance provided by the compensation
 
05:43:17.468 --> 05:43:17.478 align:start position:0%
fund many of these victims may go years
 
05:43:20.070 --> 05:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
without the support or therapy necessary
 
05:43:22.110 --> 05:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
to continue to move forward towards full
 
05:43:24.390 --> 05:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
healing or may continue to live in fear
 
05:43:27.548 --> 05:43:27.558 align:start position:0%
due the due to the inability to relocate
 
05:43:29.190 --> 05:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
within the past week I personally have
 
05:43:30.708 --> 05:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
worked with a survivor of childhood
 
05:43:32.708 --> 05:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
sexual assault who has been consistently
 
05:43:34.350 --> 05:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
harassed by her perpetrator through
 
05:43:36.030 --> 05:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
phone calls letters and by thirdparty
 
05:43:38.350 --> 05:43:38.360 align:start position:0%
Family contact even though the offender
 
05:43:40.628 --> 05:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
has remained incarcerated due to the
 
05:43:42.310 --> 05:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
harassment and the reality of the
 
05:43:43.948 --> 05:43:43.958 align:start position:0%
offender's eventual release into the
 
05:43:45.510 --> 05:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
community the victim is seeking
 
05:43:46.750 --> 05:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
financial assistance through the
 
05:43:49.230 --> 05:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
Compensation Program to relocate to a
 
05:43:50.708 --> 05:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
new area where the offender will be
 
05:43:53.190 --> 05:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
unaware of her location and she can feel
 
05:43:54.948 --> 05:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
safe and free from the harassment and
 
05:43:57.430 --> 05:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
intimidation she has experienced but due
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
to her Current financial constraints and
 
05:44:02.030 --> 05:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
the expenses related to re relocating
 
05:44:04.270 --> 05:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
without the assistance of the victim's
 
05:44:06.150 --> 05:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
compensation funding this victim may not
 
05:44:08.350 --> 05:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
be able to re locate and will continue
 
05:44:10.150 --> 05:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
to be harassed by the offender and his
 
05:44:14.030 --> 05:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
extended family how we do have to limit
 
05:44:16.070 --> 05:44:16.080 align:start position:0%

05:44:39.430 --> 05:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:42.310 --> 05:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
dun Mr chair members of the committee
 
05:44:44.468 --> 05:44:44.478 align:start position:0%
I'm Bob Dunn the director of public
 
05:44:47.390 --> 05:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
policy for the Roman Catholic dasis of
 
05:44:50.230 --> 05:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester and uh I'm here today to
 
05:44:53.350 --> 05:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
register our support for House Bill
 
05:44:56.150 --> 05:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
576 um I just said this to the committee
 
05:44:58.030 --> 05:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure a couple of weeks ago on House
 
05:45:00.390 --> 05:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 180 but the Catholic Church
 
05:45:03.708 --> 05:45:03.718 align:start position:0%
worldwide sees human trafficking as uh
 
05:45:06.390 --> 05:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
to use the words of Pope Francis nothing
 
05:45:08.868 --> 05:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
less than as he says one of the great
 
05:45:13.190 --> 05:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
evils of our age um and I think uh in
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
looking at a bill like this it's
 
05:45:18.070 --> 05:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
important to think about escaping from
 
05:45:20.270 --> 05:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
Human Trafficking as something that
 
05:45:23.390 --> 05:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
involves not just the first minutes of
 
05:45:26.270 --> 05:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
that event but it also involves the
 
05:45:29.430 --> 05:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
ensuing months and years as well
 
05:45:32.270 --> 05:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
so bills like this obviously help
 
05:45:34.270 --> 05:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
trafficking victims in that
 
05:45:37.628 --> 05:45:37.638 align:start position:0%
indispensable effort of forging a new
 
05:45:40.350 --> 05:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
post-trafficking life so I want to say
 
05:45:42.310 --> 05:45:42.320 align:start position:0%

443 thank you Mr chair Mr chair I move
 
06:07:58.190 --> 06:07:58.200 align:start position:0%

legislate and Mr chairman I'll second it
 
06:08:03.350 --> 06:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind you can recogniz
 
06:08:05.948 --> 06:08:05.958 align:start position:0%
second that motion you wish to speak on
 
06:08:08.190 --> 06:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
your motion of inexp to legisl thank you
 
06:08:12.468 --> 06:08:12.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:16.430 --> 06:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
um this is again an overly broad
 
06:08:21.750 --> 06:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
Bill uh that says uh that extends
 
06:08:24.590 --> 06:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh protection to military
 
06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
personnel however if if uh you were in a
 
06:08:31.868 --> 06:08:31.878 align:start position:0%
bar somewhere and got into a fight with
 
06:08:34.990 --> 06:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
a man or a woman and then found out
 
06:08:36.190 --> 06:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
afterwards that they were in the
 
06:08:38.948 --> 06:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
military this law applies to you and you
 
06:08:41.430 --> 06:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
had no idea they were in the
 
06:08:44.548 --> 06:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
military that is a major fault I find in
 
06:08:44.558 --> 06:08:45.270 align:start position:0%
military that is a major fault I find in
the

06:08:45.270 --> 06:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:08:50.390 --> 06:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
bill but the major fault I find in the
 
06:08:55.708 --> 06:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
bill is because I do not favor making
 
06:08:55.718 --> 06:08:57.670 align:start position:0%
bill is because I do not favor making
blists

06:08:57.670 --> 06:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
blists
 
06:09:00.788 --> 06:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
I do not favor making list that says
 
06:09:02.990 --> 06:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
some people are more worthy of
 
06:09:05.910 --> 06:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
protection under the law I believe we
 
06:09:08.548 --> 06:09:08.558 align:start position:0%
should always go with equal protection
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
under the law and that's why I move itl
 
06:09:13.270 --> 06:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
06:09:16.270 --> 06:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
chair was it
 
06:09:20.548 --> 06:09:20.558 align:start position:0%
yes thank and I I appreciate the
 
06:09:22.788 --> 06:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
comments and really I think it's
 
06:09:25.830 --> 06:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
important even if the the actor knew the
 
06:09:27.510 --> 06:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
person was a member the arm services
 
06:09:29.468 --> 06:09:29.478 align:start position:0%
that person may not be active at the
 
06:09:32.350 --> 06:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
time and it's that special class that
 
06:09:35.150 --> 06:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
you refering to still be implicated even
 
06:09:37.910 --> 06:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
when the person's on active duty and I
 
06:09:40.868 --> 06:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
think I believe
 
06:09:43.310 --> 06:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
that that that would be
 
06:09:43.320 --> 06:09:47.430 align:start position:0%
that that that would be
problem

06:09:47.430 --> 06:09:47.440 align:start position:0%

24 and today I'm presenting HG
 
06:12:59.190 --> 06:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
196 which talks about this uh defensive
 
06:13:00.110 --> 06:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
use of
 
06:13:03.190 --> 06:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
firearm I'm sorry defensive display of
 
06:13:03.200 --> 06:13:07.750 align:start position:0%
firearm I'm sorry defensive display of
firearms

06:13:07.750 --> 06:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:11.628 --> 06:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh we talked about the subject
 
06:13:16.788 --> 06:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
before this one is also uh simple
 
06:13:20.230 --> 06:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
clarification of our F
 
06:13:23.468 --> 06:13:23.478 align:start position:0%
law where we're trying to prevent lives
 
06:13:26.670 --> 06:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
uh from being lost we're trying to save
 
06:13:29.670 --> 06:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to deescalate things we
 
06:13:32.628 --> 06:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
really would like to not resort to the
 
06:13:33.628 --> 06:13:33.638 align:start position:0%
use of
 
06:13:36.628 --> 06:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
firearms that's why we're
 
06:13:39.110 --> 06:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
trying that's why defensive display of
 
06:13:40.830 --> 06:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
firearm is a good thing it's a solid
 
06:13:42.430 --> 06:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
thing I believe it should be
 
06:13:44.788 --> 06:13:44.798 align:start position:0%
encouraged because I'd rather everybody
 
06:13:46.430 --> 06:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
walked away peacefully from any
 
06:13:49.390 --> 06:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
encounter they were facing their
 
06:13:53.030 --> 06:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
lives rather to resort to something else
 
06:13:56.708 --> 06:13:56.718 align:start position:0%
to violence so again this might change
 
06:13:58.750 --> 06:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
are quite simple it's just a few lines
 
06:13:59.830 --> 06:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
they don't talk about the use of
 
06:14:02.310 --> 06:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
firearms this is about displaying a
 
06:14:04.830 --> 06:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
firearm very similar to that you've
 
06:14:06.990 --> 06:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
previously heard
 
06:14:11.510 --> 06:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
here uh because
 
06:14:14.868 --> 06:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
um yes and and this change needs to be
 
06:14:18.708 --> 06:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
made in the chapter uh the DU with
 
06:14:21.670 --> 06:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
criminal trespassing and criminal
 
06:14:24.590 --> 06:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
threatening my bill makes an
 
06:14:27.750 --> 06:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
exception to display a
 
06:14:30.110 --> 06:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
firearm in cases when there is Criminal
 
06:14:34.830 --> 06:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:38.150 --> 06:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
on um so
 
06:14:41.468 --> 06:14:41.478 align:start position:0%
again I I want to make sure the citizens
 
06:14:43.708 --> 06:14:43.718 align:start position:0%
who display powerarm who trying to warn
 
06:14:47.670 --> 06:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
of any potential trouble do not face
 
06:14:51.430 --> 06:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
persecution persecution or any kind and
 
06:14:53.350 --> 06:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
this is what my bill is about it's quite
 
06:14:55.590 --> 06:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
simple nothing to do with the use it's
 
06:15:00.548 --> 06:15:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:02.750 --> 06:15:02.760 align:start position:0%

question thank you and thank you for
 
06:15:16.070 --> 06:15:16.080 align:start position:0%

06:15:22.190 --> 06:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:22.200 --> 06:15:23.948 align:start position:0%
um
display

06:15:23.948 --> 06:15:23.958 align:start position:0%
display
 
06:15:27.590 --> 06:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
definition is brandish if you are doing
 
06:15:31.510 --> 06:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:35.628 --> 06:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:46.310 --> 06:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:48.948 --> 06:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
believe the have you
 
06:15:51.190 --> 06:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
know I'm not an expert on English
 
06:15:55.788 --> 06:15:55.798 align:start position:0%
language it's not my native tongue um so
 
06:15:57.350 --> 06:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
the I have it
 
06:16:00.070 --> 06:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
described display is something uh which
 
06:16:02.190 --> 06:16:02.200 align:start position:0%
you show you make it visible you make it
 
06:16:06.230 --> 06:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:10.030 --> 06:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
brandish it contain intent to cause harm
 
06:16:11.990 --> 06:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
somebody else I think it is not defined
 
06:16:20.350 --> 06:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:24.390 --> 06:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
word represent representa calling
 
06:16:27.070 --> 06:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative
 
06:16:29.910 --> 06:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
I think what you're proposing is already
 
06:16:31.708 --> 06:16:31.718 align:start position:0%
covered quite well in statute would it
 
06:16:34.030 --> 06:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to read the current
 
06:16:36.310 --> 06:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
statute and then ask you to explain how
 
06:16:39.310 --> 06:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:43.468 --> 06:16:43.478 align:start position:0%
differ uh if I a question so yes the
 
06:16:45.628 --> 06:16:45.638 align:start position:0%
question so I will read the statute and
 
06:16:47.390 --> 06:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
then ask for clarity so the statute
 
06:16:49.230 --> 06:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
currently reads
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
6314 section four person who responds to
 
06:16:54.190 --> 06:16:54.200 align:start position:0%
a threat which would be considered by a
 
06:16:56.670 --> 06:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable person as like to cause
 
06:16:59.310 --> 06:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
bodily injury or death to the person or
 
06:17:02.150 --> 06:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
to another by displaying a firearm or
 
06:17:04.510 --> 06:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
other means of self-defense with the
 
06:17:06.868 --> 06:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
intent to warn away the person making
 
06:17:09.190 --> 06:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
the threat shall not have committed a
 
06:17:11.868 --> 06:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
criminal act that's the current
 
06:17:14.350 --> 06:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
statute so I guess I'm wondering how is
 
06:17:16.110 --> 06:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
this different if this is the current
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
law that allows precisely what you're
 
06:17:20.830 --> 06:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
proposing I understand you don't have
 
06:17:22.150 --> 06:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
the law in front of you and I'm Sor to
 
06:17:24.670 --> 06:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
you disadvantage but it sounds to me
 
06:17:27.468 --> 06:17:27.478 align:start position:0%
like it's already covered in law uh
 
06:17:29.230 --> 06:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I believe
 
06:17:31.350 --> 06:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
trespass Criminal Trespass is not
 
06:17:33.868 --> 06:17:33.878 align:start position:0%
covered by the statute so this is what
 
06:17:35.830 --> 06:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do to add it to the
 
06:17:38.030 --> 06:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
statute about criminal
 
06:17:41.310 --> 06:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
trespasses I I believe your question is
 
06:17:44.390 --> 06:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
fair we don't debate the wayt this is we
 
06:17:47.350 --> 06:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
we inquire understood wasn't quite
 
06:17:54.910 --> 06:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:54.920 --> 06:17:57.868 align:start position:0%
 
was

06:17:57.868 --> 06:17:57.878 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:17:59.910 --> 06:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
represent you're
 
06:18:03.708 --> 06:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
recognized Mr chairman um and thank you
 
06:18:06.910 --> 06:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
representative um is there a specific
 
06:18:13.788 --> 06:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:16.628 --> 06:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
solve well I heard uh thank you for the
 
06:18:18.390 --> 06:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
question um I've had a good number of
 
06:18:22.670 --> 06:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
folks coming to me looking at 2020 as
 
06:18:25.430 --> 06:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
being somewhat of an unusual year with
 
06:18:25.440 --> 06:18:26.830 align:start position:0%
being somewhat of an unusual year with
riots

06:18:26.830 --> 06:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
riots
 
06:18:30.628 --> 06:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
violence dozens of people dying a fire
 
06:18:32.910 --> 06:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
bombing businesses destroyed homes
 
06:18:35.788 --> 06:18:35.798 align:start position:0%
destroyed lives ruined the summer of
 
06:18:38.510 --> 06:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
2020 so those folks are worried here in
 
06:18:38.520 --> 06:18:39.190 align:start position:0%
2020 so those folks are worried here in
New

06:18:39.190 --> 06:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
New
 
06:18:41.868 --> 06:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um they want to be able to
 
06:18:43.910 --> 06:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
protect themselves they want to be able
 
06:18:46.868 --> 06:18:46.878 align:start position:0%
to not be faced with violence
 
06:18:46.878 --> 06:18:48.548 align:start position:0%
to not be faced with violence
unnecessary

06:18:48.548 --> 06:18:48.558 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
06:18:51.948 --> 06:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
violence and this is what I'm doing here
 
06:18:54.788 --> 06:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh even in New Hampshire last summer I
 
06:18:55.868 --> 06:18:55.878 align:start position:0%
believe they were small business
 
06:18:58.868 --> 06:18:58.878 align:start position:0%
businesses that were quite in fear of
 
06:19:00.670 --> 06:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
being attacked when there were
 
06:19:02.548 --> 06:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
demonstrations throughout the
 
06:19:07.230 --> 06:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
cities so in in those cases we had uh
 
06:19:09.350 --> 06:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
owners to owners basically stand in
 
06:19:11.070 --> 06:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
front of the businesses trying to warn
 
06:19:13.948 --> 06:19:13.958 align:start position:0%
all the attackers uh that works I
 
06:19:17.350 --> 06:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
believe that's a great defensive uh
 
06:19:19.590 --> 06:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
display of
 
06:19:22.990 --> 06:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
firearms and this this
 
06:19:26.190 --> 06:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
law uh makes the people who scared of
 
06:19:29.990 --> 06:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
being attacked again uh not fear for the
 
06:19:31.350 --> 06:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
attack as much because they know that
 
06:19:33.868 --> 06:19:33.878 align:start position:0%
we're behind them 100% that we
 
06:19:36.230 --> 06:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
encourage the defensive display of
 
06:19:39.510 --> 06:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
firearm where there's a need and they
 
06:19:42.430 --> 06:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
feel they do not feel threatened anymore
 
06:19:45.910 --> 06:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
so I want to make it yeah so yeah that's
 
06:19:53.868 --> 06:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:56.430 --> 06:19:56.440 align:start position:0%

for taking my
 
06:20:49.948 --> 06:20:49.958 align:start position:0%
question if the STS and other
 
06:20:55.190 --> 06:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
places uh want to do this why would if
 
06:20:58.548 --> 06:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
no one had damaged their place why would
 
06:21:06.190 --> 06:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:08.788 --> 06:21:08.798 align:start position:0%

06:21:13.548 --> 06:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
question $1,500 is actually part of the
 
06:21:16.670 --> 06:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh trespassing chapter it's
 
06:21:19.590 --> 06:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
U that's how three trespass is defined

U that's how three trespass is defined
in

06:21:26.628 --> 06:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
63512 we're dealing with right uh that's
 
06:21:29.150 --> 06:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
a different
 
06:21:34.070 --> 06:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
yeah 63512 defines Criminal Trespass as
 
06:21:34.080 --> 06:21:35.670 align:start position:0%
yeah 63512 defines Criminal Trespass as
a

06:21:35.670 --> 06:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:21:40.510 --> 06:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh the minute or class B
 
06:21:43.190 --> 06:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
felony uh speak subsequent
 
06:21:45.590 --> 06:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
offense if the person recklessly causes
 
06:21:48.190 --> 06:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
damage in the excess of
 
06:21:51.390 --> 06:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
$1,500 um since this new chapter makes
 
06:21:54.270 --> 06:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
it an exception um to the chapter about
 
06:21:56.230 --> 06:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
Criminal Trespass we just using that
 
06:21:58.750 --> 06:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
same dollar amount that the criminal
 
06:22:03.670 --> 06:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
uses to delineate felony closby
 
06:22:11.430 --> 06:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:14.788 --> 06:22:14.798 align:start position:0%
you representative Newman you
 
06:22:16.788 --> 06:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair and thank

question I are you aware um are you
 
06:22:24.990 --> 06:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
aware that the uh the way the bill is
 
06:22:28.868 --> 06:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
worded at least in my opinion is that it
 
06:22:31.948 --> 06:22:31.958 align:start position:0%
uh expands the ability to display a
 
06:22:35.830 --> 06:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
weapon to all forms of Criminal Trespass
 
06:22:38.070 --> 06:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
where the current law protects a certain
 
06:22:44.190 --> 06:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:54.468 --> 06:22:54.478 align:start position:0%

me
it

06:22:58.708 --> 06:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:01.868 --> 06:23:01.878 align:start position:0%
U you're able to display
 
06:23:07.230 --> 06:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:09.788 --> 06:23:09.798 align:start position:0%
trespassing with a
 
06:23:17.548 --> 06:23:17.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:24.468 --> 06:23:24.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:27.070 --> 06:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
sorry experiment

followup represent Newman you recognized
 
06:23:31.628 --> 06:23:31.638 align:start position:0%
for a followup
 
06:23:34.990 --> 06:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
question yes yes thank you Mr chair and
 
06:23:37.910 --> 06:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
um do you agree that since it says the
 
06:23:40.628 --> 06:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
entire the law of section four in its
 
06:23:43.190 --> 06:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
entirety that that covers all of the
 
06:23:45.270 --> 06:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
definitions of criminal trespassing in
 
06:23:45.280 --> 06:23:54.390 align:start position:0%
definitions of criminal trespassing in
that

06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:54.400 --> 06:24:10.670 align:start position:0%
 
law

06:24:10.670 --> 06:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:14.628 --> 06:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh I would yeah I would agree yes yes
 
06:24:16.468 --> 06:24:16.478 align:start position:0%
Criminal Trespass yes that's what we're
 
06:24:24.350 --> 06:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:27.270 --> 06:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
you repres representative Wallace you
 
06:24:29.110 --> 06:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
recognize thank you Mr chairman and
 
06:24:30.628 --> 06:24:30.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
06:24:33.430 --> 06:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
question so this bill will provide legal
 
06:24:35.628 --> 06:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
protection uh to a property owner who is
 
06:24:37.830 --> 06:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
taking a defensive posture with a
 
06:24:40.390 --> 06:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
firearm or another means of self-defense
 
06:24:42.468 --> 06:24:42.478 align:start position:0%
to neutralize or deescalate to threat in
 
06:24:44.548 --> 06:24:44.558 align:start position:0%
a criminal trespassing situation is that
 
06:24:46.788 --> 06:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that correct uh yes
 
06:24:52.270 --> 06:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:55.868 --> 06:24:55.878 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:25:00.788 --> 06:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question um when I look at
 
06:25:03.430 --> 06:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
6314 um that is for certain government
 
06:25:05.948 --> 06:25:05.958 align:start position:0%
officials and you're
 
06:25:10.310 --> 06:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:14.468 --> 06:25:14.478 align:start position:0%
asking so are you adding um a new
 
06:25:20.830 --> 06:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:24.270 --> 06:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
officials I think wrong
 
06:25:24.280 --> 06:25:25.868 align:start position:0%
officials I think wrong
yeah

06:25:25.868 --> 06:25:25.878 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:25:28.468 --> 06:25:28.478 align:start position:0%
that's it says criminal threatening
 
06:25:31.310 --> 06:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
amend RSA
 
06:25:35.708 --> 06:25:35.718 align:start position:0%
6314 that's did I so he's adding four
 
06:25:37.788 --> 06:25:37.798 align:start position:0%
because it only goes to
 
06:25:43.110 --> 06:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
three go four mine's don't in this
 
06:25:49.310 --> 06:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:52.230 --> 06:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
different oh

06:26:56.030 --> 06:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
him
 
06:27:00.910 --> 06:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:02.830 --> 06:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
handon good afternoon members of the
 
06:27:05.030 --> 06:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee um nice to see you all again
 
06:27:06.510 --> 06:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
my name is Joe Hannah I'm the vice
 
06:27:08.190 --> 06:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
president for gun owners of New
 
06:27:10.910 --> 06:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm speaking in support of
 
06:27:10.920 --> 06:27:12.070 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm speaking in support of
HB

06:27:12.070 --> 06:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
HB
 
06:27:16.350 --> 06:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
196 um I I think uh there was one I
 
06:27:17.788 --> 06:27:17.798 align:start position:0%
forget who said it but there was
 
06:27:19.110 --> 06:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is a differ differ
 
06:27:21.110 --> 06:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
between between brandishing and
 
06:27:24.190 --> 06:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
displaying uh I I've just double checked
 
06:27:25.948 --> 06:27:25.958 align:start position:0%
I went through the the search there's no
 
06:27:27.868 --> 06:27:27.878 align:start position:0%
word brandishing in the rsas in New
 
06:27:29.948 --> 06:27:29.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire display is the only reference
 
06:27:32.230 --> 06:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
to to showing uh anything whether it's
 
06:27:34.868 --> 06:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
Firearms fireworks or whatever what may
 
06:27:36.628 --> 06:27:36.638 align:start position:0%
have you
 
06:27:39.390 --> 06:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
um there I think some of the confusion
 
06:27:42.150 --> 06:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
is that uh we're not allowed to use
 
06:27:45.750 --> 06:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
force in defense of premises or property
 
06:27:48.708 --> 06:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
and there is uh already in the law a
 
06:27:48.718 --> 06:27:50.670 align:start position:0%
and there is uh already in the law a
section

06:27:50.670 --> 06:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
section
 
06:27:53.430 --> 06:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
6277 use of force in defense of premises
 
06:27:55.070 --> 06:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
and a person in possession or control of
 
06:27:56.750 --> 06:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
premises or a person who is licensed or
 
06:27:58.990 --> 06:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
privileged to be thereon is Justified in
 
06:28:00.990 --> 06:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
using non-deadly Force upon another when
 
06:28:02.628 --> 06:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that he reason
 
06:28:04.030 --> 06:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
believes it is necessary to prevent or
 
06:28:05.788 --> 06:28:05.798 align:start position:0%
terminate the commission of a criminal
 
06:28:09.190 --> 06:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
trespass by such other in or upon such
 
06:28:11.190 --> 06:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
premises but he may use deadly force
 
06:28:13.030 --> 06:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
under s such circumstances only depends
 
06:28:15.190 --> 06:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
to the person is described under RSA
 
06:28:17.510 --> 06:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
6274 or when he reason believes it is
 
06:28:18.868 --> 06:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
necessary to prevent an attempt by the
 
06:28:21.150 --> 06:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
trespasser to commit arson so you can
 
06:28:23.190 --> 06:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
already use non-deadly Force so the
 
06:28:25.030 --> 06:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
display is certainly non-deadly Force
 
06:28:26.750 --> 06:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
course it doesn't authorize someone to
 
06:28:28.750 --> 06:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
actually use that weapon but it can be
 
06:28:31.510 --> 06:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
used as a warning so in conjunction with
 
06:28:33.590 --> 06:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
the other statutes about using a firearm
 
06:28:35.830 --> 06:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
to as a warning against serious bodily
 
06:28:38.510 --> 06:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
injury or death um I think that's almost
 
06:28:41.150 --> 06:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
a non-necessary part of the law because
 
06:28:42.670 --> 06:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
if someone's going to seriously injure
 
06:28:44.150 --> 06:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
you or kill you you have the right to
 
06:28:45.750 --> 06:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
not only show them your fire armor
 
06:28:47.548 --> 06:28:47.558 align:start position:0%
weapon but you have the right to to use
 
06:28:49.788 --> 06:28:49.798 align:start position:0%
it in defense of yourself so this
 
06:28:51.390 --> 06:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
actually makes everything much more
 
06:28:54.788 --> 06:28:54.798 align:start position:0%
clear and uh using non-deadly force in
 
06:28:54.798 --> 06:28:55.750 align:start position:0%
clear and uh using non-deadly force in
this

06:28:55.750 --> 06:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:28:59.750 --> 06:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill does coincide with Section
 
06:29:01.990 --> 06:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
6277 use of force and defense of
 
06:29:03.788 --> 06:29:03.798 align:start position:0%
premises so it is non- deadly force it's
 
06:29:06.310 --> 06:29:06.320 align:start position:0%

the courts will use the the standard
 
06:29:57.830 --> 06:29:57.840 align:start position:0%

minutes

06:30:41.708 --> 06:30:41.718 align:start position:0%
minutes

hello yes Mr rice we can hear you okay
 
06:30:47.868 --> 06:30:47.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um Allan rice uh Gun
 
06:30:48.910 --> 06:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
Owners of
 
06:30:53.310 --> 06:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
America um Mr Hannon uh did a very good
 
06:30:55.270 --> 06:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
job explaining um
 
06:30:57.670 --> 06:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
the benefit to the bill um I just want
 
06:31:00.708 --> 06:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
to add in the questions about
 
06:31:03.310 --> 06:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
trespassing sometimes a trespass that
 
06:31:06.310 --> 06:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
starts out innocently enough becomes
 
06:31:09.430 --> 06:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
violent and the person owning the
 
06:31:11.628 --> 06:31:11.638 align:start position:0%
property should not face criminal
 
06:31:15.310 --> 06:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
prosecution for holding displaying any
 
06:31:17.510 --> 06:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
firearm um it's common to carry a
 
06:31:20.150 --> 06:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
handgun and a holster but a rifle would
 
06:31:22.548 --> 06:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
be on a sling on a shoulder a shotgun
 
06:31:25.510 --> 06:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
may just be cradled across the arms
 
06:31:27.948 --> 06:31:27.958 align:start position:0%
and you know defensive display as we
 
06:31:29.830 --> 06:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
talked about in a prior Bill a few weeks
 
06:31:33.270 --> 06:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
ago is a very valid uh self-defense
 
06:31:35.388 --> 06:31:35.398 align:start position:0%
concept um so I just want to put Gun
 
06:31:37.388 --> 06:31:37.398 align:start position:0%
Owners of America on record in support
 
06:31:39.830 --> 06:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill keep it under two minutes
 
06:31:47.430 --> 06:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:49.350 --> 06:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr rice for your
 
06:31:50.990 --> 06:31:51.000 align:start position:0%

recognized for a question uh thank you
 
06:31:57.230 --> 06:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh what is your your take on uh
 
06:31:59.388 --> 06:31:59.398 align:start position:0%
the part of the bill that says likely to
 
06:32:03.628 --> 06:32:03.638 align:start position:0%
cause property damage in excess of
 
06:32:05.990 --> 06:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
$1,500 how's that going to play out in
 
06:32:07.670 --> 06:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
court well
 
06:32:09.910 --> 06:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
$1,500 um thank you for your question
 
06:32:12.468 --> 06:32:12.478 align:start position:0%
representative Hopper
 
06:32:15.468 --> 06:32:15.478 align:start position:0%
$1,500 is the threshold in New Hampshire
 
06:32:18.070 --> 06:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
when vandalism of private property
 
06:32:23.628 --> 06:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:23.638 --> 06:32:29.770 align:start position:0%
 
felony

06:32:29.770 --> 06:32:29.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:29.780 --> 06:32:34.468 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:32:34.468 --> 06:32:34.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:36.990 --> 06:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands raised I want to
 
06:32:41.750 --> 06:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:49.190 --> 06:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:52.190 --> 06:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you Mr chair um this is the
 
06:32:54.990 --> 06:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
state representative Maria Perez and I'm
 
06:32:56.670 --> 06:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
testifying against this
 
06:32:59.430 --> 06:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill uh we don't need any more bills
 
06:33:01.990 --> 06:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
that is going to give people a right to
 
06:33:05.510 --> 06:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
um even though that people sometimes
 
06:33:08.150 --> 06:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
like me and myself sometimes just walk
 
06:33:11.110 --> 06:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
around the neighborhood and this this
 
06:33:14.270 --> 06:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
kind of build doesn't make me feel safe
 
06:33:16.548 --> 06:33:16.558 align:start position:0%
because sometime people just uh
 
06:33:18.868 --> 06:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
discriminate just because they don't
 
06:33:20.708 --> 06:33:20.718 align:start position:0%
like the way you look they don't like
 
06:33:22.708 --> 06:33:22.718 align:start position:0%
the way you talk or they they just
 
06:33:25.510 --> 06:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
barely or they just don't like you and
 
06:33:27.590 --> 06:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
this is given people the chance
 
06:33:30.590 --> 06:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
to give them the right to uh show their
 
06:33:33.150 --> 06:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
guns and then try to threatening you
 
06:33:35.510 --> 06:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
with the guns and the other thing
 
06:33:39.590 --> 06:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
is myself myself I I I have people
 
06:33:42.590 --> 06:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
trespassing my house many times my
 
06:33:45.468 --> 06:33:45.478 align:start position:0%
property one of the occasions someone
 
06:33:47.350 --> 06:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
trespassing my property and asked for my
 
06:33:49.910 --> 06:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
husband and this person had the
 
06:33:52.430 --> 06:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
intention of arguing with my husband and
 
06:33:54.628 --> 06:33:54.638 align:start position:0%
getting into a fight with my husband and
 
06:33:57.948 --> 06:33:57.958 align:start position:0%
I say no and this person pushed me on my
 
06:33:57.958 --> 06:33:58.788 align:start position:0%
I say no and this person pushed me on my
own

06:33:58.788 --> 06:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
own
 
06:34:01.830 --> 06:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
driveway but personally I didn't respond
 
06:34:03.468 --> 06:34:03.478 align:start position:0%
to that
 
06:34:07.030 --> 06:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
because um if you know yes I'm a US
 
06:34:09.830 --> 06:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
citizen but I'm an immigrant and the L
 
06:34:12.830 --> 06:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh threaten us differently because even
 
06:34:15.150 --> 06:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
we US citizens we don't have the same
 
06:34:17.230 --> 06:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
protection in someone who who was born
 
06:34:21.948 --> 06:34:21.958 align:start position:0%
in here so I believe this law uh I will
 
06:34:24.310 --> 06:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
I will not support this 196 because it's
 
06:34:26.868 --> 06:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
not not given any protections for people
 
06:34:28.708 --> 06:34:28.718 align:start position:0%
from the minority groups when it comes
 
06:34:31.590 --> 06:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
to like uh try to protect them and
 
06:34:33.590 --> 06:34:33.600 align:start position:0%

their hand was not up I did ask on mute

me yes we can hear just fine thank you I
 
06:35:57.150 --> 06:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
I am testifying on behalf of myself as
 
06:35:58.670 --> 06:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
well as the New Hampshire Firearms
 
06:36:00.548 --> 06:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
Coalition um I serve on the board of
 
06:36:03.708 --> 06:36:03.718 align:start position:0%
directors as um the corporate secretary
 
06:36:06.468 --> 06:36:06.478 align:start position:0%
we are in support of the bill as filed
 
06:36:08.510 --> 06:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
um and we agree with the testimony of
 
06:36:10.468 --> 06:36:10.478 align:start position:0%
both Gun Owners of America as well as
 
06:36:11.750 --> 06:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
gun owners of New
 
06:36:14.270 --> 06:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think at a high level no
 
06:36:17.388 --> 06:36:17.398 align:start position:0%
one should be penalized for um simply
 
06:36:19.430 --> 06:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
displaying a firearm that should not be
 
06:36:21.150 --> 06:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
considered a crime and criminal
 
06:36:23.190 --> 06:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
threatening is already well defined in
 
06:36:27.910 --> 06:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 63 one in terms of Acts and behavior
 
06:36:31.110 --> 06:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
and just merely holding a firearm or in
 
06:36:34.670 --> 06:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
the case of uh Mr rice pointed out right
 
06:36:37.150 --> 06:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
carrying a shotgun around potentially
 
06:36:38.990 --> 06:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
with both hands if you're walking on
 
06:36:41.430 --> 06:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
your property shouldn't be considered a
 
06:36:43.510 --> 06:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
crime by itself the crime is the
 
06:36:45.388 --> 06:36:45.398 align:start position:0%
threatening part and that's already well
 
06:36:47.670 --> 06:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
defined in statute so I would ask that
 
06:36:49.230 --> 06:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
you would support the bill as is if
 
06:36:50.670 --> 06:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
there's questions I will gladly take
 
06:36:53.190 --> 06:36:53.200 align:start position:0%

also can I make note of two people that
 
06:39:18.388 --> 06:39:18.398 align:start position:0%
are or two organizations that oppos the
 
06:39:20.270 --> 06:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
bill would that be
 
06:39:24.708 --> 06:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
okay we're not any no formal hearing so
 
06:39:26.868 --> 06:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
okay New Hampshire legal assistance and
 
06:39:28.670 --> 06:39:28.680 align:start position:0%

06:39:38.670 --> 06:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
Violence and a slew of other people but
 
06:39:40.948 --> 06:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
I thought it was worth noting some of
 
06:39:42.830 --> 06:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
the groups that we're consistently
 
06:39:42.840 --> 06:39:49.750 align:start position:0%
the groups that we're consistently
hearing

06:39:49.750 --> 06:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:52.948 --> 06:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
from I ask questions see we're not doing
 
06:39:52.958 --> 06:39:56.030 align:start position:0%
from I ask questions see we're not doing
anything

06:39:56.030 --> 06:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:00.708 --> 06:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
specifically May so so company comes on
 
06:40:04.030 --> 06:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
to my property I live out in out in way
 
06:40:06.510 --> 06:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
out in the woods somebody coming on my
 
06:40:09.350 --> 06:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
property pretty deliberate it's not like
 
06:40:12.628 --> 06:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
wandering off the street on my prop and
 
06:40:14.990 --> 06:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
I walk out of my house with a shotgun
 
06:40:16.628 --> 06:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
because I have no idea what the hell
 
06:40:19.468 --> 06:40:19.478 align:start position:0%
they're doing I also don't know that
 
06:40:21.788 --> 06:40:21.798 align:start position:0%
they're going to actually do any damage
 
06:40:24.350 --> 06:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
if this log goes through am I now guilty
 
06:40:26.270 --> 06:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
of brandishing a
 
06:40:28.830 --> 06:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
firearm I mean in where I think I can
 
06:40:30.948 --> 06:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
bury the evidence pretty successfully
 
06:40:33.430 --> 06:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
but let's just understand the term
 
06:40:36.070 --> 06:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
brandishing is
 
06:40:39.030 --> 06:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
display yeah use the terms differ
 
06:40:40.750 --> 06:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
brandishing is Define in the federal
 
06:40:42.830 --> 06:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay anyway I'm displaying my firearms
 
06:40:43.948 --> 06:40:43.958 align:start position:0%
I'm proud of
 
06:40:46.910 --> 06:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
it and trying to encourage them to leave
 
06:40:46.920 --> 06:40:49.310 align:start position:0%
it and trying to encourage them to leave
the

06:40:49.310 --> 06:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:52.628 --> 06:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
property is if this pass like right now
 
06:40:55.270 --> 06:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
what would happen versus if this passes
 
06:40:58.510 --> 06:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
what will happen in my opinion and this
 
06:41:00.430 --> 06:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
is just my opinion I I don't feel that
 
06:41:01.990 --> 06:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
this the mere Act of displaying a
 
06:41:03.388 --> 06:41:03.398 align:start position:0%
firearm in the state of New Hampshire is
 
06:41:06.910 --> 06:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
a crime under any circumstance under the
 
06:41:08.990 --> 06:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
federal definition what makes it
 
06:41:11.030 --> 06:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
brandishing is that when you when you
 
06:41:13.070 --> 06:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
display the firearm with the specific
 
06:41:16.948 --> 06:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
intent to to intimidate or threaten
 
06:41:19.670 --> 06:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
someone so that's what makes brandishing
 
06:41:21.628 --> 06:41:21.638 align:start position:0%
it requires displaying but it requires
 
06:41:23.628 --> 06:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
an additional Acts or intent to do
 
06:41:23.638 --> 06:41:24.388 align:start position:0%
an additional Acts or intent to do
something

06:41:24.388 --> 06:41:24.398 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:41:25.868 --> 06:41:25.878 align:start position:0%
so if you were simply just walking down
 
06:41:28.190 --> 06:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
the street open caring in New Hampshire
 
06:41:31.070 --> 06:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
which is been the law as long as I can
 
06:41:35.468 --> 06:41:35.478 align:start position:0%
remember that is only considered
 
06:41:38.548 --> 06:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
display now I would I would also say
 
06:41:40.708 --> 06:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
that if you were to take your firearm
 
06:41:43.350 --> 06:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
and pointed at any individual or even
 
06:41:45.070 --> 06:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
unless is for a lawful reason to defend
 
06:41:47.388 --> 06:41:47.398 align:start position:0%
yourself I don't feel you can simply say
 
06:41:49.350 --> 06:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
I am just displaying a firearm when I
 
06:41:50.948 --> 06:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
when it's that fire being pointed at
 
06:41:53.110 --> 06:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
person no I would never do that unless
 
06:41:55.190 --> 06:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
they they were actually threatening me
 
06:41:57.868 --> 06:41:57.878 align:start position:0%
I'm talking somebody's on my property I
 
06:42:00.030 --> 06:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what they're doing I walk out
 
06:42:03.708 --> 06:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
of the house with my shotgun am I
 
06:42:06.388 --> 06:42:06.398 align:start position:0%
guilty I don't know what I they might be
 
06:42:11.670 --> 06:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
doing $100 damage you property Potion No
 
06:42:13.150 --> 06:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
long as you don't point it at him you're
 
06:42:13.160 --> 06:42:15.070 align:start position:0%
long as you don't point it at him you're
not

06:42:15.070 --> 06:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:42:17.548 --> 06:42:17.558 align:start position:0%
guilty I think I understand what you're
 
06:42:20.190 --> 06:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
saying dollar amount be a concern the
 
06:42:22.430 --> 06:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts just screwed me up well
 
06:42:25.030 --> 06:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
we can do represent is I know there's
 
06:42:27.910 --> 06:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
two executive sessions that we can get
 
06:42:27.920 --> 06:42:28.750 align:start position:0%
two executive sessions that we can get
moving

06:42:28.750 --> 06:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
moving
 
06:42:31.948 --> 06:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
on but I think this is something that we
 
06:42:34.150 --> 06:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
um maybe have a further conversation on
 
06:42:36.070 --> 06:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
the committee in in the executive
 
06:42:38.510 --> 06:42:38.520 align:start position:0%

defense if I get caught

confused and
 
06:43:48.468 --> 06:43:48.478 align:start position:0%
bolded on the 18 months uh serving

06:43:58.510 --> 06:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
18 months before two3 of six years
 
06:44:00.990 --> 06:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
probably is not going to give you enough
 
06:44:04.430 --> 06:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
time to complete any programs that you
 
06:44:05.990 --> 06:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
may or may not
 
06:44:06.000 --> 06:44:07.670 align:start position:0%
may or may not
need

06:44:07.670 --> 06:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
need
 
06:44:11.310 --> 06:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
um I have questions on the bill that
 
06:44:13.388 --> 06:44:13.398 align:start position:0%
perhaps they might get answered if you
 
06:44:20.670 --> 06:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:24.948 --> 06:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
chair m recogniz
 
06:44:27.788 --> 06:44:27.798 align:start position:0%
yes just a reminder that this was a bill
 
06:44:30.948 --> 06:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
that we passed um 20 to nothing uh in
 
06:44:33.868 --> 06:44:33.878 align:start position:0%
the previous session uh and the only
 
06:44:35.670 --> 06:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
thing that has really changed
 
06:44:37.708 --> 06:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
substantially in the bill uh is
 
06:44:39.150 --> 06:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
something that caused the New Hampshire
 
06:44:41.750 --> 06:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections uh to endorse
 
06:44:43.948 --> 06:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
it uh we also have endorsements of the
 
06:44:45.070 --> 06:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
bill from the
 
06:44:48.030 --> 06:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
ACLU uh and the uh New Hampshire
 
06:44:50.150 --> 06:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
Association of criminal defense lawyers
 
06:44:54.510 --> 06:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
I mean this is a pretty good bill and I
 
06:44:56.868 --> 06:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
know sometimes uh when you look at these
 
06:44:58.430 --> 06:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
things the first time they can be a
 
06:45:00.910 --> 06:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
little confusing but I think part of our
 
06:45:02.788 --> 06:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
job is to sort of sort through some of
 
06:45:05.430 --> 06:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
the confusion uh not just
 
06:45:09.388 --> 06:45:09.398 align:start position:0%
to defer confusion until September or
 
06:45:12.910 --> 06:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
October when we can get around with it I
 
06:45:15.388 --> 06:45:15.398 align:start position:0%
we're not doing you know based on some
 
06:45:17.190 --> 06:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
of our other votes you know we we
 
06:45:20.270 --> 06:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
haven't done uh a great deal for people
 
06:45:22.750 --> 06:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
who are uh who are incarcerated I think
 
06:45:25.510 --> 06:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
everybody acknowled knowes that there
 
06:45:29.310 --> 06:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
you know we have issues uh in our in our
 
06:45:33.110 --> 06:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
prison system with um allowing too many
 
06:45:36.030 --> 06:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
people um uh to be incarcerated beyond
 
06:45:38.948 --> 06:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
the time they probably should be um this
 
06:45:41.510 --> 06:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
is a bill that would help us address it
 
06:45:43.708 --> 06:45:43.718 align:start position:0%
in a in a very measured way it's not
 
06:45:46.030 --> 06:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
extreme uh it's not a get out of jail
 
06:45:50.468 --> 06:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
free card um uh all it essentially does
 
06:45:53.910 --> 06:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
is move up the time that somebody
 
06:46:00.070 --> 06:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:04.270 --> 06:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
um essentially to complete uh things
 
06:46:06.190 --> 06:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
that are required of them uh before
 
06:46:08.788 --> 06:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
their sentence could be suspended and
 
06:46:11.948 --> 06:46:11.958 align:start position:0%
you know I I'm having a hard time
 
06:46:13.948 --> 06:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
understanding what we need to change
 
06:46:16.190 --> 06:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
about it the the bill was actually
 
06:46:18.030 --> 06:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
changed that's what the amendment was
 
06:46:20.628 --> 06:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
about um in response to some of the
 
06:46:23.830 --> 06:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
concerns we had even last year so I'm
 
06:46:26.350 --> 06:46:26.360 align:start position:0%
sort of at a loss as to why the itl but
 
06:46:32.350 --> 06:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:34.548 --> 06:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
is although there's no Amendment offer
 
06:46:39.830 --> 06:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:42.270 --> 06:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
explaining that am were
 
06:46:44.750 --> 06:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
offered I'm sorry Mr chair I couldn't
 
06:46:46.270 --> 06:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
quite make your
 
06:46:48.868 --> 06:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
make was an amendment it's not offer but
 
06:46:51.910 --> 06:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
it just 205 can't offer to an
 
06:46:53.990 --> 06:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
itl offer
 
06:46:57.270 --> 06:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
I'm aware you are I'm aware that's why
 
06:46:57.280 --> 06:46:59.230 align:start position:0%
I'm aware you are I'm aware that's why
they

06:46:59.230 --> 06:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:47:02.030 --> 06:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
makeer I think the issue is that the
 
06:47:04.510 --> 06:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
folks in the prison system felt that the
 
06:47:07.270 --> 06:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
original 18 months that was in the bill
 
06:47:09.548 --> 06:47:09.558 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't give enough time for people
 
06:47:12.350 --> 06:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
who just qualify uh under the under the
 
06:47:15.190 --> 06:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
bill uh to be to be eligible for it it
 
06:47:16.788 --> 06:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't actually give them enough time
 
06:47:19.590 --> 06:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
to complete programs but when you reduce
 
06:47:22.190 --> 06:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
that to to 12 months it means that
 
06:47:24.548 --> 06:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
they're actually serving more time so
 
06:47:27.510 --> 06:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
that there's time uh to complete those
 
06:47:29.750 --> 06:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
additional programs so a lot of times
 
06:47:31.750 --> 06:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
when we look at 18 months to 12 months
 
06:47:34.150 --> 06:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
it seems like oh you know we're being
 
06:47:37.388 --> 06:47:37.398 align:start position:0%
more we're being more lenient um in in
 
06:47:39.310 --> 06:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
this partic particular case we're making
 
06:47:41.948 --> 06:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
it a little bit more difficult uh for
 
06:47:44.230 --> 06:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
people to do this who are eligible you
 
06:47:46.468 --> 06:47:46.478 align:start position:0%
know who might be eligible for this uh
 
06:47:49.708 --> 06:47:49.718 align:start position:0%
sooner so you know you know to me this
 
06:47:52.548 --> 06:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
seemed to be a a pretty good uh
 
06:47:59.510 --> 06:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:02.350 --> 06:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
through see no further hands raised the
 
06:48:04.510 --> 06:48:04.520 align:start position:0%

06:50:37.868 --> 06:50:37.878 align:start position:0%
think what we need to do is to determine
 
06:50:40.030 --> 06:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
is squ
 
06:50:40.040 --> 06:50:41.628 align:start position:0%
is squ
this

06:50:41.628 --> 06:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:50:44.670 --> 06:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
fund comes from where the where the
 
06:50:48.590 --> 06:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
money rate whether not tax funds some
 
06:50:48.600 --> 06:50:50.230 align:start position:0%
money rate whether not tax funds some
other

06:50:50.230 --> 06:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:50:57.548 --> 06:50:57.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:59.190 --> 06:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
I think we need to do that before it go
 
06:51:00.990 --> 06:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
to the floor
 
06:51:04.270 --> 06:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
so if we rain it we'll have a chance to
 
06:51:08.388 --> 06:51:08.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:11.628 --> 06:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
out representative Muse you
 
06:51:13.670 --> 06:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
recognized I I thought I heard in
 
06:51:18.350 --> 06:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh that there's no fiscal
 
06:51:20.910 --> 06:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
note on this bill because the money is
 
06:51:23.548 --> 06:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
coming from an established fund
 
06:51:25.948 --> 06:51:25.958 align:start position:0%
uh versus from the general fund or did I
 
06:51:27.910 --> 06:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
hear that
 
06:51:31.388 --> 06:51:31.398 align:start position:0%
wrong right I asked I asked the question
 
06:51:32.310 --> 06:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:51:36.190 --> 06:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
Witness believe representative bour Pro
 
06:51:40.510 --> 06:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
provided an answer that question
 
06:51:47.990 --> 06:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:50.590 --> 06:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
recollection yes chairman that is as it
 
06:51:53.708 --> 06:51:53.718 align:start position:0%
is the way what happened and uh
 
06:51:57.070 --> 06:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
I uh can't see any reason that we would
 
06:52:01.830 --> 06:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:04.510 --> 06:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
bill well that fund gets depleted at
 
06:52:06.270 --> 06:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
some point and the money has to come
 
06:52:08.788 --> 06:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
from somewhere to fill it up again corre
 
06:52:10.788 --> 06:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
we just need to determine where that
 
06:52:12.230 --> 06:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
money comes
 
06:52:17.788 --> 06:52:17.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:20.868 --> 06:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
recognize thank you um it comes from the
 
06:52:23.150 --> 06:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office it's online
 
06:52:26.388 --> 06:52:26.398 align:start position:0%
victims Compensation Program grants and
 
06:52:35.788 --> 06:52:35.798 align:start position:0%

Hampshire

06:52:45.150 --> 06:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:48.270 --> 06:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
thank represent P you
 
06:52:51.750 --> 06:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair it's my
 
06:52:54.590 --> 06:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
understanding they run out of money they
 
06:52:58.070 --> 06:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
run out of money nobody gets paid this
 
06:53:00.708 --> 06:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
is just a special fund for
 
06:53:07.628 --> 06:53:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:10.190 --> 06:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
you you're right I want to say that was
 
06:53:11.948 --> 06:53:11.958 align:start position:0%
my understanding too last year when we
 
06:53:14.670 --> 06:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
had all those different bills and it the
 
06:53:16.548 --> 06:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
money comes out of that fund when when
 
06:53:19.150 --> 06:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
it's gone it's gone at no point did
 
06:53:21.230 --> 06:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
anyone talk about going from the
 
06:53:23.548 --> 06:53:23.558 align:start position:0%
taxpayer or any of those types of
 
06:53:23.558 --> 06:53:25.430 align:start position:0%
taxpayer or any of those types of
things

06:53:25.430 --> 06:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:53:28.468 --> 06:53:28.478 align:start position:0%
so I think that we should be moving on
 
06:53:30.468 --> 06:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
with the bill uh there's no reason
 
06:53:33.670 --> 06:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:35.990 --> 06:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
it I will I will just let the members
 
06:53:37.948 --> 06:53:37.958 align:start position:0%
know we are meeting uh scheduled to meet
 
06:53:40.070 --> 06:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday and if it is retained and
 
06:53:41.830 --> 06:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
if anyone wants bring forward some
 
06:53:43.948 --> 06:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
information to present to the chair and
 
06:53:44.990 --> 06:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
vice chair of the committee or the
 
06:53:47.230 --> 06:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole as you can tell
 
06:53:48.990 --> 06:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
from today and other other days we've
