00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
okay why don't we get started here
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh the first one is the liquor
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
the liquor bill relative delinquent
 
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
payment of accounts by on-premise and
 
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
off-premise licensees
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
um so unfortunately we should have taken
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
this up last week but I
 
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
failed to put it down I failed to do it
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
and um so now we need to discuss it uh
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:09.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:23.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:23.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
Yeah so basically it raises the the
 
00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
dollar amount
 
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
uh the minimum dollar amount the law has
 
00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
been in on the books for a very very
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
and so raising it is pretty
 
00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:39.170 align:start position:0%
and so raising it is pretty
nominal

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
nominal
 
00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:41.459 align:start position:0%
um the commission has no problems with
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
with the higher dollar amount
 
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
I mean uh
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
give me that it is and it is an
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
interesting law it's in the idea that uh
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
because uh the commission requires when
 
00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
you file when the beer distributors
 
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
finally it has to uh report the sales of
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
beer and then and the and the collection
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
of the tax and so theoretically the your
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
distributor has to pay the tax to
 
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
commission and so uh the beer
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
distributors want to make sure that
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
they've actually been paid themselves
 
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh so we do have this law on
 
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
the books
 
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.110 align:start position:0%
the books
uh

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
but so but the dollar amount is de
 
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
minimis and some people who knows what
 
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
the reason why they haven't paid that
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
whatever that small amount of money so
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
the idea that that they have to be put
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
on the bad boy list and
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh seems uh a little ridiculous for just
 
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
100 bucks so
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:50.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
so who's here
 
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
oh my God because I know too sick is off
 
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.769 align:start position:0%
oh my God because I know too sick is off
foreign

00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%

Jason's here okay
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
so uh anybody want to make the motion
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
this is Executives next week
 
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
this bill this is just the subcommittee
 
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll I'll make the motion of uh
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
to pass okay
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:41.459 align:start position:0%
okay uh any discussion on the motion
 
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
about to pass
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor raise
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
your hand one two three
 
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.910 align:start position:0%
your hand one two three
no

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
or zip
 
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
Marvel how I do that okay
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
okay so this is the uh Secretary of
 
00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
State's uh housekeeping measure
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
let's see what if we have for the
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office
 
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
um and it's a myriad of different little
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
issues um
 
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.350 align:start position:0%
issues um
nothing

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
nothing is there any does anybody have
 
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
any questions in anything
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Ammon Cole
 
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
Thaxton hunt McAleer Herbert infilio
 
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.370 align:start position:0%
Thaxton hunt McAleer Herbert infilio
okay

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
anybody have any
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns seem like a pretty
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:44.899 align:start position:0%
and we're creating a whole new
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
Corporation type PBC
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
is that a new type or we
 
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:53.459 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
um Yes No actually that's we currently
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire uh public benefit
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
corporations however when someone
 
00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
designates themself as one they don't it
 
00:13:02.569 --> 00:13:02.579 align:start position:0%
does not indicate it in their title they
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
still list themselves as an ink or
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
Corporal limited someone has to look it
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
up to see so yeah so in Most states um
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
they allow them to to use that that
 
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
ending PBB like LLC but yeah that
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
basically tell us the public that they
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
are a public benefit Corporation
 
00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
um we have out-of-state companies that
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
register here that have that designation
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
and we can't allow them to register
 
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
under that name because we don't
 
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
recognize it in our statute so this
 
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
simply would just allow us to allow our
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
domestic benefit corporations that they
 
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:32.339 align:start position:0%
choose to use that as an a place of
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
incor Corp and foreign corporations who
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
register here who have that in their
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
name could you could register under that
 
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
that designation that's so it's really
 
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
um they will say more of just now is it
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
is it a charitable trust is it a
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
non-profit or is it a b Corp it's a b
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
Corp uh yeah be Infamous B Corp yeah
 
00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
Corp yeah correct yes this committee did
 
00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
this committee did pass B Corps uh many
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
years ago and it uh
 
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
it is I guess it's it's supposed to be a
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
allowing the corporation to be much more
 
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
uh in in taking care of the public and
 
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:19.740 align:start position:0%
warm fuzzies for the employees and it's
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
almost like an ESG Corporation right it
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
must be I I assume PBC it's probably
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
been let's get good ESG scores
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
um well if someone elected to become a
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
benefit Corporation they may or may not
 
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
choose to go through what they call the
 
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
B Corporation process where they set up
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
a very high rigid set of Standards to be
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
able to note themselves as a b Corp
 
00:14:41.329 --> 00:14:41.339 align:start position:0%
um but for example there are a few small
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
companies here in New Hampshire who just
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
make it a point to say that 10 of our
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
profits are going to go back into the
 
00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
community and and they don't have to
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
maximize their returns to the
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
shareholders they're allowed to there's
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
a portion of their of their of their
 
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
earnings directly back to
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
um Prof charitable
 
00:14:59.449 --> 00:14:59.459 align:start position:0%
um they provide a report once a year
 
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
that they post on our website at our on
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
their website and in our records this
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
indicate what they did with that with
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
six seven
 
00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:57.949 align:start position:0%
six seven
okay

00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
but we didn't do 64. and that's the
 
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
all right well we got a lot of people
 
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
for 64. so let's let's do that one oh no
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
we got somebody from the Department who
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
probably wants us to take care of her
 
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
bill first okay
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
all right we'll do 90 67 and then we'll
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
do 64 or so
 
00:16:58.199 --> 00:17:03.410 align:start position:0%
do 64 or so
okay

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
so wait to measure are you under
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
agriculture or or not labor right it
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
would always be why elevators were under
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
labor I never understood that one but
 
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.949 align:start position:0%
labor I never understood that one but
okay

00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
um and this is
 
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
again uh housekeeping right it didn't
 
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
say you requested it but I assumed this
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
was you guys requested this bill
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
you requested this bill
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.650 align:start position:0%
Okay so
pretty

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
any any questions from the committee
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
they're pretty good
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
all right anybody want to make the
 
00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:56.930 align:start position:0%
all right anybody want to make the
motion

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion see none
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
 
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
hand one two
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
I will try to do better I I know I'm
 
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:58.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative field
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
I would move on to pass on 64. since
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
this is establishes a study commission
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
after hearing the public testimony at
 
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
the the public hearing I actually worked
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
with OLS on trying to develop a
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
legislative solution and I've actually
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
literally taught the course on
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
legislative drafting at UNH law
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
and this is a head scratcher that there
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
is no easy legislative solution to this
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
one uh after working with the whole us
 
00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:27.860 align:start position:0%
and having
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
another attorney in the room we can't
 
00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
figure it out and I think that's the
 
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
quintessential time when you have a
 
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
study commission trying to figure out
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
where do we go from here on this type of
 
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.750 align:start position:0%
where do we go from here on this type of
problem

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
that this is only asking for a study
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
commission this is not actually getting
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
a legislative fix and given that we have
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
so many people in the room saying we
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
have a problem here we lose Nothing by
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
creating a study commission to take the
 
00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:57.380 align:start position:0%
next step forward of asking the question
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
where do we go from here it may be that
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
there is nowhere to go from here
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
but our job is to listen to our
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
constituents and our constituents are
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
saying we have a problem and now we need
 
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:15.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh okay representative Jackson
 
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.070 align:start position:0%
uh okay representative Jackson
well

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.390 align:start position:0%
well
I

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.190 align:start position:0%
I
disagree

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:28.100 align:start position:0%
this the the people who came before us
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
clearly have a remedy
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
in their home existing homeowners
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
associations agreements documents which
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
they signed when they put these
 
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
properties they don't like the results
 
00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:46.039 align:start position:0%
and I think it is
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to try and go into those
 
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
contractual agreements between the
 
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations and the people
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
who own these properties and try and
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
micromanage them there are they do have
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
other remedies the question here is they
 
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
have other remedies they've got plenty
 
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
of other remedies they don't like them
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
they don't want to hire an attorney to
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
defend their rights and the real reason
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
that I object to this is because it it
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
opens the door to a whole series of
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
other things in real estate where I
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
don't like the results of the facts so I
 
00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:27.539 align:start position:0%
want the state to come in
 
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
and modify it I don't like what I don't
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
like where my driveway is so I want
 
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.090 align:start position:0%
like where my driveway is so I want
somebody

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
bigger than my next door neighbor and me
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
to work that out at because I don't want
 
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
to hire an attorney or a surveyor there
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
are so many tens of thousands of issues
 
00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:48.539 align:start position:0%
like this in real estate that it is it's
 
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
a completely impractical to go it to go
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
into this that's my considered opinion
 
00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
okay representative McAleer uh thank you
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
uh I actually totally agree with with uh
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
Sean on this uh these people came to us
 
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
last year uh they they really are
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
desperate they don't
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
they really don't have the power or the
 
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
teeth in in some of these things and and
 
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
I I think it is at least worth a study
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
to see if we can find something that has
 
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
the teeth in it to uh to help solve
 
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
these people's problem they they really
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
don't have the power
 
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299 align:start position:0%
and uh if they had and whatever they
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
have they unfortunately don't know how
 
00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
to use it so uh we there's going to be a
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
solution out there and I I think we we
 
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
need to find it thank you
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just trying to look it up um
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
is there not
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
um an advisory or oversight board for
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
condo associations or something like
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
that there is there well would something
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
like that be um appropriate well I would
 
00:22:59.330 --> 00:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
say if if anything I'd say
 
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
tag it they're it
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
because I I don't really understand any
 
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
difference between these and a condo you
 
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:09.140 align:start position:0%
know a you know condo and a home
 
00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059 align:start position:0%
homeowners I'd like to hear it Sean so
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
to me is that if you were to say is that
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
just put this under that same body
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh you know that would I guess that
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
would make the most sense because to me
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
there's no difference what do you think
 
00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:24.470 align:start position:0%
there's no difference what do you think
Sean

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
Sean
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
I thought the same however going to OLS
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the same for a number of
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
technical reasons so my initial thought
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
was let's just Loop these into the
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
chapter on condos however if we did that
 
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
for a number of technical reasons which
 
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
were explained to me we would break the
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
condo statute
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
um which would lead to disastrous
 
00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:45.419 align:start position:0%
results for the state
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
so we would have to write a chapter a
 
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
mobile home chapter which is more work
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
than we can do uh on the Fly
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
the closest analogy actually is the
 
00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
co-op statute such as your Concord Co-op
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
down the road but that's an imperfect
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
analogy to try to Loop something like a
 
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
food co-op onto mobile homes so we don't
 
00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:09.539 align:start position:0%
have any Perfect Analogy to what these
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
actually are which is why we actually
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
need to create a chapter in the statutes
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
for what these are they're a weird
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
hybrid between condos and a co-op
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
but we don't have the perfect
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
legislative fix which is why we need a
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
study commission to try to figure out
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
what is this apple and orange that's
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's a pair but we don't have a pair
 
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
chapter right now in in the statutes but
 
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
if we retain the bill we could do the
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
we well we don't because this is a study
 
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
commission I know what I'm just saying
 
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
is that I'm just saying is if if if the
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
idea is we want to take what we've
 
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
already have in statute
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
and make it work for
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks
 
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
and I assume to be all all manufactured
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
housing Parks but I know that hb2
 
00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
these features hope so at this point I'm
 
00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:12.919 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
I I I I I I there's in my mind there's
 
00:25:18.409 --> 00:25:18.419 align:start position:0%
no difference between retaining a bill
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
and creating a study committee other
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
than that you've got Senators there
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
so uh where what was Senators bring
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
anything to the table or they even
 
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
whether they'll show up I don't know so
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
my thinking is that we're better off
 
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
just retaining and doing what you're
 
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
saying I mean I will we'll retain it and
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
I'll put you chair
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
figure something out what do you think
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
of that well I love being volunteers so
 
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
my Summer is gone now but I think no you
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it but the summer it's
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
you this doesn't start until September
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
but the speaker did say you could you
 
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
could uh once we we retain it that you
 
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
could begin work in June if you uh well
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
June it's they say he said you can do it
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
but then say it can't conflict with
 
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
Comedia conferences so forget that just
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
so it started in September and you have
 
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh you have two months to come up with
 
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
an answer well the problem is that this
 
00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:18.299 align:start position:0%
is it's writing a chapter of in the is
 
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
not two months of work this is
 
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.590 align:start position:0%
not two months of work this is
legitimately

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
legitimately
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
a true effort to create something that's
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
parallel to the condo statute is going
 
00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
to take two months and it's going to
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
take something that's beyond the
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
capacity of the limited resource of the
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
committee that we need to actually well
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
that no I'm saying it's the study
 
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't have any more there's
 
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
no more extra resources to do a study
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
committee can I Wallace assist with this
 
00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:42.299 align:start position:0%
what's that I mean OLS assist
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
OLS will need to assist because once you
 
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
draw something up you would take it to
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
them we're gonna we're gonna need to get
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
we're gonna need to get some heavy
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
lifting gear if we're creating something
 
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
analogous to the condo statute uh and
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
yeah that's assuming that the answer is
 
00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
something analogous to the condo statute
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
we could have
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
there could be something that is
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
existing that we use
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
the question is what the question is
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
what do we need
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
it's assuming that there is a
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
legislative fix it could be write a
 
00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.299 align:start position:0%
better contract
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
I think this is a great bill for you to
 
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
work on this fall great I really I think
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
retaining is the right idea
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
maybe I shouldn't okay
 
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.950 align:start position:0%
maybe I shouldn't okay
um

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
never mind I won't say that but I mean
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
just um and what representative Thaxton
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
say about you know they could hire an
 
00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
attorney a lot of people don't have
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
money to hire an attorney well this
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
can't doesn't hire any attorney I know
 
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying I'm with that
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
argument right you know um attorneys are
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
expensive they're like 700 an hour
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
yeah turn your mic on here you go the
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
do you understand what this thing is the
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
people who developed these Parks did not
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
have an exit strategy and the yes and
 
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
that Department of Agriculture came
 
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
along and said hey here we can do a good
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
thing for poor people
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
and so instead of having a owner you
 
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
we're going to help the owners get rid
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
of their white elephant the park and
 
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
we're going to finance this thing to all
 
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
of the owners and now whether you wanted
 
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
to be an owner or not
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
now you're a CO now you're a
 
00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
153rd share of Happy Town trailer park
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
and that we create a board to run it
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
which is your Association so I can see
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
Sean's point this is a this is a
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
Heffalump it's half elephant you know
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
half knot
 
00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:39.590 align:start position:0%
half knot
it

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
is there are remedies that were written
 
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
into all of those contracts for the
 
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
governing board
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
if you have a legitimate
 
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
CL well again back to the lawyer thing I
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
mean there's a lot of things you need
 
00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
lawyers for that people can't afford
 
00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:57.980 align:start position:0%
that's a common problem
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
uh but you know if you I I think if we
 
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
rather than kill the day with this thing
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
I would support Sean and on his
 
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and he's a lawyer
 
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:15.250 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and he's a lawyer
yeah

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:15.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
he'd make more money
 
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
so you know I'm happy to serve on that
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh I think you should as a be
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
in the real estate yeah and I'm familiar
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
with these we have several of them in
 
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:28.740 align:start position:0%
Cheshire County
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
personally I think every one of them was
 
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
an economic tragedy for the people who
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
bought who were forced into these things
 
00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
but it was a great deal if you owned
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
owned a trailer park that you didn't
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
know what to do with and you were 70
 
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
years old
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh and that's what most of all of them
 
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.510 align:start position:0%
uh and that's what most of all of them
are

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:29:47.169 --> 00:29:47.179 align:start position:0%
so yeah I'll deal with but I think
 
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
further from the perspective of today I
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
think it should be retained and sent off
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
to a subcommittee to study it we might
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
not come out with a perfect piece of
 
00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
legislation we might not come out but
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have a better idea what the
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:06.620 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:16.820 align:start position:0%
you did 100.
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
they could get mileage okay
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
representative Fila second by
 
00:30:26.529 --> 00:30:26.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh representative Yemen has yes a poor
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
discussion yes
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
I'm uh this is not my belly Wick so I I
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
would not like to serve on this
 
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but I just wanted to
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
comment that uh this bill creates this
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
study committee it has three
 
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
State reps and three Senators it goes
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
until November first this year so it's
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
only a few months anyway it's the same
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
timeline as if we retained it but we did
 
00:30:54.169 --> 00:30:54.179 align:start position:0%
hear from our constituents I just want
 
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that this bill was
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
heard in the Senate and all the
 
00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
interested parties came in and testified
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
and it was heard in this room we heard
 
00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
from all the interested parties uh so
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
you know we are making the best decision
 
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
based on the information that we've
 
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
received so
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
um I think retaining is uh makes the
 
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
most sense because we have
 
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
that information that we heard here and
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh any future information so
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
okay any more discussion on the motion
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
 
00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:32.570 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
hand

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
like representative spear you're not on
 
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.389 align:start position:0%
like representative spear you're not on
this

00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
this is a business we're 67. oh am I
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the wrong thing
 
00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:51.059 align:start position:0%
I'm she's sorry why are you here Carrie
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
for the mileage
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think you get mileage if you're
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
not supposed to be here didn't I see an
 
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.070 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
know and then and then I read and went
 
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
back through and and uh changed it
 
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.830 align:start position:0%
back through and and uh changed it
so

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.169 align:start position:0%
so
okay

00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
all right the motion passes six zip okay
 
00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:24.059 align:start position:0%
so business
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
Herbert

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
Herbert
 
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.450 align:start position:0%
Herbert
uh

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
I don't have Burrows
 
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
right right so I have Immaculate or
 
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
Herbert filo
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
spear okay and well I'll tell you what
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
one two three I'm just looking at what
 
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
was printed here and obviously it's
 
00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.970 align:start position:0%
was printed here and obviously it's
wrong

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh you can vote for Herbert
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
all right so Spear and then Herbert and
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
we'll have Burrows replaces okay
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
seven eight
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
is it really eight yeah there's eight
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
people on it okay the vote passes eight
 
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:34.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:43.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
let's look at the bill I know we had
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
trouble in the beginning and that's why
 
00:33:48.419 --> 00:33:57.350 align:start position:0%
trouble in the beginning and that's why
okay

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:01.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
no I said yeah
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.089 --> 00:34:16.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
you can you can how many how many did
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
you find studies on this
 
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
250 how to work on this thing
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to hear it since
 
00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem
 
00:34:34.379 --> 00:34:35.829 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem
right

00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
I'll keep it simple anyhow outside of
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
all the research I would move itl since
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
the state locks power of our federal
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
Bill anyhow
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
I'll second the motion
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
well the idea was if that
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
to convince the feds to
 
00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:19.690 align:start position:0%
to convince the feds to
to

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:19.700 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
do a waiver they needed some economic
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
evidence to do it we don't need a we
 
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
don't need a state study committee in
 
00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:29.579 align:start position:0%
the state Bill to do that we're
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly capable of sending a letter to
 
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
Senator Shaheen and Hassan anyhow so
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
well glad you bring that up because I
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
have big issues with resolutions
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
so what I've always said instead of
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
having a resolution
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
is that I would keep the bill alive
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
in committee so people would always say
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
is that we're we are considering
 
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.650 align:start position:0%
is that we're we are considering
something

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
but that if we but that uh so therefore
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
therefore when it when there's
 
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
documentation somewhere along the line
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
about what's going on in different
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
states like ncsl does report it'll say
 
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
that Commerce you know the New Hampshire
 
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
still has the bill
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
so that yeah we're we are conscious of
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
it and because I've always thought
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
resolutions are not worth the paper
 
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
they're printed on uh that in this way I
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
mean I would say over the years we would
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
have an issue I mean we started out way
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
back when
 
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
and um and the issue was uh Crow
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
Dickinson who was the State Rep and he
 
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
was a pro was up in your area yeah
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
Conway is he he's still around right is
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
he yeah he's the one who got arrested at
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
the airport yeah for having a gun in his
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
car in his bag yeah but anyway so Crow
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
the issue was that people from the main
 
00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
tax guys would come into the state and
 
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
audit uh appliance stores and and
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
businesses that were selling and seeing
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
whether they were uh not charging the
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
00:37:01.089 --> 00:37:01.099 align:start position:0%
and the issue was sales tax collection
 
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
and uh so obviously we were never going
 
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
to pass that bill I mean that's you know
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
there's a reciprocity but we always kept
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
the bill alive we always retained we
 
00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
always kept the bill alive so that he
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
could always say well you know we're
 
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
we're very concerned about this issue
 
00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
and then we're we have it and we're
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
worrying we're working on it but of
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
course now we have YouTube and they now
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
heard from my motives
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
but they'll never find us on YouTube
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
right well everything's on YouTube but
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
we could you could also equally say that
 
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
the Senate passed the bill by whatever
 
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
both the Senate passed the bill by
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
I suppose the other wisdom of retaining
 
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
this bill is who knows what happens we
 
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
put something under the floor of the
 
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.150 align:start position:0%
put something under the floor of the
house

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
so we would have another bite at it
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
anyways come you know next year in
 
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
October where we have to make it much
 
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.190 align:start position:0%
October where we have to make it much
decide

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
again what to do with it
 
00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.150 align:start position:0%
again what to do with it
so

00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
I have a I think the bill should be
 
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
retained and go into a pile that says it
 
00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
should never see the light of day and
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
the reason I say that is I actually did
 
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
the investigation to find out what the
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
impact of Jones Act was on our heating
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
bills and our electricity
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
and it turns out it's in the case of
 
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
heating bills there is no impact in the
 
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
case of uh electricity
 
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
it's if you compare it to some of the
 
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
other things and JP Morgan is big into
 
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
this investment and they did the
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
analysis and it's on the PA in the order
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
of one or two cents but the problem we
 
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
have is that right now the buyer for
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
electricity supply and demand for
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
natural gas is Europe and China and
 
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
they're paying two and three times the
 
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
price we pay as a result of that no
 
00:38:59.930 --> 00:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
supplier is going to sell to us if they
 
00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:02.339 align:start position:0%
can get more money overseas
 
00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:04.089 align:start position:0%
can get more money overseas
foreign

00:39:04.089 --> 00:39:04.099 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
settles out and who knows when that will
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
ever happen any analysis we do now is a
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
joke it is no validity at all so this
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
thing should be retained and on top of
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
that they wanted 250 000 of taxpayer
 
00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
money to investigate something that you
 
00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:23.339 align:start position:0%
can find out online
 
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
retain it so it never sees the light of
 
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.210 align:start position:0%
retain it so it never sees the light of
day

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:39:28.609 --> 00:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
if we put it out on the floor
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
there are people who will not have done
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
the investigation that I tried to do
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
and they will make snap judgments based
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
on whatever now you may not like the
 
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
Jones act because it is protectionist
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
fine you may like it because it is
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
protectionist fine but what impact did
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
it have on the cost of our yearly
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
heating nothing and so therefore it
 
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:54.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative spear second by
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative hunt moves to retain is
 
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:08.220 align:start position:0%

03:22:24.769 --> 03:22:24.779 align:start position:0%
appeared paired it out
 
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:50.030 --> 03:22:50.040 align:start position:0%

03:22:50.040 --> 03:22:53.450 align:start position:0%
all right next one
yes

03:22:53.450 --> 03:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:02.330 --> 03:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:04.370 --> 03:23:04.380 align:start position:0%

Burroughs

03:23:09.050 --> 03:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:09.060 --> 03:23:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:23:13.849 --> 03:23:13.859 align:start position:0%
uh next up Senate Bill 82 related to
 
03:23:18.769 --> 03:23:18.779 align:start position:0%

03:23:25.190 --> 03:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think this is really a bear that
 
03:23:31.309 --> 03:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:31.319 --> 03:23:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
because

03:23:40.670 --> 03:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:46.130 --> 03:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:48.110 --> 03:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
and there's there's so much going on
 
03:23:48.120 --> 03:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
and there's there's so much going on
here

03:23:52.070 --> 03:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:54.530 --> 03:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
03:23:56.809 --> 03:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
just just a comment
 
03:23:59.330 --> 03:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire bulletin they had a uh
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
report that said that Anthem owed 300
 
03:24:04.750 --> 03:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars on unpaid claims
 
03:24:07.849 --> 03:24:07.859 align:start position:0%
weeks long delays and hospitals were
 
03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
screaming and having all kinds of
 
03:24:12.229 --> 03:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
problems right so
 
03:24:14.030 --> 03:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
I I would assume the insurance
 
03:24:15.769 --> 03:24:15.779 align:start position:0%
department is going to be investigating
 
03:24:17.450 --> 03:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
this right I mean
 
03:24:19.670 --> 03:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
they're on top of it so I would say that
 
03:24:22.309 --> 03:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
we retain it we'll find out in September
 
03:24:27.290 --> 03:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:27.300 --> 03:24:29.450 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:24:31.729 --> 03:24:31.739 align:start position:0%

we change it and waiting to see what the
 
03:24:39.290 --> 03:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:41.870 --> 03:24:41.880 align:start position:0%

03:30:42.120 --> 03:30:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:30:44.870 --> 03:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:30:48.710 --> 03:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:51.170 --> 03:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
so representative hunt seconded by
 
03:30:55.729 --> 03:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:58.790 --> 03:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
moves ought to pass
 
03:31:01.849 --> 03:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion
 
03:31:05.990 --> 03:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:14.389 --> 03:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:14.399 --> 03:31:21.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:31:21.229 --> 03:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:22.849 --> 03:31:22.859 align:start position:0%
yeah what's wrong with those Senators
 
03:31:24.050 --> 03:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
they should be saying anything more
 
03:31:24.060 --> 03:31:28.370 align:start position:0%
they should be saying anything more
excited

03:31:28.370 --> 03:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
I think the next two are the next next
 
03:31:38.570 --> 03:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:38.580 --> 03:31:41.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:31:41.330 --> 03:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:44.090 --> 03:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
okay now we get to the middle
 
03:31:46.010 --> 03:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
whoever meets the road okay Senate Bill
 
03:31:47.450 --> 03:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
190 direct the insurance department to
 
03:31:49.670 --> 03:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
connect a cost study of providing
 
03:31:52.309 --> 03:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
coverage uh for certain reproductive
 
03:31:56.269 --> 03:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:58.490 --> 03:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
anybody want to weigh in
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:03.889 --> 03:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
although I'm not on the subcommittee I
 
03:32:06.050 --> 03:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
would urge my colleagues to make an
 
03:32:09.769 --> 03:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:13.250 --> 03:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
lgbtq couples are already paying for
 
03:32:16.010 --> 03:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
this benefit but are unable to access it
 
03:32:20.090 --> 03:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
because of the sex of their partner
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
therefore this is in effect
 
03:32:24.410 --> 03:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
discrimination on the basis of sex
 
03:32:26.450 --> 03:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
because they are unable to access a
 
03:32:28.790 --> 03:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
benefit for which they're paying simply
 
03:32:31.550 --> 03:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
due to the the sex of their partner
 
03:32:34.130 --> 03:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
this doesn't obligate the state to do
 
03:32:35.990 --> 03:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
anything it is simply asking the state
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
to study the economic impact if they
 
03:32:42.590 --> 03:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
were if we were to pass such a bill
 
03:32:44.450 --> 03:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
the type of legislation that we pass
 
03:32:47.330 --> 03:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
signals the type of values that we have
 
03:32:50.870 --> 03:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
as a state and particularly in the type
 
03:32:52.849 --> 03:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
of political climate that we have right
 
03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
now with so much anti-lgbtq violence and
 
03:32:58.870 --> 03:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
rhetoric happening across the country
 
03:33:01.969 --> 03:33:01.979 align:start position:0%
it's important that as a state we signal
 
03:33:05.389 --> 03:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
that we value lgbtq equality which I
 
03:33:08.410 --> 03:33:08.420 align:start position:0%
believe we do as a state
 
03:33:10.849 --> 03:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
enacting such a steady commission which
 
03:33:13.610 --> 03:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
costs us nothing which doesn't actually
 
03:33:15.769 --> 03:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
require us to provide this coverage but
 
03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
says that we wish to investigate such
 
03:33:18.000 --> 03:33:19.070 align:start position:0%
says that we wish to investigate such
coverage

03:33:19.070 --> 03:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
03:33:21.889 --> 03:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
is a powerful signal that we do value
 
03:33:24.110 --> 03:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
this type of equality and that we think
 
03:33:26.210 --> 03:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
that these couples should be able to
 
03:33:28.250 --> 03:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
start a family so I would urge my
 
03:33:29.950 --> 03:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues to
 
03:33:34.250 --> 03:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:34.260 --> 03:33:35.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:33:35.809 --> 03:33:35.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:33:41.750 --> 03:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:43.969 --> 03:33:43.979 align:start position:0%
I've given a lot of thought to it
 
03:33:46.910 --> 03:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
um and I do feel that this particular
 
03:33:49.070 --> 03:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
population should have the ability to at
 
03:33:51.110 --> 03:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
least have a rider we should be looking
 
03:33:53.570 --> 03:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
at and evaluating these options I feel
 
03:33:55.070 --> 03:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
that the commission would be a good way
 
03:33:58.729 --> 03:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:03.050 --> 03:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
03:34:07.490 --> 03:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
I agree completely with representative
 
03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
filio and again we're seeing this across
 
03:34:14.929 --> 03:34:14.939 align:start position:0%
the country and again this this is a
 
03:34:16.849 --> 03:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
statement I think if we fail to go
 
03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
forward with the cost study we are
 
03:34:20.630 --> 03:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
making a statement about our values and
 
03:34:22.070 --> 03:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
about how we
 
03:34:22.080 --> 03:34:22.790 align:start position:0%
about how we
um

03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:25.690 --> 03:34:25.700 align:start position:0%
how we respect or don't respect the LBG
 
03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
LBGTQ community so I'm in agreement with
 
03:34:31.610 --> 03:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:31.620 --> 03:34:32.929 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:34:32.929 --> 03:34:32.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:34:37.729 --> 03:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
Jeremy yes representative perhaps I'm
 
03:34:40.910 --> 03:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
the only one here who either remembers
 
03:34:42.729 --> 03:34:42.739 align:start position:0%
or didn't understand
 
03:34:46.750 --> 03:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
when we initially heard this bill in
 
03:34:50.450 --> 03:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
questioned uh one
 
03:34:52.670 --> 03:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
or heard from and I don't know whether
 
03:34:55.490 --> 03:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
we questioned or not uh with the
 
03:34:58.309 --> 03:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
individuals who spoke in response to a
 
03:35:01.010 --> 03:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
question about single individuals
 
03:35:04.190 --> 03:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
undergoing assisted reproduction care
 
03:35:07.610 --> 03:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
introduced the term socially infertile
 
03:35:10.370 --> 03:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering I I don't understand
 
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
what socially infertile means wondering
 
03:35:15.710 --> 03:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
if somebody can under explain to me what
 
03:35:19.729 --> 03:35:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:19.739 --> 03:35:20.929 align:start position:0%
 
somebody

03:35:20.929 --> 03:35:20.939 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
03:35:23.330 --> 03:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
do we have anyone here today
 
03:35:26.570 --> 03:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
um an expert who can because we don't
 
03:35:28.309 --> 03:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
need to you know representative Phelan
 
03:35:32.150 --> 03:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
I would actually defer to representative
 
03:35:37.750 --> 03:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
collaber who I think is a healthcare
 
03:35:40.610 --> 03:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
as a health care provider
 
03:35:40.620 --> 03:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
as a health care provider
um

03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:45.710 --> 03:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
when you place a situation of a couple
 
03:35:47.809 --> 03:35:47.819 align:start position:0%
that are not able to procreate in and
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
about themselves that is a social
 
03:35:52.370 --> 03:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
a social situation where they cannot
 
03:35:55.370 --> 03:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
they are infertile by virtue of that
 
03:35:56.809 --> 03:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
to women
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
two men
 
03:36:01.130 --> 03:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:03.710 --> 03:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
but what about individuals individuals
 
03:36:08.750 --> 03:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:10.969 --> 03:36:10.979 align:start position:0%
my understanding is they don't want to
 
03:36:12.950 --> 03:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
or maybe they are not comfortable having
 
03:36:14.870 --> 03:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
intercourse and this is their only way
 
03:36:16.429 --> 03:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to have children I've had
 
03:36:18.469 --> 03:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
women who were traumatized and that was
 
03:36:20.690 --> 03:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
how they chose to have kids
 
03:36:24.290 --> 03:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:24.300 --> 03:36:25.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:36:25.429 --> 03:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:36:27.530 --> 03:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:36:29.090 --> 03:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
I was waiting for everybody else to
 
03:36:30.889 --> 03:36:30.899 align:start position:0%
weigh in and then
 
03:36:35.269 --> 03:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
so we pass infertility mandate
 
03:36:37.910 --> 03:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
um but four years ago
 
03:36:41.570 --> 03:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
and when we passed it my memory was that
 
03:36:45.229 --> 03:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
it was a handful of States Massachusetts
 
03:36:47.090 --> 03:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
was the most famous of having
 
03:36:49.370 --> 03:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
infertility coverage but I would venture
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
to Guess that there are not more than
 
03:36:53.929 --> 03:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
four or five states total
 
03:36:59.030 --> 03:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:02.030 --> 03:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay number six
 
03:37:04.130 --> 03:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
no no no no no you don't understand this
 
03:37:05.769 --> 03:37:05.779 align:start position:0%
we already passed it
 
03:37:08.389 --> 03:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
infertility coverage
 
03:37:10.429 --> 03:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
03:37:13.729 --> 03:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
that is a health insurance mandate
 
03:37:15.469 --> 03:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
there are no writers when it comes to
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
health insurance because a writer is
 
03:37:19.969 --> 03:37:19.979 align:start position:0%
you're you end up paying for the whole
 
03:37:21.229 --> 03:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
class anyways because the only person
 
03:37:22.670 --> 03:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
who takes a writer is someone who's
 
03:37:25.250 --> 03:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
going to use the benefit so to forget
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
about writers what this committee deals
 
03:37:31.250 --> 03:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
with is health insurance mandates that
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
everybody is paying
 
03:37:35.750 --> 03:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
for this benefit
 
03:37:38.030 --> 03:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay even though we don't get it in
 
03:37:39.950 --> 03:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
other words the the most famous the
 
03:37:42.889 --> 03:37:42.899 align:start position:0%
original mandate was that uh insurance
 
03:37:45.530 --> 03:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
companies could not rate women higher
 
03:37:47.929 --> 03:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
than men
 
03:37:50.269 --> 03:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
even though most people said women have
 
03:37:50.279 --> 03:37:51.110 align:start position:0%
even though most people said women have
more

03:37:51.110 --> 03:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:37:54.349 --> 03:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
Health needs because they do May babies
 
03:37:57.950 --> 03:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
and that's but that everyone says is
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
that that was the very one of the Year
 
03:38:02.410 --> 03:38:02.420 align:start position:0%
first mandates okay
 
03:38:05.090 --> 03:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
mandates are have a cost
 
03:38:07.429 --> 03:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely to have a cost
 
03:38:11.210 --> 03:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
in terms of calculating that cost okay
 
03:38:14.210 --> 03:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
has to be some statistical
 
03:38:17.030 --> 03:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
calculations based upon who's going to
 
03:38:18.530 --> 03:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it how many are out
 
03:38:22.190 --> 03:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
there uh uh but in
 
03:38:25.250 --> 03:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
most cases I would say I've never had a
 
03:38:27.950 --> 03:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
mandate that said let's calculate how
 
03:38:29.389 --> 03:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
many people are actually going to take
 
03:38:32.870 --> 03:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of it it usually was what will
 
03:38:35.210 --> 03:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
be the cost of it
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay what is just the cost of of the
 
03:38:41.150 --> 03:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
Mandate okay so it's it's a very unusual
 
03:38:43.370 --> 03:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
circumstance so what I want to start
 
03:38:47.030 --> 03:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
with is just on the premises that
 
03:38:50.809 --> 03:38:50.819 align:start position:0%
if you're asking for equality
 
03:38:50.819 --> 03:38:52.250 align:start position:0%
if you're asking for equality
that

03:38:52.250 --> 03:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:38:55.429 --> 03:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
if a gay couple
 
03:38:55.439 --> 03:38:57.530 align:start position:0%
if a gay couple
if

03:38:57.530 --> 03:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:39:00.290 --> 03:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
they're infertile
 
03:39:02.150 --> 03:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
they still get the Mandate mandates
 
03:39:03.769 --> 03:39:03.779 align:start position:0%
available to them
 
03:39:07.010 --> 03:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:10.130 --> 03:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
right now the state law allows them so
 
03:39:14.450 --> 03:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
we're not treating anybody differently
 
03:39:18.650 --> 03:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:20.870 --> 03:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do your middle steps
 
03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
it has to do with whether you are
 
03:39:24.060 --> 03:39:26.269 align:start position:0%
it has to do with whether you are
infertile

03:39:26.269 --> 03:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
infertile
 
03:39:26.279 --> 03:39:27.650 align:start position:0%
infertile
period

03:39:27.650 --> 03:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:39:33.170 --> 03:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
theoretically they can get the coverage
 
03:39:36.530 --> 03:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
because the Mandate the infer the
 
03:39:38.750 --> 03:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
infertility mandate coverage doesn't say
 
03:39:41.929 --> 03:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
anything about marital status
 
03:39:44.929 --> 03:39:44.939 align:start position:0%
so they're already covered
 
03:39:50.210 --> 03:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
as long as they are infertile you are
 
03:39:52.130 --> 03:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
changing this legislation
 
03:39:55.130 --> 03:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
from not infertile
 
03:39:58.690 --> 03:39:58.700 align:start position:0%
you're basically saying anybody
 
03:40:01.250 --> 03:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
regardless of their
 
03:40:05.450 --> 03:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
marital sets right should be allowed
 
03:40:09.170 --> 03:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
to get infertility coverage
 
03:40:11.809 --> 03:40:11.819 align:start position:0%
representative to some extent that
 
03:40:15.050 --> 03:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
aligns the question that K couples or
 
03:40:18.170 --> 03:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
lgbtq couples are inherently infertile
 
03:40:21.590 --> 03:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
because no matter how intimate they are
 
03:40:25.929 --> 03:40:25.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:28.370 --> 03:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the actual biological
 
03:40:30.410 --> 03:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
the two people I mean I would I would
 
03:40:31.849 --> 03:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
say is
 
03:40:34.729 --> 03:40:34.739 align:start position:0%
um not that I'm a scientists but the
 
03:40:39.229 --> 03:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
idea of two Y chromosomes okay somewhere
 
03:40:41.150 --> 03:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
else you got to go get the X chromosome
 
03:40:43.729 --> 03:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
to be in there right somewhere again I'm
 
03:40:45.229 --> 03:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
naive to this
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
but somehow you're still going to have
 
03:40:49.790 --> 03:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
to get that from somewhere else that is
 
03:40:51.769 --> 03:40:51.779 align:start position:0%
what is true
 
03:40:55.849 --> 03:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
under our mandate that we have in
 
03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
fertility coverage that whatever that
 
03:41:00.889 --> 03:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
person is missing
 
03:41:03.349 --> 03:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
the infertility is going to go find it
 
03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and it'll be part of the
 
03:41:08.510 --> 03:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
process of the in vitro however neither
 
03:41:11.090 --> 03:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
partner is literally infertile that's
 
03:41:13.250 --> 03:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
that's the problem here
 
03:41:16.010 --> 03:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
unless one of the partners literally was
 
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
infertile which is unlikely to be the
 
03:41:19.969 --> 03:41:19.979 align:start position:0%
case in any circumstance
 
03:41:22.190 --> 03:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
so in all due respect
 
03:41:25.849 --> 03:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
is that um I think this is actually even
 
03:41:27.110 --> 03:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
though you're saying you're looking at
 
03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
is showing respect to these people who
 
03:41:32.210 --> 03:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
are obviously you know that that there's
 
03:41:35.630 --> 03:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
a momentum across this country but I
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
would say is that is dangerous because
 
03:41:39.410 --> 03:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
you're actually doing exactly what those
 
03:41:41.690 --> 03:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
people who are afraid of which is is
 
03:41:45.910 --> 03:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:48.650 --> 03:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
dispensation you're taking infertility
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
and say we don't care whether you're
 
03:41:52.429 --> 03:41:52.439 align:start position:0%
infertile we're going to give it to
 
03:41:54.349 --> 03:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
anyone who's gay
 
03:41:56.990 --> 03:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
and that is not true
 
03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
for a heterosexual couple in a
 
03:42:01.370 --> 03:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
heterosexual couple infertility coverage
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
is only if somebody is infertile so I
 
03:42:06.769 --> 03:42:06.779 align:start position:0%
would say is I really don't think this
 
03:42:08.090 --> 03:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
is a good idea
 
03:42:11.030 --> 03:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
to pass this because I lastly we want to
 
03:42:13.370 --> 03:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
tell everybody is that we're now going
 
03:42:17.330 --> 03:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:20.330 --> 03:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
special that nobody else had that every
 
03:42:22.790 --> 03:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
so I know we usually like to be talk
 
03:42:24.650 --> 03:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
about fairness we want to do equal
 
03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
what's fair
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm saying under our current statute
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
now for infertility coverage it is fair
 
03:42:34.370 --> 03:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
for everybody
 
03:42:37.190 --> 03:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
there is no sexual no
 
03:42:39.889 --> 03:42:39.899 align:start position:0%
discrimination going on under our
 
03:42:41.570 --> 03:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
03:42:43.610 --> 03:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's the great question to put
 
03:42:46.190 --> 03:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
to a study committee right so I would
 
03:42:50.330 --> 03:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:52.070 --> 03:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think this is a great question then to
 
03:42:54.889 --> 03:42:54.899 align:start position:0%
put to the floor of the house no it will
 
03:42:58.130 --> 03:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
is if this is I mean I I'm my sense this
 
03:43:00.490 --> 03:43:00.500 align:start position:0%
is a 10 10 vote oh gosh
 
03:43:07.250 --> 03:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:09.229 --> 03:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
I know but we're gonna
 
03:43:11.150 --> 03:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
okay so you're not going to vote to
 
03:43:14.210 --> 03:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:17.630 --> 03:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
so your our deal was is off now
 
03:43:19.370 --> 03:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
you really want to have this debate on
 
03:43:20.330 --> 03:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
03:43:22.190 --> 03:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
no we don't want to have this debate on
 
03:43:25.570 --> 03:43:25.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:33.469 --> 03:43:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
there is an because of the the
 
03:43:39.170 --> 03:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
definition of social infertility which
 
03:43:42.349 --> 03:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
means that they're both fertile but
 
03:43:44.809 --> 03:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
in the in that case this the Sexes are
 
03:43:49.849 --> 03:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
the same so socially they can't have a
 
03:43:49.859 --> 03:43:50.809 align:start position:0%
the same so socially they can't have a
child

03:43:50.809 --> 03:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:43:50.819 --> 03:43:53.030 align:start position:0%
child
naturally

03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
naturally
 
03:43:55.670 --> 03:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
does bring up a point
 
03:44:02.450 --> 03:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:05.030 --> 03:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
and while I want to support the lbgt
 
03:44:11.450 --> 03:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
if they we're the pro to me the way the
 
03:44:17.210 --> 03:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
problem comes in is if the couple are
 
03:44:19.849 --> 03:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
both transgendered
 
03:44:22.010 --> 03:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
then they probably can't have kids at
 
03:44:22.020 --> 03:44:24.590 align:start position:0%
then they probably can't have kids at
all

03:44:24.590 --> 03:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
what in that case I would ask would the
 
03:44:30.590 --> 03:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
insurance cover that case they're
 
03:44:32.330 --> 03:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
they're definitely infertile
 
03:44:34.910 --> 03:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
would the insurance cover a
 
03:44:37.969 --> 03:44:37.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:42.530 --> 03:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
uh because they are physically unable
 
03:44:48.170 --> 03:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:48.180 --> 03:44:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:44:49.670 --> 03:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:49.680 --> 03:44:52.010 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

03:44:52.010 --> 03:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:44:53.330 --> 03:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
I don't even know how many of that
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
applies to
 
03:44:57.410 --> 03:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
yeah you know I'm just because you said
 
03:44:59.570 --> 03:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
well because you're assuming that that
 
03:45:02.870 --> 03:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
they have have had a surgical procedure
 
03:45:07.250 --> 03:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
that caused them to be infertile right
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have the bill in front of
 
03:45:10.849 --> 03:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
us anybody have the bill in front of
 
03:45:12.590 --> 03:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
them the current excuse me the current
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
law I do not believe it says anything
 
03:45:19.809 --> 03:45:19.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:36.050 --> 03:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.510 --> 03:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
because you're saying I'm listening to
 
03:45:40.790 --> 03:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
you and I'm hearing you say that we
 
03:45:43.490 --> 03:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
already have measures in place statutes
 
03:45:45.889 --> 03:45:45.899 align:start position:0%
in place to cover and now I'm hearing
 
03:45:48.410 --> 03:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
from the other side well no we really
 
03:45:48.420 --> 03:45:49.550 align:start position:0%
from the other side well no we really
don't

03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:45:52.190 --> 03:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
so lose right it's correct and it's
 
03:45:52.200 --> 03:45:53.450 align:start position:0%
so lose right it's correct and it's
incorrect

03:45:53.450 --> 03:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
03:45:55.969 --> 03:45:55.979 align:start position:0%
and doesn't this ineffective thanks for
 
03:45:58.150 --> 03:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
a little more work
 
03:46:00.349 --> 03:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs and I also
 
03:46:03.530 --> 03:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
would question why if if I'm sorry am I
 
03:46:04.910 --> 03:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
going to get well before we go into the
 
03:46:06.229 --> 03:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
next question can we get an answer to my
 
03:46:07.969 --> 03:46:07.979 align:start position:0%
question oh okay I'm sorry no that's
 
03:46:09.710 --> 03:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
good how many have been out of the speed
 
03:46:09.720 --> 03:46:10.729 align:start position:0%
good how many have been out of the speed
effect

03:46:10.729 --> 03:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
effect
 
03:46:15.469 --> 03:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:17.870 --> 03:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
how do we know how do we know
 
03:46:20.030 --> 03:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is the spot the
 
03:46:20.040 --> 03:46:21.590 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is the spot the
sponsors

03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
sponsors
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
you just uh make sure the mic is on and
 
03:46:26.090 --> 03:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
you pull it real close to yourself
 
03:46:27.889 --> 03:46:27.899 align:start position:0%
um I'm Catherine Tucker can you hear me
 
03:46:29.929 --> 03:46:29.939 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and I practice uh infertility
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:36.960 --> 03:46:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:41.450 --> 03:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the chair is correct that
 
03:46:43.429 --> 03:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
a same-sex couple who has medical
 
03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
infertility is going to be covered under
 
03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
the current bill however most folks
 
03:46:49.309 --> 03:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
don't go into trying to have a baby
 
03:46:50.450 --> 03:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
knowing that they have medical
 
03:46:52.910 --> 03:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
infertility they go in and they start
 
03:46:55.370 --> 03:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
trying and if it doesn't work after a
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
certain period of time or if there's you
 
03:46:59.450 --> 03:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
know a semen analysis that comes back
 
03:47:01.309 --> 03:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
with poor motility or something that's
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
how they would discover that they in
 
03:47:05.570 --> 03:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
fact have a medical infertility so what
 
03:47:07.490 --> 03:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
this is is this the cost study would be
 
03:47:09.710 --> 03:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
looking at expanding the coverage to
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
start for infertile cup I'm sorry to
 
03:47:13.729 --> 03:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
start for same-sex couples right with
 
03:47:15.769 --> 03:47:15.779 align:start position:0%
their very first time of trying so for
 
03:47:17.809 --> 03:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
female couples that is typically in
 
03:47:19.790 --> 03:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
insemination that takes place at the OB
 
03:47:22.429 --> 03:47:22.439 align:start position:0%
gyn's office and for male couples that
 
03:47:25.490 --> 03:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
would be the process of forming embryos
 
03:47:26.809 --> 03:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
that would later be used with a
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
gestational carrier and right now a
 
03:47:31.490 --> 03:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of my clients that are
 
03:47:33.469 --> 03:47:33.479 align:start position:0%
coming to me who are female couples or
 
03:47:35.809 --> 03:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
male couples do not have coverage to
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
start the process a small portion of
 
03:47:41.030 --> 03:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
them do not have success and then become
 
03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
eligible to as medically internal to
 
03:47:46.490 --> 03:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
start the process and so at that point
 
03:47:48.170 --> 03:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
they would get coverage and you know
 
03:47:49.849 --> 03:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
there's some a whole bunch of issues
 
03:47:52.130 --> 03:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
there also but that I think we can work
 
03:47:53.690 --> 03:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
administratively with the insurance
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:58.319 --> 03:48:00.170 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

03:48:00.170 --> 03:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:48:00.180 --> 03:48:02.349 align:start position:0%
chairman
yes

03:48:02.349 --> 03:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:48:05.809 --> 03:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
thank you right in in thinking this
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
thing through
 
03:48:10.610 --> 03:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
um I was puzzled I wondered how far it
 
03:48:14.269 --> 03:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
went does it go as far as as using a
 
03:48:14.279 --> 03:48:15.710 align:start position:0%
went does it go as far as as using a
surrogate

03:48:15.710 --> 03:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
surrogate
 
03:48:17.870 --> 03:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
and if you use the surrogate
 
03:48:20.210 --> 03:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
I don't think the bill should pay the
 
03:48:22.729 --> 03:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
fee for the surrogate but the surrogate
 
03:48:25.309 --> 03:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
was presumably have medical coverage
 
03:48:27.950 --> 03:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
themselves and that that part would be
 
03:48:30.410 --> 03:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
covered the birthing process does it
 
03:48:33.170 --> 03:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
mean that go that far this is only for
 
03:48:35.450 --> 03:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
medical costs so any fees paid to the
 
03:48:37.729 --> 03:48:37.739 align:start position:0%
surrogate would not be included and in
 
03:48:39.769 --> 03:48:39.779 align:start position:0%
addition our current infertility law
 
03:48:42.229 --> 03:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
does not cover embryo transfers to the
 
03:48:43.490 --> 03:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
surrogate so that is something that's
 
03:48:45.769 --> 03:48:45.779 align:start position:0%
always going to be cash pay out of
 
03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
pocket for the patients for whatever
 
03:48:49.070 --> 03:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
reason that they need to turn to a
 
03:48:50.809 --> 03:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
surrogate so this is just for the
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
medical costs of getting the eggs
 
03:48:55.490 --> 03:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
getting the sperm making the embryos
 
03:48:58.010 --> 03:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
which is called the in vitro process is
 
03:48:59.929 --> 03:48:59.939 align:start position:0%
vitro okay that's the key word here is
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
in vitro yes for for the men that's what
 
03:49:04.490 --> 03:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
they need for the female couples they
 
03:49:06.290 --> 03:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
can start with insemination which is a
 
03:49:08.090 --> 03:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
much lower
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
um less lower Tech technical process
 
03:49:14.809 --> 03:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
um and much cheaper but the bottom line
 
03:49:16.190 --> 03:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
is we don't know what these things are
 
03:49:19.250 --> 03:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
going to cost and based on what I know I
 
03:49:20.690 --> 03:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
think right it's actually going to be a
 
03:49:23.229 --> 03:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
money saver to for to the carriers
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
because based on how we've seen things
 
03:49:31.070 --> 03:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:33.170 --> 03:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
well if if the insurance companies could
 
03:49:34.490 --> 03:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
save money then they don't need to be
 
03:49:36.590 --> 03:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
mandated they would do that on their own
 
03:49:38.690 --> 03:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
and that's what the purpose of the cost
 
03:49:40.729 --> 03:49:40.739 align:start position:0%
studies let's see what this costs and
 
03:49:43.130 --> 03:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
maybe then that study going to work how
 
03:49:45.950 --> 03:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
do we how we what do we get I mean I
 
03:49:47.929 --> 03:49:47.939 align:start position:0%
guess I mean we could start with so
 
03:49:50.210 --> 03:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
exactly how much has this mandate cost
 
03:49:52.550 --> 03:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
us so far
 
03:49:54.110 --> 03:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
that would I think that that would be
 
03:49:55.550 --> 03:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
one factor I mean we're talking about
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
the experts the actual experts who can
 
03:50:00.650 --> 03:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
use their knowledge so figure this out
 
03:50:02.510 --> 03:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
again I would argue we don't need a
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
study committee to do that this
 
03:50:06.590 --> 03:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
committee can get those kind of
 
03:50:08.090 --> 03:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
questions answered
 
03:50:10.910 --> 03:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
we don't need a study committee and and
 
03:50:12.830 --> 03:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying that you know I know you
 
03:50:14.330 --> 03:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
guys think study committees are great
 
03:50:16.969 --> 03:50:16.979 align:start position:0%
things but someone who's done plenty of
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
study caves in my time that unless you
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
have specific language that you want
 
03:50:25.550 --> 03:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
them to come back with the statute we
 
03:50:27.650 --> 03:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
have a separate law on our books right
 
03:50:30.830 --> 03:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
now that allows us as a committee to
 
03:50:33.229 --> 03:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
order the department to do an economic
 
03:50:36.830 --> 03:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
study okay and uh I guess I should know
 
03:50:41.090 --> 03:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
the RSA but um I mean I I refer to the
 
03:50:43.969 --> 03:50:43.979 align:start position:0%
lobbyist who who came up with it you
 
03:50:46.190 --> 03:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
know Liz Murphy and I called the Liz
 
03:50:48.889 --> 03:50:48.899 align:start position:0%
Murphy law but it was uh it was the
 
03:50:52.370 --> 03:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
intent is that yes we as a committee
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
can be specific in asking the department
 
03:50:57.469 --> 03:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
to come back with what something costs
 
03:50:59.809 --> 03:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
what what is the economic cost going to
 
03:51:02.809 --> 03:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
be my problem with this bill is it's so
 
03:51:06.170 --> 03:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
wide open when you put in single
 
03:51:07.849 --> 03:51:07.859 align:start position:0%
are you going to then say some you're
 
03:51:09.050 --> 03:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
going to expect an insurance department
 
03:51:11.690 --> 03:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
to do a calculation of how many single
 
03:51:14.410 --> 03:51:14.420 align:start position:0%
people might want to have children
 
03:51:25.330 --> 03:51:25.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:28.190 --> 03:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
are we being asked to do this on the
 
03:51:29.990 --> 03:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
basis of anecdotal
 
03:51:34.389 --> 03:51:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh evidence or surmised or projected
 
03:51:37.490 --> 03:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
evidence rather than actual
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
cases numbers of people who have been
 
03:51:40.319 --> 03:51:42.170 align:start position:0%
cases numbers of people who have been
denied

03:51:42.170 --> 03:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
denied
 
03:51:44.690 --> 03:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
in your in your views uh what's going on
 
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
so people aren't even getting denied and
 
03:51:48.469 --> 03:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
the reason is that the fertility clinics
 
03:51:50.990 --> 03:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
won't even submit the request to the
 
03:51:52.910 --> 03:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
insurance company so there's no denial
 
03:51:55.070 --> 03:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
records how do you know this that's what
 
03:51:57.889 --> 03:51:57.899 align:start position:0%
I'm asking I talk with the I talk with
 
03:52:00.050 --> 03:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
clients patients I talk with doctors I
 
03:52:01.490 --> 03:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
talk with people at the fertility
 
03:52:01.500 --> 03:52:03.229 align:start position:0%
talk with people at the fertility
clinics

03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
clinics
 
03:52:07.130 --> 03:52:07.140 align:start position:0%
What's the magnitude of the problem
 
03:52:09.170 --> 03:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
every single female couple and every
 
03:52:10.610 --> 03:52:10.620 align:start position:0%
single male couple who's looking to
 
03:52:12.710 --> 03:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
procreate as well as single individuals
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
magnitude means the size the number I
 
03:52:17.389 --> 03:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
can't I can't give you a number but I'm
 
03:52:19.729 --> 03:52:19.739 align:start position:0%
happy to go and look into that and see
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
what we can come up with
 
03:52:23.450 --> 03:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
um that would be helpful yes are we
 
03:52:25.610 --> 03:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
talking about hundreds thousands tens
 
03:52:27.650 --> 03:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
yes that would be helpful yes I don't
 
03:52:29.570 --> 03:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
know that right now I don't know how big
 
03:52:31.849 --> 03:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
a problem we have if we have a problem I
 
03:52:33.170 --> 03:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
don't even know if you have a problem
 
03:52:33.180 --> 03:52:34.790 align:start position:0%
don't even know if you have a problem
change

03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:52:34.800 --> 03:52:37.910 align:start position:0%
change
representative

03:52:37.910 --> 03:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:40.610 --> 03:52:40.620 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry it would seem that that's
 
03:52:42.769 --> 03:52:42.779 align:start position:0%
a perfect question to put to a study
 
03:52:42.779 --> 03:52:43.670 align:start position:0%
a perfect question to put to a study
committee

03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:52:46.969 --> 03:52:46.979 align:start position:0%
yeah what is the scope of the problem
 
03:52:49.729 --> 03:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
right so right now under our statute did
 
03:52:52.250 --> 03:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
to require that ask the returns
 
03:52:54.889 --> 03:52:54.899 align:start position:0%
department to do that economic study it
 
03:52:56.389 --> 03:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
has to come from this committee it
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
cannot come from a study committee
 
03:52:59.690 --> 03:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
you'll be part of the economic part of
 
03:53:01.130 --> 03:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
the economic study would be first to
 
03:53:02.929 --> 03:53:02.939 align:start position:0%
determine the scope of what is the
 
03:53:04.550 --> 03:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
economic and I'm telling you you're
 
03:53:06.590 --> 03:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
speaking to him retaining because under
 
03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
our this way the statue right you know
 
03:53:12.110 --> 03:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
the Murphy Law works it's not a study
 
03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
committee requesting it it has to be
 
03:53:18.650 --> 03:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
requested by a actual standing committee
 
03:53:20.750 --> 03:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
and I think it even says Congress in the
 
03:53:22.309 --> 03:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
statute I don't know
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative spirit I I've had a
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
problem with a lot of the study
 
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
committees that we've that we've tried
 
03:53:30.050 --> 03:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
to set up I mean that have been asked
 
03:53:32.090 --> 03:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
for with various bills
 
03:53:34.010 --> 03:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
and it has been my feeling all along
 
03:53:36.410 --> 03:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
that if we don't know the scope of the
 
03:53:36.420 --> 03:53:37.309 align:start position:0%
that if we don't know the scope of the
problem

03:53:37.309 --> 03:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:53:39.410 --> 03:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
then we don't have any business studying
 
03:53:39.420 --> 03:53:41.389 align:start position:0%
then we don't have any business studying
it

03:53:41.389 --> 03:53:41.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:53:43.790 --> 03:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
I think that retaining it and investing
 
03:53:45.530 --> 03:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
and asking the insurance company to
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
investigate it is good
 
03:53:49.490 --> 03:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
but just willy-nilly throwing study
 
03:53:50.750 --> 03:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
committees out there without even
 
03:53:53.389 --> 03:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
knowing if there was a problem I have a
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
problem with because then in fact
 
03:53:58.670 --> 03:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
this this the uh taxpayers are paying
 
03:54:00.290 --> 03:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
for that and we should know what the
 
03:54:03.349 --> 03:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
size of that is I'm I'm sorry that's I I
 
03:54:04.910 --> 03:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
don't go along with study committees
 
03:54:07.190 --> 03:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
that don't have a scope you're okay with
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
retaining absolutely I think I think
 
03:54:11.210 --> 03:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
it's a very worthwhile thing to start to
 
03:54:11.220 --> 03:54:20.110 align:start position:0%
it's a very worthwhile thing to start to
understand

03:54:20.110 --> 03:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:22.849 --> 03:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
would you be okay with retaining so that
 
03:54:25.130 --> 03:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
we could work on it
 
03:54:27.050 --> 03:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
I'd move itl
 
03:54:30.650 --> 03:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:32.929 --> 03:54:32.939 align:start position:0%
I would move itl
 
03:54:38.269 --> 03:54:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
what's your rationale for Ito
 
03:54:43.969 --> 03:54:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:45.950 --> 03:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
so that that that's an opinion that's
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
been asked for not emotion so are we
 
03:54:51.950 --> 03:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
going to get through a motion uh yeah no
 
03:54:55.490 --> 03:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
I I want to retain it I wanted I wanted
 
03:54:58.490 --> 03:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
I truly want to know more about it for
 
03:55:00.050 --> 03:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
myself personally
 
03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
I am dying to know how much this mandate
 
03:55:06.050 --> 03:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
has cost us so far Mr chairman I voted
 
03:55:07.969 --> 03:55:07.979 align:start position:0%
against this mandate when we passed it
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
four years ago so the opportunity to
 
03:55:12.889 --> 03:55:12.899 align:start position:0%
have a economic study to see how much
 
03:55:15.650 --> 03:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
this how much we paid for it I think is
 
03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
is a wonderful idea so so I I I I'm not
 
03:55:23.090 --> 03:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
saying I would ask you not to that's not
 
03:55:25.550 --> 03:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
Ito that's retained this and and you can
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
take that up and come come November or
 
03:55:29.689 --> 03:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
you know October
 
03:55:32.809 --> 03:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
if if if we're not at that place if you
 
03:55:34.370 --> 03:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
want to then send it to the floor then
 
03:55:35.750 --> 03:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'd say that send it to the floor at
 
03:55:38.330 --> 03:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
that point with an itl motion but at
 
03:55:40.429 --> 03:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
this point I think it's worth retaining
 
03:55:43.429 --> 03:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
it first Mr chair are you moving there I
 
03:55:46.610 --> 03:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
I I I I I'm this is the subcommittee
 
03:55:49.370 --> 03:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
we're trying to you know kind of work
 
03:55:51.889 --> 03:55:51.899 align:start position:0%
work for consensus we want to have kids
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
see you the rest of the afternoon yeah I
 
03:55:56.990 --> 03:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
I would make the motion to retain okay
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just I'm gonna say if I could
 
03:56:02.990 --> 03:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
make a comment I hate to admit it but
 
03:56:05.570 --> 03:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
John Mr Hunt just made some good points
 
03:56:07.610 --> 03:56:07.620 align:start position:0%
I really hate to admit it but he has to
 
03:56:09.950 --> 03:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
the beach
 
03:56:13.750 --> 03:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:16.670 --> 03:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
can I ask a question one question yes
 
03:56:19.969 --> 03:56:19.979 align:start position:0%
how hard is it to get the to ask the
 
03:56:22.010 --> 03:56:22.020 align:start position:0%

03:56:24.290 --> 03:56:24.300 align:start position:0%

it and I think I know in writing do you
 
03:56:36.170 --> 03:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
I know for this in writing I think it's

all I have to do is just say I just I
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%

actual real study

03:58:00.889 --> 03:58:00.899 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:58:15.130 --> 03:58:15.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:19.570 --> 03:58:19.580 align:start position:0%
okay on to another mandate
 
03:58:21.889 --> 03:58:21.899 align:start position:0%
religious Services provided through a
 
03:58:26.689 --> 03:58:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:26.699 --> 03:58:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:58:28.070 --> 03:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:29.929 --> 03:58:29.939 align:start position:0%
John why don't you come up take a seat
 
03:58:29.939 --> 03:58:31.130 align:start position:0%
John why don't you come up take a seat
here

03:58:31.130 --> 03:58:31.140 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:58:35.210 --> 03:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
if I understand this correctly
 
03:58:39.050 --> 03:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
that a primary care physician
 
03:58:42.010 --> 03:58:42.020 align:start position:0%
would be Consulting with a
 
03:58:44.990 --> 03:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy psychologist
 
03:58:48.410 --> 03:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
and the psychologist says yes Xanax is
 
03:58:48.420 --> 03:58:49.729 align:start position:0%
and the psychologist says yes Xanax is
recommended

03:58:49.729 --> 03:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
then the primary care physician because
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
they have the rights to order
 
03:58:57.530 --> 03:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
prescriptions could then order that
 
03:59:03.410 --> 03:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:05.809 --> 03:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the uh
 
03:59:08.689 --> 03:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
a psychologist is not licensed to
 
03:59:10.490 --> 03:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
prescribe medication so they can't do
 
03:59:13.550 --> 03:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
that so they would not if a psychologist
 
03:59:16.729 --> 03:59:16.739 align:start position:0%
felt there was a medication assessment
 
03:59:18.469 --> 03:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
that was needed they would refer the
 
03:59:22.010 --> 03:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
primary care physician to a psychiatrist
 
03:59:24.530 --> 03:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
they would refer to it they would they
 
03:59:26.210 --> 03:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
would suggest the primary care
 
03:59:27.469 --> 03:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
physicians speak with a psychiatrist
 
03:59:28.969 --> 03:59:28.979 align:start position:0%
through the collaborative care model
 
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
which is a different model but similar
 
03:59:35.210 --> 03:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
so why why is it some people think that
 
03:59:37.849 --> 03:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
it looks like a psychologists are
 
03:59:39.710 --> 03:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
involved in prescription drugs with this
 
03:59:42.050 --> 03:59:42.060 align:start position:0%
bill why has that been accusation been
 
03:59:43.790 --> 03:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
made by the psychiatrist
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
well I've spoken with a psychiatrist and
 
03:59:47.570 --> 03:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
have not heard that it's a talking point
 
03:59:49.550 --> 03:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that there was there is
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that suggests that
 
03:59:53.689 --> 03:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
psychologists are or request
 
03:59:55.849 --> 03:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
psychologists be involved in prescribing
 
03:59:57.290 --> 03:59:57.300 align:start position:0%
medication it's just it's not part of
 
03:59:59.330 --> 03:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
the S Copa practice
 
04:00:03.110 --> 04:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay so why do we need this bill
 
04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
wait a minute so representative Calabro
 
04:00:07.550 --> 04:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
you have very strong opinions I'd say
 
04:00:09.530 --> 04:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I've actually experienced this and
 
04:00:11.570 --> 04:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
it de-escalates situations and it
 
04:00:13.010 --> 04:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
prevents patients from going into the
 
04:00:14.990 --> 04:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
emergency room and using resources that
 
04:00:16.729 --> 04:00:16.739 align:start position:0%
would otherwise have gone to somebody in
 
04:00:19.070 --> 04:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
an actual emergency need so if I'm
 
04:00:21.309 --> 04:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
sitting here with a patient who's at PQ
 
04:00:24.349 --> 04:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
PA you're a psychologist no I'm a
 
04:00:25.849 --> 04:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
provider we've had somebody roomed
 
04:00:27.410 --> 04:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
they've got a behavioral emergency with
 
04:00:29.389 --> 04:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
a phq score
 
04:00:32.030 --> 04:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
all right of of an elevated number it
 
04:00:34.189 --> 04:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
lets me know this person has an o is at
 
04:00:35.689 --> 04:00:35.699 align:start position:0%
an elevated risk for a behavioral
 
04:00:37.729 --> 04:00:37.739 align:start position:0%
emergency every single person in
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
medicine knows how to deal with that
 
04:00:41.689 --> 04:00:41.699 align:start position:0%
okay we all have protocols about what we
 
04:00:41.699 --> 04:00:42.889 align:start position:0%
okay we all have protocols about what we
do

04:00:42.889 --> 04:00:42.899 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:00:44.090 --> 04:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
we either send them to the emergency
 
04:00:46.670 --> 04:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
room or God bless we have somebody on
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
call we can call them down to help and
 
04:00:50.510 --> 04:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
de-escalate the situation so I'm not
 
04:00:52.010 --> 04:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
sitting with that patient for 40 minutes
 
04:00:54.650 --> 04:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
I'm stay I'm staying on time now I've
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
got a psychologist who can de-escalate
 
04:00:58.250 --> 04:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
teach them the coping skills they need
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
get them to where they need to be then
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
they can come back to me and have an
 
04:01:04.130 --> 04:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
actual meaningful discourse and we can
 
04:01:06.290 --> 04:01:06.300 align:start position:0%
make a treatment plan going forward that
 
04:01:08.330 --> 04:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
will oftentimes involve psychologists
 
04:01:08.340 --> 04:01:09.830 align:start position:0%
will oftentimes involve psychologists
psychiatry

04:01:09.830 --> 04:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
psychiatry
 
04:01:11.689 --> 04:01:11.699 align:start position:0%
because I don't feel comfortable being
 
04:01:13.490 --> 04:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
Psychiatry alone though that is
 
04:01:14.990 --> 04:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
basically what I was forced to do in
 
04:01:17.030 --> 04:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis for the state
 
04:01:19.250 --> 04:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you this is this is going to
 
04:01:21.710 --> 04:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
save a lot of resources it's not a bad
 
04:01:21.720 --> 04:01:23.030 align:start position:0%
save a lot of resources it's not a bad
choice

04:01:23.030 --> 04:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
choice
 
04:01:25.010 --> 04:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's logarithmically growing across the
 
04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
country we're trained to do it it's a
 
04:01:30.050 --> 04:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
very effective model so why isn't this
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
already occurring why do we have this
 
04:01:33.050 --> 04:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
fighting everywhere so why do we need
 
04:01:34.370 --> 04:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
because apparently they haven't gotten
 
04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
the clue
 
04:01:38.160 --> 04:01:41.210 align:start position:0%
the clue
who

04:01:41.210 --> 04:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:43.670 --> 04:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
I would say the insurance companies so
 
04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
you're saying the insurance companies
 
04:01:47.210 --> 04:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
are refusing
 
04:01:49.969 --> 04:01:49.979 align:start position:0%
what what did they refuse what what part
 
04:01:52.450 --> 04:01:52.460 align:start position:0%
of this process
 
04:01:54.889 --> 04:01:54.899 align:start position:0%
primary I'm seeing a patient you're
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to refer someone to I
 
04:02:00.349 --> 04:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
will refer them emergently to Psychiatry
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
for a particular score I'm also going to
 
04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
have a psychologist go in and see them
 
04:02:05.809 --> 04:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
they will have spent 45 minutes
 
04:02:07.490 --> 04:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
de-escalating with a patient they can't
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
bill for it now I can go in and take
 
04:02:11.929 --> 04:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
care of them medically I'm going to
 
04:02:13.429 --> 04:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
prescribe whatever medications are
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
needed to stabilize them until we can
 
04:02:18.110 --> 04:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
get them to Psychiatry I can bill for
 
04:02:20.210 --> 04:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
them that's the problem
 
04:02:22.670 --> 04:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
what wait a minute again we're talking
 
04:02:25.370 --> 04:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
about the primary care physician
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
making a referral
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
so why when they just refer to the
 
04:02:32.929 --> 04:02:32.939 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists if if you mean isn't
 
04:02:34.670 --> 04:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
Psychiatry doesn't have openings like
 
04:02:34.680 --> 04:02:36.950 align:start position:0%
Psychiatry doesn't have openings like
that

04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:39.650 --> 04:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by openings they aren't
 
04:02:40.969 --> 04:02:40.979 align:start position:0%
going to be available for sometimes two
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
and three months
 
04:02:45.170 --> 04:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage John that's why we
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
need these people so you're looking for
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
the psychologists
 
04:02:51.710 --> 04:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
to de-escalate a situation to give them
 
04:02:53.150 --> 04:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
the coping skills they need so they lead
 
04:02:55.429 --> 04:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
us medication I will Bridge them until
 
04:02:57.769 --> 04:02:57.779 align:start position:0%
they can meet with psychiatry and we
 
04:02:59.389 --> 04:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
will have a treatment plan with a
 
04:03:01.370 --> 04:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
psychologist usually the one that I just
 
04:03:03.469 --> 04:03:03.479 align:start position:0%
brought in as an on-call basis is a soft
 
04:03:05.809 --> 04:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
handoff it's part of the collaborative
 
04:03:07.729 --> 04:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
matter the model
 
04:03:10.309 --> 04:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
It's very effective for people with a
 
04:03:12.889 --> 04:03:12.899 align:start position:0%
very small limited number of staff
 
04:03:15.769 --> 04:03:15.779 align:start position:0%
that's why we do it right you get okay
 
04:03:17.689 --> 04:03:17.699 align:start position:0%
so because we had the last time we had a
 
04:03:20.030 --> 04:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
collaborative bill it was it was
 
04:03:20.040 --> 04:03:21.830 align:start position:0%
collaborative bill it was it was
basically

04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:03:24.410 --> 04:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
um you know it was intervening in what
 
04:03:26.389 --> 04:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
is now the current practice which is the
 
04:03:28.490 --> 04:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
referral process
 
04:03:31.330 --> 04:03:31.340 align:start position:0%
so it was a tag team
 
04:03:33.469 --> 04:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
this is actually a little more
 
04:03:35.689 --> 04:03:35.699 align:start position:0%
collaborative and integrated
 
04:03:37.729 --> 04:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
this is a lot more but then we're
 
04:03:39.769 --> 04:03:39.779 align:start position:0%
practicing medicine like this is
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
something that's got to be decided by
 
04:03:43.729 --> 04:03:43.739 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine
 
04:03:46.670 --> 04:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
this is not what we do I think this
 
04:03:48.969 --> 04:03:48.979 align:start position:0%
isn't that complicated okay
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative field
 
04:03:53.870 --> 04:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
a true question is the problem here then
 
04:03:56.090 --> 04:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
that the psychologist lacks a billing
 
04:03:56.100 --> 04:03:57.050 align:start position:0%
that the psychologist lacks a billing
code

04:03:57.050 --> 04:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
code
 
04:04:00.410 --> 04:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
to be able to bill for their time if the
 
04:04:02.090 --> 04:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
primary care physician does that
 
04:04:04.250 --> 04:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
referral for that what do you mean like
 
04:04:07.610 --> 04:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
the billing time uh billing code let's
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
say the primary care physician does that
 
04:04:11.809 --> 04:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
quick referral for a de-escalation to
 
04:04:13.670 --> 04:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
the psychologist
 
04:04:15.290 --> 04:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
is the problem here then that the
 
04:04:17.210 --> 04:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
psychologist lacks a billing code for
 
04:04:19.849 --> 04:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
that quick referral on for that
 
04:04:23.950 --> 04:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
de-escalation time so John
 
04:04:26.210 --> 04:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you for the question so
 
04:04:28.010 --> 04:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
there's multiple problems here the the
 
04:04:29.929 --> 04:04:29.939 align:start position:0%
the the problem the representative was
 
04:04:31.790 --> 04:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
speaking to is the urgency of the
 
04:04:33.889 --> 04:04:33.899 align:start position:0%
situation it's an emergent situation in
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
either a professional needs to be
 
04:04:38.150 --> 04:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
available to engage with a client to
 
04:04:40.189 --> 04:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
de-escalate them hopefully they'll Skype
 
04:04:41.150 --> 04:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
them or they're going to be in an
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
emergency room or an inpatient unit
 
04:04:46.610 --> 04:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the urgency of the
 
04:04:49.130 --> 04:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
issue the in terms of the billing codes
 
04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
so when we started this process we
 
04:04:54.349 --> 04:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
reached out to Anthem and we reached out
 
04:04:56.210 --> 04:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
to 0.32 and we've had a number of
 
04:04:57.650 --> 04:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
conversations and those conversations
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
have continued to some extent and
 
04:05:00.889 --> 04:05:00.899 align:start position:0%
they've picked up over the last couple
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
of days
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
Anthem first forwarded to my client a
 
04:05:08.450 --> 04:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
list of building codes applicable to
 
04:05:10.969 --> 04:05:10.979 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists and psychologists
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
the consultation codes were applicable
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
to psychiatrist contracts they were
 
04:05:18.110 --> 04:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
listed as not applicable to psychologist
 
04:05:21.729 --> 04:05:21.739 align:start position:0%
contracts so we raised that with Anthem
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
and Anthem told my client that that was
 
04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
a surprise to them that they believed
 
04:05:28.490 --> 04:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
that psychologists could be built could
 
04:05:30.349 --> 04:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
bill for these coats
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
the problem is we've been having this
 
04:05:35.870 --> 04:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
conversation since October November and
 
04:05:37.610 --> 04:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
really haven't
 
04:05:40.250 --> 04:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten any clearer resolution
 
04:05:42.650 --> 04:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
about whether a psychologist can or
 
04:05:45.530 --> 04:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
cannot bill for consultation
 
04:05:48.710 --> 04:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's why my client did a survey with
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
practicing psychologists in the field 86
 
04:05:53.090 --> 04:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
percent of the psychologists who
 
04:05:56.090 --> 04:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
responded said that they either did not
 
04:05:56.100 --> 04:05:57.110 align:start position:0%
responded said that they either did not
bill

04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:06:00.349 --> 04:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
for consultation codes or were denied
 
04:06:02.330 --> 04:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
for consultation codes when we when they
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
were asked why didn't you Bill most of
 
04:06:06.349 --> 04:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
them were told that historically they've
 
04:06:08.330 --> 04:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
been denied for consultation codes and
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
they stopped billing because it wasn't
 
04:06:12.469 --> 04:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
worth the effort now
 
04:06:15.229 --> 04:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
insurance I don't come here a lot for
 
04:06:17.210 --> 04:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
good reason insurance is a very complex
 
04:06:18.830 --> 04:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
issue and you folks are the experts on
 
04:06:23.210 --> 04:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
that I believe that Anthem and point 32
 
04:06:25.370 --> 04:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
and good faith told us they believe
 
04:06:27.530 --> 04:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
these should be covered but I do know
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
from my clients that they are not
 
04:06:29.279 --> 04:06:30.469 align:start position:0%
from my clients that they are not
covered

04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
covered
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
I can't bridge that divide to know where
 
04:06:38.330 --> 04:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
the truth lies but what I do know is
 
04:06:41.090 --> 04:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
that this is a newer model
 
04:06:44.870 --> 04:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
of uh of integrated care collaborative
 
04:06:48.290 --> 04:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
care being the other more common model
 
04:06:50.750 --> 04:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
from my clients to have Primary Care
 
04:06:52.630 --> 04:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
practices set up
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
set up agreements with them the primary
 
04:06:57.410 --> 04:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
care practices are going to want to know
 
04:07:00.110 --> 04:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
that these are reimbursable codes and
 
04:07:01.969 --> 04:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
that they're endorsed by the legislature
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
and the insurance companies that's what
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to know before
 
04:07:06.410 --> 04:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
they'll even set up a contract or even
 
04:07:07.910 --> 04:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
have that conversation
 
04:07:10.610 --> 04:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
what this bill is intended to do very
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
simply is to establish this as a valid
 
04:07:17.330 --> 04:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
model of integrated care and it says
 
04:07:18.650 --> 04:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
throughout that the primary care
 
04:07:21.290 --> 04:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
practices do not need to use this they
 
04:07:23.389 --> 04:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
can say well we don't use it
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
what we believe in practice though is
 
04:07:29.570 --> 04:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
that collaborative care which is with a
 
04:07:32.090 --> 04:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist as the consultant and
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Behavioral Health which is
 
04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
as a non a licensed non-sychiatrist as
 
04:07:41.150 --> 04:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
the consultant work very well in tandem
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
for the ex for the very first question
 
04:07:44.349 --> 04:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
you asked
 
04:07:47.210 --> 04:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
psychologists social workers can't
 
04:07:49.490 --> 04:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
prescribe medication and are not looking
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
for the ability to prescribe medication
 
04:07:55.010 --> 04:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
so anytime medication is a likely
 
04:07:55.020 --> 04:07:56.450 align:start position:0%
so anytime medication is a likely
alternative

04:07:56.450 --> 04:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
04:07:58.189 --> 04:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
then it needs to be a psychiatrist
 
04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
working with the primary care doctor
 
04:08:02.210 --> 04:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
the problem with the primary care
 
04:08:04.070 --> 04:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
doctors have though is that they're not
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
experts in Behavioral Health
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
they have a rotation they have some
 
04:08:10.969 --> 04:08:10.979 align:start position:0%
training in medical school maybe they
 
04:08:12.650 --> 04:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
have more clients with mental health
 
04:08:14.570 --> 04:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
issues than they want
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
but they're not experts and a colleague
 
04:08:18.650 --> 04:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
of mine used to say
 
04:08:21.710 --> 04:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
when a hammer is the only tool you have
 
04:08:24.349 --> 04:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
that's the tool you use
 
04:08:26.389 --> 04:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
for primary care doctors medication is
 
04:08:28.189 --> 04:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
their hammer
 
04:08:30.050 --> 04:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
and you heard from
 
04:08:31.729 --> 04:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
one of the psychologists who testified
 
04:08:34.490 --> 04:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
that in some cases she mentioned panic
 
04:08:37.070 --> 04:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
attacks specifically medication can be
 
04:08:37.080 --> 04:08:38.269 align:start position:0%
attacks specifically medication can be
detrimental

04:08:38.269 --> 04:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
detrimental
 
04:08:40.729 --> 04:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
to the long-term recovery
 
04:08:43.370 --> 04:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
so this is not about
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
you know psychologists looking to do
 
04:08:47.809 --> 04:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
things that they don't do already
 
04:08:50.769 --> 04:08:50.779 align:start position:0%
this is about trying to service the
 
04:08:54.050 --> 04:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
patients of the state who have a
 
04:08:56.090 --> 04:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
significant mental health need we we
 
04:08:57.410 --> 04:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
talk all the time I don't know about
 
04:08:59.210 --> 04:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
this committee but we talk in many other
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
committees about the workforce crisis
 
04:09:03.710 --> 04:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
there is a significant mental health
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce crisis
 
04:09:09.050 --> 04:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
it is going to take years if not longer
 
04:09:11.090 --> 04:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
to remedy that I mean I'm working on
 
04:09:12.769 --> 04:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
other legislation to try to address that
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
but it's going to take years to remedy
 
04:09:16.910 --> 04:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
the Mental Health crisis what this bill
 
04:09:19.969 --> 04:09:19.979 align:start position:0%
in front of you is is a bridge to that
 
04:09:22.370 --> 04:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
eventuality of building out the system
 
04:09:24.410 --> 04:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
why is it a bridge well it's a bridge
 
04:09:26.030 --> 04:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
because psychologists have three and
 
04:09:27.769 --> 04:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
four month waiting periods
 
04:09:30.290 --> 04:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
recently I needed my own therapy I
 
04:09:31.729 --> 04:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
reached out I could not get an
 
04:09:33.889 --> 04:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
appointment for at least four months
 
04:09:36.290 --> 04:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
at that point the situational crisis was
 
04:09:38.450 --> 04:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
resolved and there's no need for it but
 
04:09:41.830 --> 04:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
for folks who were in in a much more
 
04:09:44.689 --> 04:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
debilitated situation it's not they
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
can't wait three or four months they
 
04:09:48.889 --> 04:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
can't wait three or four days
 
04:09:52.490 --> 04:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
so this sets up a system where you're
 
04:09:55.130 --> 04:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
not looking for long-term therapy you're
 
04:09:58.729 --> 04:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
looking for an emergency intervention by
 
04:10:01.610 --> 04:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
a trained behavioral health professional
 
04:10:04.729 --> 04:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
to at the hopefully
 
04:10:07.130 --> 04:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
hopefully eliminate the need for
 
04:10:09.050 --> 04:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
hospitalization or emergency care that's
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
the that's the goal but at the very
 
04:10:14.450 --> 04:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
least help them to extend out for a few
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
days until maybe they need another
 
04:10:18.590 --> 04:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up appointment maybe they have to
 
04:10:20.750 --> 04:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
be referred by this by the pcbh
 
04:10:22.990 --> 04:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
professional outside of the primary care
 
04:10:26.570 --> 04:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
to a mental health Community Mental
 
04:10:28.250 --> 04:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
Health Center or you know what have you
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
to bridge them so that they can not be
 
04:10:35.150 --> 04:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
hospitalized or spend weeks in the
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
emergency room I don't think any one of
 
04:10:39.170 --> 04:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
us at least of all the insurance
 
04:10:40.849 --> 04:10:40.859 align:start position:0%
companies want to see patients in the
 
04:10:42.650 --> 04:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
emergency room needlessly because they
 
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
can't get mental health care it is far
 
04:10:51.650 --> 04:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:54.410 --> 04:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
I do have my question oh did they ever
 
04:10:57.670 --> 04:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:01.010 --> 04:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
external review this is like the most
 
04:11:02.870 --> 04:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
important legislation I've ever passed
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
on health care and that is that when
 
04:11:07.370 --> 04:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
you've been denied
 
04:11:12.290 --> 04:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
you request a review external review
 
04:11:15.050 --> 04:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
it's are you talking about the
 
04:11:15.060 --> 04:11:16.630 align:start position:0%
it's are you talking about the
psychologists

04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
psychologists
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
any physician who requested insurance
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
company denies it
 
04:11:24.410 --> 04:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
you then go through external review I'm
 
04:11:26.150 --> 04:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
I cannot answer I don't have the
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
information I can reach out to the
 
04:11:30.170 --> 04:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
psychologist and ask that it would have
 
04:11:31.309 --> 04:11:31.319 align:start position:0%
been several years ago but I can't
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
answer it right so here's here's what my
 
04:11:36.110 --> 04:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill is okay and that
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
is we're talking about a model
 
04:11:42.910 --> 04:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
a behavioral model this is a methodology
 
04:11:46.130 --> 04:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
okay in in schools they call it the
 
04:11:49.729 --> 04:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
pedagogy okay this is a pet a pedagogy
 
04:11:52.670 --> 04:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
of which we're going to use to for
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
mental health services okay so the
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
question now becomes when I read the
 
04:12:01.070 --> 04:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
bill it says in here that it's the
 
04:12:05.510 --> 04:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
primary care provider who gets to choose
 
04:12:10.130 --> 04:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:14.450 --> 04:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
no it says it says on page two it says
 
04:12:17.269 --> 04:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
the application the actual only mandate
 
04:12:19.370 --> 04:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage of such care if a
 
04:12:22.010 --> 04:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
primary care provider were to choose
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
this model
 
04:12:27.530 --> 04:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
okay so now what we're saying is that
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
all our Managed Care statutes are based
 
04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
upon the medical director the Board of
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
Medicine so what are the the appropriate
 
04:12:40.010 --> 04:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
protocols the appropriate different
 
04:12:42.769 --> 04:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
behavioral methods but now we're
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
mandating one
 
04:12:48.170 --> 04:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
if a physician chooses it
 
04:12:51.170 --> 04:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
okay the last thing you want is have
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
health insurance companies to start
 
04:12:54.650 --> 04:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
saying no we're not going to use that
 
04:12:56.510 --> 04:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
physician because they've chosen
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
something that we don't think is
 
04:13:01.550 --> 04:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate manner of care may I so I'm
 
04:13:03.889 --> 04:13:03.899 align:start position:0%
just asking can't we just turn this into
 
04:13:05.630 --> 04:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
a May
 
04:13:08.450 --> 04:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
this just say they can do this method
 
04:13:10.490 --> 04:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
that we're being supportive of the
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
concept of this care
 
04:13:16.070 --> 04:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay and that yes it is a is a it is a
 
04:13:18.410 --> 04:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
conversation between the primary care
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
physician and the insurance company okay
 
04:13:23.450 --> 04:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
and that again this is where I'm talking
 
04:13:25.250 --> 04:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
about external review if the primary
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
care physician thinks this is the
 
04:13:29.450 --> 04:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate care for the patient to use
 
04:13:32.330 --> 04:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
this model yes then we have a system in
 
04:13:33.769 --> 04:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
place where they ask the insurance
 
04:13:33.779 --> 04:13:35.150 align:start position:0%
place where they ask the insurance
company

04:13:35.150 --> 04:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:13:36.530 --> 04:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
04:13:38.210 --> 04:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
and the insurance company can make a
 
04:13:40.250 --> 04:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
choice and say whether you know if not
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
then you have the external review which
 
04:13:44.689 --> 04:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
does is a whole process with outside
 
04:13:46.969 --> 04:13:46.979 align:start position:0%
external review where people come in and
 
04:13:48.950 --> 04:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
say and evaluate the case and say
 
04:13:51.290 --> 04:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
whether it was really appropriate to or
 
04:13:51.300 --> 04:13:52.189 align:start position:0%
whether it was really appropriate to or
not

04:13:52.189 --> 04:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:13:54.530 --> 04:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
so all I'm asking says is to just is
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
changing a couple words here from the
 
04:13:58.729 --> 04:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
ACT shall
 
04:13:58.739 --> 04:14:00.469 align:start position:0%
ACT shall
mandate

04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
04:14:02.929 --> 04:14:02.939 align:start position:0%
all right and then I was up here
 
04:14:04.610 --> 04:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
um where are you representative yeah I'm
 
04:14:06.650 --> 04:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
on page two yeah
 
04:14:08.570 --> 04:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
an application
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
and then up on on the top of the page
 
04:14:14.090 --> 04:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
insurance provider uh
 
04:14:16.729 --> 04:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
you shall okay line eight I guess
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
everybody's got the numbered one so if
 
04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
you print them on the computer so on
 
04:14:24.050 --> 04:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
page two line eight says yeah shall not
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
deny the coverage on the sole basis that
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
the service delivered through the
 
04:14:30.830 --> 04:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
primary care Behavior no no because
 
04:14:34.610 --> 04:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
that might not the the protocol the
 
04:14:37.130 --> 04:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
insurance company if they have their own
 
04:14:38.809 --> 04:14:38.819 align:start position:0%
they have their own
 
04:14:42.889 --> 04:14:42.899 align:start position:0%
uh medical director for psychology right
 
04:14:45.229 --> 04:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
so their their medical that that's the
 
04:14:48.110 --> 04:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
person who makes the call
 
04:14:51.170 --> 04:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
right so all I'm saying is is just let
 
04:14:53.389 --> 04:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
the process let what we use for
 
04:14:55.370 --> 04:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
everything else when it comes to our
 
04:14:56.750 --> 04:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
health insurance you know there's our
 
04:14:59.330 --> 04:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
benefits in terms of the process of the
 
04:15:01.250 --> 04:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
medical director the board of you know
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then with Consulting Department what
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
of what is what I get the generally
 
04:15:08.689 --> 04:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
accepted medical appropriate care
 
04:15:11.150 --> 04:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
is I think is the concept
 
04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
and all I'm asking is is change those
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
words rather than it being a mandate to
 
04:15:18.290 --> 04:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
being that okay this is something that
 
04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
can be done and I it would
 
04:15:25.309 --> 04:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
I could live with it
 
04:15:25.319 --> 04:15:27.790 align:start position:0%
I could live with it
wow

04:15:27.790 --> 04:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
wow
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
because we're not changing anything and
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
we are not we are not determining health
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
care for somebody else that's just not
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
we're yet you might say we know a lot
 
04:15:41.090 --> 04:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
about insurance but you know we've made
 
04:15:43.010 --> 04:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
mistakes when we come to mandates in the
 
04:15:43.020 --> 04:15:44.469 align:start position:0%
mistakes when we come to mandates in the
past

04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
past
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
yes so there's lots of things going on
 
04:15:49.849 --> 04:15:49.859 align:start position:0%
in those questions and there's lots of
 
04:15:52.429 --> 04:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
things going on so I had the opportunity
 
04:15:54.769 --> 04:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
to meet with Alex Feld Babel for the
 
04:15:55.809 --> 04:15:55.819 align:start position:0%
insurance department last week
 
04:15:59.210 --> 04:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
incredibly helpful in terms of helping
 
04:16:00.830 --> 04:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
me understand some of the questions that
 
04:16:02.050 --> 04:16:02.060 align:start position:0%
the committee had
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
I just drafted some changes to this bill
 
04:16:08.750 --> 04:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
okay that my client signed off on
 
04:16:10.670 --> 04:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday I shared it with
 
04:16:14.929 --> 04:16:14.939 align:start position:0%
um Point 32 and Anthem yesterday okay it
 
04:16:16.490 --> 04:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
was yesterday we haven't had a chance to
 
04:16:17.809 --> 04:16:17.819 align:start position:0%
get back together and talk about it
 
04:16:20.090 --> 04:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
again which we're planning to do to to
 
04:16:22.189 --> 04:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
talk about it what you're talking about
 
04:16:24.050 --> 04:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
was one of the things so the application
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
section was added in total by the that
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
Senate chair at the last minute we
 
04:16:31.070 --> 04:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
hadn't seen or vetted that language
 
04:16:33.229 --> 04:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
before she added it so that second
 
04:16:35.150 --> 04:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
sentence you're referring to we've
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
already talked to Anthem about just
 
04:16:38.110 --> 04:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
taking that entire second sentence out
 
04:16:42.590 --> 04:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's good good but you know this okay
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
so the other pieces that we think can
 
04:16:46.969 --> 04:16:46.979 align:start position:0%
tighten this bill up significantly but
 
04:16:49.490 --> 04:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
so let's have another subcommittee on
 
04:16:49.500 --> 04:16:50.929 align:start position:0%
so let's have another subcommittee on
this

04:16:50.929 --> 04:16:50.939 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:16:53.870 --> 04:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll do next Wednesday we'll
 
04:16:55.729 --> 04:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
actually representative Terry has a
 
04:16:55.739 --> 04:16:57.469 align:start position:0%
actually representative Terry has a
question

04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have another meeting yes
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
about this yes
 
04:17:04.429 --> 04:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
well well good because the longer this
 
04:17:06.830 --> 04:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
goes on the more questions occur to me
 
04:17:09.650 --> 04:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
such that I do not have enough sticks to
 
04:17:12.349 --> 04:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
shake at all of them as you know the
 
04:17:15.410 --> 04:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
saying goes shake a stick so but I've
 
04:17:18.349 --> 04:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
always wondered what it meant yes so uh
 
04:17:22.070 --> 04:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
but my question one of them at 20
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
minutes ago
 
04:17:25.490 --> 04:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
and let me go back to that one because
 
04:17:28.729 --> 04:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
now there are 19 more but we're talking
 
04:17:28.739 --> 04:17:29.809 align:start position:0%
now there are 19 more but we're talking
about

04:17:29.809 --> 04:17:29.819 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative Calabro is is is is in
 
04:17:35.570 --> 04:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
the emergency room and she wants to call
 
04:17:38.450 --> 04:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
down a psychologist to come and
 
04:17:41.450 --> 04:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
de-escalate a situation
 
04:17:45.410 --> 04:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
and perhaps get engaged in some behavior
 
04:17:48.410 --> 04:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
modification calm the person down maybe
 
04:17:50.570 --> 04:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
the person then
 
04:17:51.950 --> 04:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
um with the continuing care of the
 
04:17:54.170 --> 04:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
primary care physician collabro Dr
 
04:17:56.809 --> 04:17:56.819 align:start position:0%
Calabro May then see the need to refer
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
to a psychiatrist the problem here that
 
04:18:02.809 --> 04:18:02.819 align:start position:0%
is being described is one of money
 
04:18:06.710 --> 04:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
in insurance that the psychologists is
 
04:18:08.510 --> 04:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
is not getting paid
 
04:18:11.630 --> 04:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
and what I heard was that you have been
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
in conversations with insurance
 
04:18:15.950 --> 04:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
companies since October and have heard
 
04:18:17.330 --> 04:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
from them that they don't have a problem
 
04:18:19.969 --> 04:18:19.979 align:start position:0%
with this but that but they're not doing
 
04:18:24.410 --> 04:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
it right but so so the question is and I
 
04:18:26.269 --> 04:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
guess I've just been a parent too long I
 
04:18:28.010 --> 04:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
want to bring the other party in here
 
04:18:29.570 --> 04:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
and I want to hear from the insurance
 
04:18:32.929 --> 04:18:32.939 align:start position:0%
companies as to why it is that they
 
04:18:32.939 --> 04:18:33.849 align:start position:0%
companies as to why it is that they
haven't

04:18:33.849 --> 04:18:33.859 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
04:18:37.250 --> 04:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
rendered a decision
 
04:18:40.729 --> 04:18:40.739 align:start position:0%
that we can then deal with because we're
 
04:18:44.030 --> 04:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
here as legislators as a last resort if
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
all else fails
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I I'm not sure that all else has
 
04:18:50.750 --> 04:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
failed at this point because I'm not
 
04:18:54.050 --> 04:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
sure that the insurers have given us any
 
04:18:55.849 --> 04:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
reason whatsoever for why they're not
 
04:18:57.170 --> 04:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
04:18:58.910 --> 04:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
you're claiming that they're not doing
 
04:19:01.189 --> 04:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
it I don't dispute that but the question
 
04:19:04.610 --> 04:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
is why are they not admitting that
 
04:19:06.650 --> 04:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
they're not doing anything and telling
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
us why they're not doing anything that's
 
04:19:10.610 --> 04:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
what we need to hear from I mean you can
 
04:19:13.010 --> 04:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
pass this along second or third hand and
 
04:19:15.410 --> 04:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
it becomes interesting today because we
 
04:19:16.490 --> 04:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
are going to deal with this next
 
04:19:18.050 --> 04:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
Wednesday because the chair is going to
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
call another subcommittee meeting but I
 
04:19:21.590 --> 04:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
would love to hear from the insurance
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
companies as to why they're putting you
 
04:19:27.650 --> 04:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
and and Dr Calabro in this situation
 
04:19:29.870 --> 04:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
such that you're not happy you can have
 
04:19:32.150 --> 04:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
this model if you want to the question
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
is you're not getting certain parties or
 
04:19:36.530 --> 04:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
players are not getting paid and that's
 
04:19:38.210 --> 04:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
what we have to deal with and the
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
question is is it because there's an
 
04:19:42.050 --> 04:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
unwillingness on the part of insurance
 
04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
companies to do this and if so let them
 
04:19:46.309 --> 04:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
come forward and tell us that they're
 
04:19:48.050 --> 04:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
unwilling to do it and why they're
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
unwilling to do it let me be really
 
04:19:52.849 --> 04:19:52.859 align:start position:0%
clear I don't speak to the insurance
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
companies and so I was very careful to
 
04:19:57.469 --> 04:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
say that the insurance companies have
 
04:19:59.630 --> 04:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
told us that these Co they believe these
 
04:19:59.640 --> 04:20:00.290 align:start position:0%
told us that these Co they believe these
codes

04:20:00.290 --> 04:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
codes
 
04:20:03.170 --> 04:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
ought to are reimbursable they couldn't
 
04:20:05.150 --> 04:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
answer the question why they're not and
 
04:20:07.309 --> 04:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's been the conversation so they did
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
not support this they did not oppose the
 
04:20:12.769 --> 04:20:12.779 align:start position:0%
idea of this billing they're trying to
 
04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
get their arms around it that's why
 
04:20:16.910 --> 04:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
these conversations are ongoing I don't
 
04:20:18.530 --> 04:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
see the insurance companies at this
 
04:20:20.990 --> 04:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
point as unwilling participants I see
 
04:20:24.050 --> 04:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies as having Frank
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
conversations with us to the extent that
 
04:20:27.889 --> 04:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
they're able to since October
 
04:20:30.590 --> 04:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
yeah the other piece is my rocket
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
science I would disagree that this
 
04:20:34.130 --> 04:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
committee or this legislature is a
 
04:20:35.689 --> 04:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
quarter last but you saw it I believe
 
04:20:38.689 --> 04:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
this this Committee in this legislature
 
04:20:41.150 --> 04:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
set public policy that then the private
 
04:20:43.490 --> 04:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
entities follow and that's that's the
 
04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
reason we're here if need be because
 
04:20:47.450 --> 04:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
something's not working the question is
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
the Florida medicine I'm sorry this is
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
this is not we don't set this kind of
 
04:20:54.349 --> 04:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
policy this is this is protocols
 
04:20:57.410 --> 04:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
practice of the medical system that our
 
04:21:00.229 --> 04:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
job is not to intervene in that level so
 
04:21:01.309 --> 04:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
would you like the board of psychology
 
04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
to say that um I want to hear that the
 
04:21:06.769 --> 04:21:06.779 align:start position:0%
external review didn't that they took it
 
04:21:08.809 --> 04:21:08.819 align:start position:0%
to external review and here's the
 
04:21:11.090 --> 04:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
refusal letter and it's let's find out
 
04:21:14.510 --> 04:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
exactly get down to the Brass tax on why
 
04:21:16.250 --> 04:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
and why and who's saying telling them
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to try to get that answer from
 
04:21:19.969 --> 04:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
me that's what I'm interested yes
 
04:21:19.979 --> 04:21:21.469 align:start position:0%
me that's what I'm interested yes
representative

04:21:21.469 --> 04:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
um you're talking about external review
 
04:21:24.889 --> 04:21:24.899 align:start position:0%
you don't mean at the time that there's
 
04:21:26.750 --> 04:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
a crisis
 
04:21:30.410 --> 04:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
the external review is I have to uh when
 
04:21:33.290 --> 04:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
the the paperwork is filed and sent in
 
04:21:36.349 --> 04:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and to get reimbursement yeah and
 
04:21:38.929 --> 04:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
the insurance company declines it
 
04:21:42.170 --> 04:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
okay then that we external review
 
04:21:44.269 --> 04:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
happens within a month
 
04:21:47.330 --> 04:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:49.070 --> 04:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know he's saying there's a denial
 
04:21:52.969 --> 04:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
and I I'm just shocked but shocked I
 
04:21:55.070 --> 04:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
looked at the external review I'm saying
 
04:21:58.849 --> 04:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
that our psychologists when surveyed
 
04:22:01.130 --> 04:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
many of them said they did not submit
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursement at all when asked why they
 
04:22:05.510 --> 04:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
didn't submit reimbursement they said
 
04:22:08.090 --> 04:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
that historically they've been denied so
 
04:22:10.370 --> 04:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know what historically means and
 
04:22:12.410 --> 04:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
I would have to try to figure that out
 
04:22:14.689 --> 04:22:14.699 align:start position:0%
look at so why wouldn't we want to make
 
04:22:16.490 --> 04:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
it easier for them to get real no no no
 
04:22:19.790 --> 04:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
no no no no no we have a system you come
 
04:22:22.969 --> 04:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
to us when the system is failing if
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
somebody is fail is not is refusing to
 
04:22:28.490 --> 04:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
file it that's not our problem you know
 
04:22:29.150 --> 04:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
I don't think they're talking about
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
filing filing filing they never filed it
 
04:22:34.490 --> 04:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
we stopped filing for it because we were
 
04:22:37.370 --> 04:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
asked to stop you have a letter that
 
04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
says no accounts receipt accounts
 
04:22:41.450 --> 04:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
payable gives us calls and says we're
 
04:22:43.250 --> 04:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
not getting paid for this stop filing
 
04:22:44.809 --> 04:22:44.819 align:start position:0%
for it it's just making extra work for
 
04:22:44.819 --> 04:22:45.530 align:start position:0%
for it it's just making extra work for
us

04:22:45.530 --> 04:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:22:49.670 --> 04:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh again that means there was a refuels
 
04:22:53.389 --> 04:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
letter somebody got their a list of
 
04:22:55.849 --> 04:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
benefits and said it was refused Mr
 
04:22:58.750 --> 04:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah
 
04:23:02.030 --> 04:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
the insurance company is here could we
 
04:23:05.330 --> 04:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
have them come up and tell us why we're
 
04:23:08.150 --> 04:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
the insurance company Okay who wants to
 
04:23:10.370 --> 04:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
do it
 
04:23:13.070 --> 04:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay here we go so we got Harvard and
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
Anthem Mr chairman while there is an
 
04:23:16.250 --> 04:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
approach being made and there's a moment
 
04:23:19.790 --> 04:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
I also circled certain uh and maybe this
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
is what's being worked on I I circled
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
certain words and phrases with questions
 
04:23:26.870 --> 04:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
consultation with a physician the
 
04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
question was rayed what does this mean
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
in person or on the phone and then I
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
circled appropriate CPT codes what are
 
04:23:37.849 --> 04:23:37.859 align:start position:0%
appropriate CPT codes so this begs for
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
retaining but I I I'm very eager to hear
 
04:23:47.170 --> 04:23:47.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:50.269 --> 04:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
you did ask for retaining when in your
 
04:23:53.650 --> 04:23:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:57.170 --> 04:23:57.180 align:start position:0%
okay so so we have been engaged in
 
04:23:58.910 --> 04:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
conversations with New Hampshire psych
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
Association I would clarify that in the
 
04:24:03.769 --> 04:24:03.779 align:start position:0%
fall I was asked sort of in a vacuum for
 
04:24:05.870 --> 04:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
a list of codes not knowing what it was
 
04:24:07.969 --> 04:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
going to be used for and so I think it's
 
04:24:09.710 --> 04:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
a slight mischaracterization to make it
 
04:24:11.150 --> 04:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
sound like we've been working on really
 
04:24:12.889 --> 04:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
drilling down in the issue since October
 
04:24:16.130 --> 04:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
it's really more recently and as I said
 
04:24:17.570 --> 04:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
last time I was here
 
04:24:19.010 --> 04:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
this is very similar to the
 
04:24:21.110 --> 04:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
collaborative care model where providers
 
04:24:23.689 --> 04:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
were not using the codes we sat around a
 
04:24:25.729 --> 04:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
table with the insurance department and
 
04:24:27.710 --> 04:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders and we figured out
 
04:24:29.689 --> 04:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
what the problem was it was a practical
 
04:24:32.150 --> 04:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
issue I think this is very similar where
 
04:24:34.490 --> 04:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
providers aren't using the codes how can
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
we reimburse for them so I think there's
 
04:24:38.210 --> 04:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
probably education that needs to happen
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
there might need to be updates to
 
04:24:42.349 --> 04:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
contracts but conceptually this is not
 
04:24:44.570 --> 04:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
an issue of carriers not wanting to
 
04:24:46.610 --> 04:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
cover it that's just my short response I
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if you
 
04:24:51.530 --> 04:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
uh and so again I'm kind of coming in
 
04:24:53.210 --> 04:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
new to this I do know that Harvard
 
04:24:55.910 --> 04:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim part of 0.32 Health uh much like
 
04:24:57.530 --> 04:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
Anthem had discussions with the
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
association back last fall
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
um about this um I wasn't part of that
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
and now my understanding is that these
 
04:25:10.130 --> 04:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
are things that we think are covered uh
 
04:25:12.050 --> 04:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
the providers seem to think that they're
 
04:25:12.060 --> 04:25:13.309 align:start position:0%
the providers seem to think that they're
not

04:25:13.309 --> 04:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's one of the biggest
 
04:25:16.670 --> 04:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
disputes and so
 
04:25:19.490 --> 04:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
um I talked with Mr dejoy earlier and
 
04:25:21.050 --> 04:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
we'll continue with chat and I asked to
 
04:25:23.330 --> 04:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
be involved with that because I not
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
being part of the discussions back in
 
04:25:26.870 --> 04:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
October November I I don't know but
 
04:25:28.429 --> 04:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
those some of the questions we have is
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
what does this involve and we think
 
04:25:32.150 --> 04:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
these are covered and show us that
 
04:25:33.410 --> 04:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
they're not or tell us where they're not
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
so we can check it out
 
04:25:37.790 --> 04:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman anybody has a question
 
04:25:40.130 --> 04:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
yes representative post yes thank you Mr
 
04:25:43.010 --> 04:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
chairman um so I have a question
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
um can I get your names everybody keeps
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
coming up without a name sorry about
 
04:25:48.290 --> 04:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
that I'm Sabrina Dunlap director of
 
04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
government relations for Anthem okay
 
04:25:53.090 --> 04:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm Peter Bragdon I'm with uh party
 
04:25:55.070 --> 04:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
strategies here in Concord representing
 
04:25:56.510 --> 04:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
Harper Pilgrim Healthcare a part of
 
04:25:59.030 --> 04:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
Point 32 health thank you so my question
 
04:26:01.910 --> 04:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
to you is between think and no you said
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
you think
 
04:26:06.290 --> 04:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
but you should know that they're covered
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
or not you shouldn't have to think
 
04:26:10.370 --> 04:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
whether it's covered if you have it in a
 
04:26:10.380 --> 04:26:11.330 align:start position:0%
whether it's covered if you have it in a
policy

04:26:11.330 --> 04:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
policy
 
04:26:13.010 --> 04:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
I assume it would be there is that
 
04:26:13.020 --> 04:26:14.929 align:start position:0%
I assume it would be there is that
correct

04:26:14.929 --> 04:26:14.939 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:26:17.090 --> 04:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
again I'm just coming into this really
 
04:26:19.130 --> 04:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
based on the public hearing from was it
 
04:26:21.170 --> 04:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
last week or the week before so it is
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
all new to me my understanding is these
 
04:26:26.269 --> 04:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
are things that are covered but again
 
04:26:27.889 --> 04:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
every situation is different you'll give
 
04:26:30.170 --> 04:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
in my view I'd like to have and there
 
04:26:31.729 --> 04:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
was a good case example given earlier
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
today of here's a situation in an
 
04:26:36.349 --> 04:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
emergency room bringing a psychologist
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
to de-escalate right that's a concrete
 
04:26:41.149 --> 04:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
example and so bring up that in
 
04:26:42.649 --> 04:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
discussion and say okay is this covered
 
04:26:44.090 --> 04:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
or is it not and that's pretty easy to
 
04:26:45.170 --> 04:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
answer that I don't know that sitting
 
04:26:47.090 --> 04:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
here I'm a lobbyist I'm not a health
 
04:26:49.370 --> 04:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
insurance person but that's one of the
 
04:26:50.570 --> 04:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
things I want to talk about
 
04:26:52.729 --> 04:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
I can say I did look at specific codes
 
04:26:54.830 --> 04:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
there's there's many and I think part of
 
04:26:56.510 --> 04:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
the challenge is there's there appears
 
04:26:58.490 --> 04:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
to be some disagreement around what
 
04:27:00.110 --> 04:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
quotes even qualify as being part of
 
04:27:01.729 --> 04:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
this model so I can say I know we
 
04:27:03.410 --> 04:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
covered a cover a number of the codes
 
04:27:05.090 --> 04:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
that come in this list there might be
 
04:27:07.010 --> 04:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
disagreement among providers among the
 
04:27:08.389 --> 04:27:08.399 align:start position:0%

foreign
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
okay so what's really important to me is
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to pass legislation
 
04:27:25.010 --> 04:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
telling me something it is supposed to
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
make a bright line to clarify what
 
04:27:30.530 --> 04:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
people think or don't think or know or
 
04:27:33.530 --> 04:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
don't know and so that a proper process
 
04:27:36.229 --> 04:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
is occurring because otherwise all we're
 
04:27:37.910 --> 04:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
just doing is opening up a new can of
 
04:27:39.889 --> 04:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
worms that they'll be back next year
 
04:27:42.349 --> 04:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
saying it it didn't work or no
 
04:27:44.870 --> 04:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted or we don't know and then
 
04:27:46.670 --> 04:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
let alone the department having to try
 
04:27:50.809 --> 04:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to enforce it so so it
 
04:27:52.429 --> 04:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
is more important to they need that we
 
04:27:54.889 --> 04:27:54.899 align:start position:0%
we figure out how to referee through
 
04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
this and get through this and get this
 
04:27:59.389 --> 04:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
done right so uh we definitely have time
 
04:28:02.210 --> 04:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
so we can have another meeting and I
 
04:28:04.630 --> 04:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
would urge the parties to get together
 
04:28:07.490 --> 04:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
and have the department uh kind of help
 
04:28:10.910 --> 04:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
these people through and it's and make
 
04:28:13.130 --> 04:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
sure that if there are codes involved we
 
04:28:15.410 --> 04:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
know which ones they are and and maybe a
 
04:28:18.769 --> 04:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
bulletin would go out I guess to to make
 
04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
sure that that there's enough people are
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
well informed and how this is supposed
 
04:28:24.830 --> 04:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
04:28:24.840 --> 04:28:25.969 align:start position:0%
to be done
okay

04:28:25.969 --> 04:28:25.979 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:28:32.389 --> 04:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:37.070 --> 04:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:38.410 --> 04:28:38.420 align:start position:0%
veto what
 
04:28:40.630 --> 04:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
to talk about it
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
oh you want to just retain it
 
04:28:49.370 --> 04:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:53.530 --> 04:28:53.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:56.330 --> 04:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
yeah you gotta put the mic in and uh
 
04:28:58.010 --> 04:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
Chris nicolopolis insurance commissioner
 
04:28:59.809 --> 04:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
and I'm excited about collaborative care
 
04:29:01.969 --> 04:29:01.979 align:start position:0%
but a real collaborative care practice
 
04:29:04.429 --> 04:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
has to be intentional it can't just be a
 
04:29:05.689 --> 04:29:05.699 align:start position:0%
primary care practice or an emergency
 
04:29:08.210 --> 04:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
room practice who happens to call a
 
04:29:10.510 --> 04:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
referral for a psych
 
04:29:12.889 --> 04:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
it is an intentional practice where we
 
04:29:14.809 --> 04:29:14.819 align:start position:0%
bring in all the experts together to
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
care for the patient together there you
 
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
go and that should be happening with
 
04:29:20.330 --> 04:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
your contract negotiation as part of
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
your individual contract negotiation
 
04:29:24.769 --> 04:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
with the health carriers I was really
 
04:29:26.929 --> 04:29:26.939 align:start position:0%
excited uh I think it was a few months
 
04:29:28.670 --> 04:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
ago but my memory such it was probably
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
eight months ago Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
came in and they're rolling out this
 
04:29:33.769 --> 04:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
program they're rolling out a true
 
04:29:36.110 --> 04:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
collaborative care where they're and
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's not just for the emergency rooms
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
but it's for the total care so those
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
people are working together and that
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
they can build those calls between each
 
04:29:44.389 --> 04:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
other because that's what we're talking
 
04:29:46.490 --> 04:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
about here the individual meetings with
 
04:29:49.729 --> 04:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
the patients are covered this is when
 
04:29:51.290 --> 04:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
they call and say let me talk to you
 
04:29:53.149 --> 04:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
about what's happening and I need you to
 
04:29:54.649 --> 04:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
understand what we might have worked
 
04:29:56.510 --> 04:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
through today
 
04:29:58.910 --> 04:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we need this bill today
 
04:30:01.429 --> 04:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
I think a collaborative care practice
 
04:30:03.649 --> 04:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
that wants to entertain a contract with
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
a provider can do that we're hearing
 
04:30:06.910 --> 04:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
that they want to do it and I believe
 
04:30:09.229 --> 04:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
that we'll find out that in the long run
 
04:30:10.969 --> 04:30:10.979 align:start position:0%
it's cheaper having all these people
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
work together rather than a bunch of
 
04:30:15.229 --> 04:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
individual diagnosis
 
04:30:17.929 --> 04:30:17.939 align:start position:0%
um if you're telling me that somebody
 
04:30:20.090 --> 04:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
who's being brought into this
 
04:30:23.149 --> 04:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
relationship isn't able to contract I
 
04:30:24.950 --> 04:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
can make calls I'm happy to work with
 
04:30:27.889 --> 04:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
the folks behind us on those things
 
04:30:29.450 --> 04:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
um but I don't know that there's a
 
04:30:31.010 --> 04:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
problem today
 
04:30:32.330 --> 04:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
um I've been working Alex has been
 
04:30:33.530 --> 04:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
primarily running this for the
 
04:30:33.540 --> 04:30:34.550 align:start position:0%
primarily running this for the
Department

04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:30:34.560 --> 04:30:36.050 align:start position:0%
Department
um

04:30:36.050 --> 04:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:39.590 --> 04:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
Mr Chicken so if I I want to be clear
 
04:30:42.769 --> 04:30:42.779 align:start position:0%
about this you're informing us that
 
04:30:46.330 --> 04:30:46.340 align:start position:0%
there are developments occurring
 
04:30:49.610 --> 04:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
that are moving in the direction of
 
04:30:51.950 --> 04:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
establishing collaborative care models
 
04:30:54.290 --> 04:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
that would include the one that's in
 
04:30:56.750 --> 04:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
Focus here in this bill
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
and those conversations are taking place
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
at a place such as Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
04:31:06.769 --> 04:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
and with insurers to put this in place
 
04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
and it's happening currently yes
 
04:31:12.290 --> 04:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative Rose thank you when
 
04:31:16.910 --> 04:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
you said I can make a call what did that
 
04:31:19.370 --> 04:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
mean so if you if you told me that
 
04:31:21.290 --> 04:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
outside of Dartmouth outside of a
 
04:31:22.729 --> 04:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
contract with
 
04:31:24.889 --> 04:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
um there were
 
04:31:27.170 --> 04:31:27.180 align:start position:0%
uh Independence
 
04:31:28.969 --> 04:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
I always get this wrong psychologists
 
04:31:31.189 --> 04:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
who are being called in as a reference
 
04:31:34.010 --> 04:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
to an emergency room
 
04:31:36.290 --> 04:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
and they're not able to build that
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
they're told by their billing practice
 
04:31:40.370 --> 04:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
don't bill so first I would look at what
 
04:31:42.649 --> 04:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
is uh so I hear that and I think well we
 
04:31:43.729 --> 04:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
probably want to incentivize
 
04:31:45.710 --> 04:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
psychologists for taking those calls
 
04:31:48.410 --> 04:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
from the emergency room doctor probably
 
04:31:49.490 --> 04:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
um and there are a couple things I'd
 
04:31:51.290 --> 04:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
want to look at one what's the contract
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
between the emergency room and the
 
04:31:56.030 --> 04:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
provider because it may be in all kind
 
04:31:58.670 --> 04:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
of all-encompassing contract it may not
 
04:32:01.550 --> 04:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
be uh and whether or not that provider
 
04:32:03.950 --> 04:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
is convinced Network the one that was
 
04:32:07.729 --> 04:32:07.739 align:start position:0%
built it would be short-sighted to tell
 
04:32:09.349 --> 04:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
those people who are making themselves
 
04:32:11.389 --> 04:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
available for those emergency calls that
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
you can't be billing
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
I I know these folks's phone numbers and
 
04:32:18.830 --> 04:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
I know their bosses numbers we find our
 
04:32:20.269 --> 04:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
ways through that there are times where
 
04:32:21.649 --> 04:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
I make those calls and they say Chris
 
04:32:22.849 --> 04:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
that treatment they want to do isn't
 
04:32:24.670 --> 04:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
medically necessary or isn't appropriate
 
04:32:27.830 --> 04:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay you know that's right and there are
 
04:32:28.969 --> 04:32:28.979 align:start position:0%
times where they say thank you we'll
 
04:32:30.050 --> 04:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
bring it to our team and make sure we
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
modify our practices such that we're not
 
04:32:33.290 --> 04:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
getting in the way of it so you don't
 
04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
call Tony Soprano because I don't okay I
 
04:32:35.520 --> 04:32:37.130 align:start position:0%
call Tony Soprano because I don't okay I
don't

04:32:37.130 --> 04:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:32:39.050 --> 04:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
um it's one you know one of the things
 
04:32:41.389 --> 04:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
with in New Hampshire these regulated
 
04:32:43.550 --> 04:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
entities we work pretty closely together
 
04:32:47.090 --> 04:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
both the hospitals and in the agents and
 
04:32:48.830 --> 04:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
the 5 000 consumers that call us each
 
04:32:48.840 --> 04:32:50.090 align:start position:0%
the 5 000 consumers that call us each
year

04:32:50.090 --> 04:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:32:52.610 --> 04:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
um you know they don't they don't they
 
04:32:55.969 --> 04:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
want to fix these problems and issues
 
04:32:57.769 --> 04:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
and developments as the practice changes
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
in a way that's appropriate especially
 
04:33:01.490 --> 04:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
when it saves the money
 
04:33:04.250 --> 04:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and having a bill that my experts
 
04:33:05.929 --> 04:33:05.939 align:start position:0%
can't tell me how we would enforce
 
04:33:12.890 --> 04:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
the only comment I would make is you
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
made a suggestion about holding off one
 
04:33:21.170 --> 04:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
week right well and I'm going to ask a
 
04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
certain person whether he's
 
04:33:25.789 --> 04:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
where we're at now well it seemed to me
 
04:33:28.010 --> 04:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
that was a good idea because there is a
 
04:33:30.170 --> 04:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
discrepancy here and maybe we ought to
 
04:33:32.750 --> 04:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
get both sides to come up with the
 
04:33:32.760 --> 04:33:34.010 align:start position:0%
get both sides to come up with the
details

04:33:34.010 --> 04:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
details
 
04:33:36.349 --> 04:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
before we make any decision as to what
 
04:33:37.789 --> 04:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
we might do
 
04:33:39.830 --> 04:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
right just pull it away I also had a
 
04:33:43.310 --> 04:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
call for not doing it next week so so
 
04:33:46.609 --> 04:33:46.619 align:start position:0%
John uh thank you
 
04:33:46.619 --> 04:33:53.029 align:start position:0%
John uh thank you
Chris

04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
given that you just heard that the
 
04:33:57.551 --> 04:33:57.561 align:start position:0%
insurance department is highly motivated
 
04:34:01.970 --> 04:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:04.131 --> 04:34:04.141 align:start position:0%
um is it passing legislation really
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
important to you or is it willing worth
 
04:34:09.470 --> 04:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
waiting till September and hear what's
 
04:34:11.510 --> 04:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
what's happened at that point and decide
 
04:34:14.209 --> 04:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
whether we need legislation
 
04:34:16.490 --> 04:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
I'm very excited I'm very excited to
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
hear the commission of statements
 
04:34:21.289 --> 04:34:21.299 align:start position:0%
my client this is not my bill just to be
 
04:34:23.090 --> 04:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
clear well you're like like I'm the
 
04:34:27.529 --> 04:34:27.539 align:start position:0%
lobbyist my client has asked me to try
 
04:34:29.689 --> 04:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
to push this bill through okay I can
 
04:34:31.369 --> 04:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
certainly talk to my client fair enough
 
04:34:33.590 --> 04:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
explain what happened today and come
 
04:34:35.330 --> 04:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
back but I would still like to continue
 
04:34:37.429 --> 04:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
the meetings with Point 32 and Anthem
 
04:34:39.769 --> 04:34:39.779 align:start position:0%
around the potential for Amendment right
 
04:34:41.750 --> 04:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
just to keep that moving forward okay
 
04:34:44.330 --> 04:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
bless Mr chairman yeah you've already
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
told us that you're working on changes
 
04:34:50.090 --> 04:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
as a result of what you are I mean so
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
this is we don't want to rush this and
 
04:34:54.289 --> 04:34:54.299 align:start position:0%
then rush to do something that we don't
 
04:34:57.769 --> 04:34:57.779 align:start position:0%
really need to do if it turns out that
 
04:34:59.929 --> 04:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
this can get fixed without having to
 
04:35:03.051 --> 04:35:03.061 align:start position:0%
have legislation passed so September
 
04:35:05.209 --> 04:35:05.219 align:start position:0%
that you know we're all you know before
 
04:35:07.730 --> 04:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
you know it'll be September that's why
 
04:35:08.810 --> 04:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
I'm very glad you don't need to have
 
04:35:10.330 --> 04:35:10.340 align:start position:0%
this out of committee until the 31st
 
04:35:14.330 --> 04:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
right thank you okay thank you all right
 
04:35:14.340 --> 04:35:15.650 align:start position:0%
right thank you okay thank you all right
so

04:35:15.650 --> 04:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
we you okay
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
for a little bit of a delay here okay
 
04:35:22.369 --> 04:35:22.379 align:start position:0%
all right so we will uh close the
 
04:35:24.490 --> 04:35:24.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on a hearing on this bill
 
04:35:33.949 --> 04:35:33.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:53.390 --> 04:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
all right so Terry post telly
 
04:35:55.609 --> 04:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
hello bro
 
04:35:55.619 --> 04:35:57.349 align:start position:0%
hello bro
uh

04:35:57.349 --> 04:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:01.010 --> 04:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
spear is replacing Vincent and
 
04:36:01.020 --> 04:36:04.070 align:start position:0%
spear is replacing Vincent and
McAleer

04:36:04.070 --> 04:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:07.070 --> 04:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
is replacing Gibbs
 
04:36:07.080 --> 04:36:09.051 align:start position:0%
is replacing Gibbs
and

04:36:09.051 --> 04:36:09.061 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:09.061 --> 04:36:11.029 align:start position:0%
and
Burrows

04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
Burrows
 
04:36:11.039 --> 04:36:13.789 align:start position:0%
Burrows
okay

04:36:13.789 --> 04:36:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:27.410 --> 04:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:31.789 --> 04:36:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:34.131 --> 04:36:34.141 align:start position:0%
did you tell Spear and Vincent not to
 
04:36:36.109 --> 04:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
come in so that you could no I was going
 
04:36:39.170 --> 04:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
to do this anyway okay
 
04:36:43.789 --> 04:36:43.799 align:start position:0%
because I am a sponsor on this bill oh
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and because of respect
 
04:36:50.631 --> 04:36:50.641 align:start position:0%
the senator Rosenwald
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
I spent hours investigating this
 
04:36:57.529 --> 04:36:57.539 align:start position:0%
and I have some conclusions
 
04:36:59.869 --> 04:36:59.879 align:start position:0%
that I think are very important before
 
04:37:03.650 --> 04:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:05.449 --> 04:37:05.459 align:start position:0%
this is my trade study but I don't want
 
04:37:06.590 --> 04:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
to read that because it'll make
 
04:37:08.510 --> 04:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
everybody crazy
 
04:37:14.090 --> 04:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.529 --> 04:37:18.539 align:start position:0%
ACA was put into law in 2010.
 
04:37:22.910 --> 04:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
it got enacted upon in 2012.
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
insurance companies I mean states are
 
04:37:27.289 --> 04:37:27.299 align:start position:0%
required to have implementations by
 
04:37:27.299 --> 04:37:29.090 align:start position:0%
required to have implementations by
2014.

04:37:29.090 --> 04:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
2014.
 
04:37:32.390 --> 04:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
of the 18 states that have implemented
 
04:37:35.390 --> 04:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
state-based Insurance estate-based
 
04:37:38.209 --> 04:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
exchanges of the 18
 
04:37:41.750 --> 04:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
17 of them did it for one reason and one
 
04:37:43.970 --> 04:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
reason only and that was to expand
 
04:37:46.490 --> 04:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
Health Care in their states
 
04:37:50.090 --> 04:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
the outlier was Idaho they did it
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
for ideological reasons and I say that
 
04:37:52.561 --> 04:37:53.750 align:start position:0%
for ideological reasons and I say that
kindly

04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
kindly
 
04:37:55.369 --> 04:37:55.379 align:start position:0%
they did it because they wanted to
 
04:37:56.810 --> 04:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
isolate themselves from the federal
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
government flat out they had no
 
04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
intention of doing anything about
 
04:38:00.600 --> 04:38:01.849 align:start position:0%
intention of doing anything about
insurance

04:38:01.849 --> 04:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:38:03.890 --> 04:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
anything past the minimum all right so
 
04:38:05.689 --> 04:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
they're the outlier
 
04:38:07.551 --> 04:38:07.561 align:start position:0%
and they have been in trouble with the
 
04:38:10.670 --> 04:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
feds quite a few times over the years
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
and so they we can't include them in the
 
04:38:13.199 --> 04:38:14.869 align:start position:0%
and so they we can't include them in the
analysis

04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
04:38:17.209 --> 04:38:17.219 align:start position:0%
of the states that implemented it four
 
04:38:18.349 --> 04:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
of them
 
04:38:21.529 --> 04:38:21.539 align:start position:0%
New York Massachusetts California
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
and Maryland already had very extensive
 
04:38:26.209 --> 04:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
plans in place had extensive medical
 
04:38:28.490 --> 04:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
capabilities in place
 
04:38:30.769 --> 04:38:30.779 align:start position:0%
and they understood their constituents
 
04:38:33.051 --> 04:38:33.061 align:start position:0%
and they understood the problems as a
 
04:38:34.609 --> 04:38:34.619 align:start position:0%
result of that they were very early
 
04:38:36.769 --> 04:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
adopters because they were very early
 
04:38:38.689 --> 04:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
adopters they were able to take care of
 
04:38:41.689 --> 04:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
a lot of federal subsidies and because
 
04:38:43.609 --> 04:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
they were able to start early and
 
04:38:45.769 --> 04:38:45.779 align:start position:0%
because they knew what they had their
 
04:38:48.410 --> 04:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
implementation was very straightforward
 
04:38:50.631 --> 04:38:50.641 align:start position:0%
none of them did the implementations
 
04:38:53.390 --> 04:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
themselves the actual nuts and bolts of
 
04:38:55.551 --> 04:38:55.561 align:start position:0%
setting the software they hired people
 
04:38:56.990 --> 04:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
but because they knew what they were
 
04:38:57.000 --> 04:38:57.890 align:start position:0%
but because they knew what they were
doing

04:38:57.890 --> 04:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
they wrote specifications that were very
 
04:39:00.119 --> 04:39:01.070 align:start position:0%
they wrote specifications that were very
clear

04:39:01.070 --> 04:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:39:02.929 --> 04:39:02.939 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that that software
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
went very straightforward
 
04:39:07.609 --> 04:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
the next Nine States
 
04:39:09.529 --> 04:39:09.539 align:start position:0%
no I'm sorry the next
 
04:39:11.689 --> 04:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
nine states right because I know it
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't count the next nine states did
 
04:39:16.189 --> 04:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
not understand their problems and they
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
had three areas of problems
 
04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
they had problems with not understanding
 
04:39:22.970 --> 04:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
what their problems Healthcare problem
 
04:39:24.410 --> 04:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
was they knew they wanted to get better
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
but they didn't know exactly what they
 
04:39:28.730 --> 04:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
wanted to do mostly what they wanted to
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
do was subsidize the
 
04:39:31.920 --> 04:39:33.109 align:start position:0%
do was subsidize the
um

04:39:33.109 --> 04:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:35.570 --> 04:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
premiums bring the premiums down and
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
subsidize insurance companies and plans
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
so they could get the uh deductibles
 
04:39:40.560 --> 04:39:41.390 align:start position:0%
so they could get the uh deductibles
down

04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:39:43.130 --> 04:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
they didn't know how to get there and
 
04:39:46.010 --> 04:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
they didn't know precisely how to reach
 
04:39:47.990 --> 04:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
the information they needed and as a
 
04:39:49.850 --> 04:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
result of that their requirements were
 
04:39:51.170 --> 04:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
very poor
 
04:39:52.490 --> 04:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
they didn't know how to get the output
 
04:39:53.690 --> 04:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
they didn't have the input this is a
 
04:39:56.090 --> 04:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
systems engineering problem flat out and
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
as a result of that they churned and
 
04:40:00.590 --> 04:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
churned and churned and this software
 
04:40:03.470 --> 04:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
was a mess and it took in some cases it
 
04:40:05.930 --> 04:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
took five more years to straighten it
 
04:40:05.940 --> 04:40:07.190 align:start position:0%
took five more years to straighten it
out

04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
how many for that purpose nine people
 
04:40:11.930 --> 04:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
nine states in that group and I can give
 
04:40:13.550 --> 04:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
you a lot of details about what they
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
turned on
 
04:40:16.910 --> 04:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
that was one problem they had the other
 
04:40:19.570 --> 04:40:19.580 align:start position:0%
problem that they had was that the uh
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
they didn't pass the right laws you
 
04:40:24.530 --> 04:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
can't have any success if your
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
brother-in-law is the one you hired to
 
04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
manage the process which is what some
 
04:40:31.010 --> 04:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
states did
 
04:40:31.020 --> 04:40:33.948 align:start position:0%
states did
what

04:40:33.948 --> 04:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
the other problem that they had was as a
 
04:40:38.930 --> 04:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
result of the failure of those first two
 
04:40:40.610 --> 04:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
problems they now have political
 
04:40:40.620 --> 04:40:41.690 align:start position:0%
problems they now have political
problems

04:40:41.690 --> 04:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
problems
 
04:40:43.550 --> 04:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough money we have too
 
04:40:44.690 --> 04:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
much money we don't know what we're
 
04:40:46.610 --> 04:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
doing nothing is working and it took
 
04:40:48.288 --> 04:40:48.298 align:start position:0%
five years
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
in fact Rhode Island was kind of
 
04:40:52.850 --> 04:40:52.860 align:start position:0%
impressive in the fact that they
 
04:40:55.730 --> 04:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
actually get noted as the most improved
 
04:40:58.368 --> 04:40:58.378 align:start position:0%
Health Care system or exchange system of
 
04:41:01.130 --> 04:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
estate type they went from a ridiculous
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
five years
 
04:41:06.770 --> 04:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
that they now have 3.5 percent uninsured
 
04:41:06.780 --> 04:41:09.788 align:start position:0%
that they now have 3.5 percent uninsured
people

04:41:09.788 --> 04:41:09.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:12.350 --> 04:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
impressive and just so you know what the
 
04:41:14.810 --> 04:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
comparison is Massachusetts who was an
 
04:41:17.990 --> 04:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
early adopter uh has 2.5 percent
 
04:41:18.000 --> 04:41:20.448 align:start position:0%
early adopter uh has 2.5 percent
uninsured

04:41:20.448 --> 04:41:20.458 align:start position:0%
uninsured
 
04:41:23.690 --> 04:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
Matt uh Maryland was the first adopter
 
04:41:25.850 --> 04:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
they actually had a plan they actually
 
04:41:27.890 --> 04:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
had an exchange up and running as a
 
04:41:31.010 --> 04:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
prototype in 2011. way before anybody
 
04:41:31.020 --> 04:41:33.650 align:start position:0%
prototype in 2011. way before anybody
else

04:41:33.650 --> 04:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:35.628 --> 04:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
so those are the problems that they had
 
04:41:38.270 --> 04:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
and why they churned for five years and
 
04:41:39.890 --> 04:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
why the software was very difficult
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have the
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
requirements and they didn't know their
 
04:41:44.330 --> 04:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
inputs and they didn't know their
 
04:41:44.340 --> 04:41:46.070 align:start position:0%
inputs and they didn't know their
outputs

04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
outputs
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
then we had the late adopters
 
04:41:50.810 --> 04:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
in 2000 under the Trump Administration
 
04:41:53.930 --> 04:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
as you know everybody knows they started
 
04:41:56.208 --> 04:41:56.218 align:start position:0%
cutting back on Health Care they got rid
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
of uh tax Abate tax credits and a bunch
 
04:42:00.830 --> 04:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
of other things that they did to try and
 
04:42:03.050 --> 04:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
sabotage the plan and in fact they went
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court and they tried to
 
04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
vote it out and we all know about the
 
04:42:06.718 --> 04:42:08.390 align:start position:0%
vote it out and we all know about the
McCain

04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
McCain
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
savior of ACA
 
04:42:14.750 --> 04:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
those States though by that time they
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
had the education to know how to
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
implement the plan so they went to a
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
state-based plan mostly to subsidized
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
premiums so they can get more people
 
04:42:24.890 --> 04:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
insured because on the previous
 
04:42:27.410 --> 04:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
administration they had lost so many
 
04:42:27.420 --> 04:42:30.830 align:start position:0%
administration they had lost so many
people

04:42:30.830 --> 04:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:32.690 --> 04:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
the states have done some very
 
04:42:34.670 --> 04:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
Innovative things now over the over the
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
10 years they've done some very
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
Innovative things and I would have to
 
04:42:37.440 --> 04:42:38.750 align:start position:0%
Innovative things and I would have to
say

04:42:38.750 --> 04:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:42:42.830 --> 04:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
Kentucky's attitude and that's uh I
 
04:42:44.208 --> 04:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
think pervasive among all of them
 
04:42:46.430 --> 04:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
Kentucky's attitude is that Health Care
 
04:42:49.490 --> 04:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
is a right not a privilege the States
 
04:42:51.530 --> 04:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
owe it to these constituents to have
 
04:42:53.810 --> 04:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
good health good quality Health Care
 
04:42:56.030 --> 04:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
said it flat out but they've had a lot
 
04:42:57.770 --> 04:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
of political issues but they're in very
 
04:43:03.770 --> 04:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:06.288 --> 04:43:06.298 align:start position:0%
and now as a result of this there are
 
04:43:08.270 --> 04:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
software companies that can help you
 
04:43:10.368 --> 04:43:10.378 align:start position:0%
convert over to a healthcare to a
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
state-based health care there's no doubt
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
about it
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
but the reason why that's not a turnkey
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
operation is they don't know what you
 
04:43:19.550 --> 04:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
want to do they don't know what you want
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:26.208 --> 04:43:26.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a problem their their
 
04:43:29.448 --> 04:43:29.458 align:start position:0%
health care uh on uh what do you call it
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
uncovered health care is about six
 
04:43:33.288 --> 04:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
percent not great
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
not not the worst I mean 18 for Texas is
 
04:43:37.610 --> 04:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
the worst
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
with six percent not terrible but our
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
underinsured rate is pathetic it's 20
 
04:43:42.958 --> 04:43:44.930 align:start position:0%
underinsured rate is pathetic it's 20
percent

04:43:44.930 --> 04:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:43:48.230 --> 04:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
are underinsured people who have to go
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
into debt so badly that they'll probably
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
lose their jobs lose their houses to pay
 
04:43:56.390 --> 04:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
for the deductibles and the premiums
 
04:43:57.948 --> 04:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
that they have to pay
 
04:43:59.930 --> 04:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
we could probably do something in that
 
04:43:59.940 --> 04:44:01.430 align:start position:0%
we could probably do something in that
area

04:44:01.430 --> 04:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
but the point of this is nobody
 
04:44:06.830 --> 04:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
implements a state-based health care
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
because oh I think I'll Implement a
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
state-based health care
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
it's a means to an end it's like the
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
fourth step in the process the first
 
04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
step of the process is to decide
 
04:44:20.208 --> 04:44:20.218 align:start position:0%
if you have the will
 
04:44:24.288 --> 04:44:24.298 align:start position:0%
all the resources to improve health care
 
04:44:26.570 --> 04:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
and do you have a goal in mind without
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
that there's no point to doing it
 
04:44:29.690 --> 04:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
because you're not going to save any
 
04:44:29.700 --> 04:44:30.650 align:start position:0%
because you're not going to save any
money

04:44:30.650 --> 04:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:44:33.230 --> 04:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
if all you're using it for is to
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
transition the health care from a
 
04:44:37.490 --> 04:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
federal based Health Care to a
 
04:44:39.288 --> 04:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
state-based health care it's not worth
 
04:44:41.448 --> 04:44:41.458 align:start position:0%
the effort if that is all you want out
 
04:44:43.788 --> 04:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
of it but if you want to get better
 
04:44:46.010 --> 04:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
health care out there
 
04:44:48.410 --> 04:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
subsidize the plans or do things like
 
04:44:51.288 --> 04:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
what Washington State
 
04:44:54.890 --> 04:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
Washington State implemented in 2019 a
 
04:44:58.250 --> 04:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
public option it didn't work so well and
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
they're having a lot of problems but
 
04:45:01.368 --> 04:45:01.378 align:start position:0%
they're not giving up the other thing
 
04:45:04.448 --> 04:45:04.458 align:start position:0%
they implemented was health care for
 
04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
never going to get covered under the
 
04:45:09.708 --> 04:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
federal plan
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
they churned on these they've worked
 
04:45:14.930 --> 04:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
these kinds of Innovations this
 
04:45:17.030 --> 04:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
collaborative care I saw one state that
 
04:45:18.530 --> 04:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
they're pulling everything they've got
 
04:45:20.570 --> 04:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
into that because they believe that's
 
04:45:22.490 --> 04:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
going to get their drug problem down and
 
04:45:23.448 --> 04:45:23.458 align:start position:0%
they believe they're going to get better
 
04:45:27.948 --> 04:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:30.770 --> 04:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
this year for the first time Colorado is
 
04:45:33.708 --> 04:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
coming out with a public option plan and
 
04:45:35.570 --> 04:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
their public option they say is going to
 
04:45:36.770 --> 04:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
save both them and the federal
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
government 200 million dollars
 
04:45:43.310 --> 04:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
because they can offer it at 23 percent
 
04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
lower premiums and the state is an
 
04:45:47.448 --> 04:45:47.458 align:start position:0%
effective Insurance Company
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
Washington had a lot of problems with
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
insurance companies being against it
 
04:45:53.990 --> 04:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
whether Colorado succeeds or not that's
 
04:45:55.310 --> 04:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
going to be something that everybody's
 
04:45:56.690 --> 04:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at
 
04:45:58.490 --> 04:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
and there are some states watching that
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
to see if that's going to work but if
 
04:46:01.730 --> 04:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do something that's
 
04:46:03.770 --> 04:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
Innovative if we're not going to try to
 
04:46:06.050 --> 04:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
improve anything then we're the wrong
 
04:46:09.050 --> 04:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
committee we're not the it's like as I
 
04:46:11.208 --> 04:46:11.218 align:start position:0%
was using as an example if what you have
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
is a beautiful nail
 
04:46:14.690 --> 04:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
and you're going to ask that nail
 
04:46:17.390 --> 04:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
company to go design you a house I have
 
04:46:19.550 --> 04:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
a nail I must I must want a house that's
 
04:46:21.650 --> 04:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
crazy we're in the middle this this
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong with us this belongs to
 
04:46:27.530 --> 04:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
the governor or it belongs
 
04:46:29.930 --> 04:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
to the Health and Human Services
 
04:46:31.550 --> 04:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
do they want to improve the health care
 
04:46:34.128 --> 04:46:34.138 align:start position:0%
if they don't then we don't do this
 
04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
and that's not our decision we're not in
 
04:46:38.270 --> 04:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
that health care business
 
04:46:40.910 --> 04:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
to design the health care itself that's
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
not what we do
 
04:46:46.670 --> 04:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm afraid my suggestion would be not
 
04:46:48.530 --> 04:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
do this and send it to the right
 
04:46:50.030 --> 04:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee and ask the sponsors to
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
rewrite it
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
and aim it to find out do we want Better
 
04:46:56.690 --> 04:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
Health Care other than that we don't do
 
04:46:59.090 --> 04:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
this and that's my recommendation
 
04:47:01.250 --> 04:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong here
 
04:47:03.770 --> 04:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
so if there was a study committee the
 
04:47:06.110 --> 04:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
study committee should really be people
 
04:47:07.690 --> 04:47:07.700 align:start position:0%
who were
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
the goal is not about whether we want to
 
04:47:14.930 --> 04:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
convert it but the goal is what can what
 
04:47:17.150 --> 04:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
we New Hampshire should do to have
 
04:47:18.650 --> 04:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
better health care
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's where it belongs that's where it
 
04:47:22.250 --> 04:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
belongs and it needs and it needs the
 
04:47:24.890 --> 04:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
governor to want to have have the will
 
04:47:26.570 --> 04:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
to support that kind of an effort
 
04:47:28.970 --> 04:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
because it's not a cheap effort because
 
04:47:32.208 --> 04:47:32.218 align:start position:0%
states end up putting money in
 
04:47:35.090 --> 04:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
into it is that all the states end up
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
spending more money but the cost of the
 
04:47:40.250 --> 04:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
actual implementation of the base of the
 
04:47:42.170 --> 04:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange is the smallest
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
part of it right but the argument was of
 
04:47:46.730 --> 04:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
this bill is it's supposed to save us
 
04:47:51.530 --> 04:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
it won't
 
04:47:55.970 --> 04:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
because without the specifications
 
04:47:57.890 --> 04:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
you're going to get garbage garbage in
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
garbage out it might not Mr chairman
 
04:48:03.890 --> 04:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
because the question the point that
 
04:48:06.110 --> 04:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative spear is making is it
 
04:48:08.090 --> 04:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
will be dependent upon what kind of
 
04:48:10.910 --> 04:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
Health Care exactly we want to provide
 
04:48:13.610 --> 04:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
for people in New Hampshire right if we
 
04:48:16.070 --> 04:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
design our own system it could be more
 
04:48:18.770 --> 04:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
expensive it could be less expensive
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately what comes into play here is
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional issue
 
04:48:25.850 --> 04:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
the federal government effectively
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
took this issue on and said this is a
 
04:48:31.850 --> 04:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
national issue and we're going to oppose
 
04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
the ACA upon all 50 states because we
 
04:48:36.170 --> 04:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
can't tell the 50 states that they just
 
04:48:38.570 --> 04:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
have to do this that's that that's
 
04:48:40.970 --> 04:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional but they provided for
 
04:48:43.010 --> 04:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
the states to be able to have their own
 
04:48:45.288 --> 04:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
systems all right so it was kind of a
 
04:48:48.050 --> 04:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
backdoor way to get states to to into
 
04:48:50.090 --> 04:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
the program so either do it our way or
 
04:48:52.970 --> 04:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
you can do it your way right and so
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
what's happening and through the
 
04:48:56.270 --> 04:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
narrative that's been provided
 
04:48:58.490 --> 04:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
To Us by representative Speer is that
 
04:49:00.110 --> 04:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
there are a number of states that in
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
fact have decided to do that and some of
 
04:49:04.550 --> 04:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
them have done it better than others for
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
a variety of reasons that she has
 
04:49:09.410 --> 04:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
outlined so yes ultimately the question
 
04:49:11.930 --> 04:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
here is whether there is the political
 
04:49:11.940 --> 04:49:13.190 align:start position:0%
here is whether there is the political
will

04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:49:16.490 --> 04:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
desire and will in New Hampshire to
 
04:49:19.310 --> 04:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
design its own system which may or may
 
04:49:24.410 --> 04:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
not cost more than the federal mandate
 
04:49:26.570 --> 04:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's the question and is that really
 
04:49:28.550 --> 04:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
is that really what we're asking this
 
04:49:30.650 --> 04:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
study committee to do it's because she's
 
04:49:33.770 --> 04:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
she's right this isn't just about money
 
04:49:35.990 --> 04:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is about health care
 
04:49:39.110 --> 04:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
and what we want to do as a state
 
04:49:41.390 --> 04:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
so does this is that what's happening
 
04:49:43.190 --> 04:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
being envisioned here through the study
 
04:49:46.128 --> 04:49:46.138 align:start position:0%
committee it sounds to me representative
 
04:49:47.930 --> 04:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
sphere in your analysis that that's not
 
04:49:51.170 --> 04:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
clear to you it's not clear that this is
 
04:49:53.690 --> 04:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
this this this study committee through
 
04:49:53.700 --> 04:49:54.770 align:start position:0%
this this this study committee through
this

04:49:54.770 --> 04:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:49:54.780 --> 04:49:56.448 align:start position:0%
this
body

04:49:56.448 --> 04:49:56.458 align:start position:0%
body
 
04:50:02.690 --> 04:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:04.910 --> 04:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
you only Implement based on history
 
04:50:08.330 --> 04:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
based on the 18 States including Idaho
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
if you have a goal in mind this is the
 
04:50:15.050 --> 04:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
state-based state-based exchange is a
 
04:50:17.628 --> 04:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
means to an end it is one step in the
 
04:50:17.638 --> 04:50:19.128 align:start position:0%
means to an end it is one step in the
process

04:50:19.128 --> 04:50:19.138 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:50:21.830 --> 04:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
what's the goal you need to have a goal
 
04:50:23.390 --> 04:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have a goal then you
 
04:50:25.610 --> 04:50:25.620 align:start position:0%
don't move and there should be 50 goals
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
from 50 states and they're not going to
 
04:50:29.330 --> 04:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
be the same because not every state
 
04:50:31.490 --> 04:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
population is the same nor is its
 
04:50:33.770 --> 04:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
political will the same
 
04:50:35.930 --> 04:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
as to what it wants to do for its
 
04:50:38.208 --> 04:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
population and please understand I
 
04:50:39.708 --> 04:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
believe that we need better health care
 
04:50:42.590 --> 04:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not stopping that what I'm saying is
 
04:50:45.410 --> 04:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
we're not Commerce is not where you do
 
04:50:49.010 --> 04:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
that so in terms of the duties in the
 
04:50:52.310 --> 04:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:55.070 --> 04:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh are you saying these are
 
04:50:58.368 --> 04:50:58.378 align:start position:0%
these not good goals or these are I
 
04:51:00.650 --> 04:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
think that the goals are okay as far as
 
04:51:02.330 --> 04:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
they go but if they come through the
 
04:51:05.090 --> 04:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee the seriousness of it
 
04:51:05.100 --> 04:51:07.368 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee the seriousness of it
and

04:51:07.368 --> 04:51:07.378 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:09.890 --> 04:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
the seriousness of it and the care that
 
04:51:11.810 --> 04:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
will go into coming up with a solution
 
04:51:14.208 --> 04:51:14.218 align:start position:0%
is not going to be there
 
04:51:17.390 --> 04:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
it needs in all honesty if it wasn't
 
04:51:19.550 --> 04:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
something said by the governor I don't
 
04:51:22.150 --> 04:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
see why we would move ahead
 
04:51:24.590 --> 04:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
I believe what representative spear is
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
telling at least about what I'm hearing
 
04:51:27.890 --> 04:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
from her is that if you want to get your
 
04:51:30.170 --> 04:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
cart if you want to get your if you have
 
04:51:31.730 --> 04:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
a medical problem you don't go to an
 
04:51:33.230 --> 04:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
auto repair shop
 
04:51:35.208 --> 04:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
right so this is not she's saying this
 
04:51:38.208 --> 04:51:38.218 align:start position:0%
is not the right committee this is not
 
04:51:39.830 --> 04:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
where we ought to be doing this well
 
04:51:42.670 --> 04:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
this order there's a better place
 
04:51:46.070 --> 04:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
this is not necessarily this committee I
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
mean we could it you know it has right
 
04:51:49.368 --> 04:51:49.378 align:start position:0%
now one member in the Senate and three
 
04:51:51.650 --> 04:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
members of the house we could absolutely
 
04:51:53.208 --> 04:51:53.218 align:start position:0%
say that those three members of the
 
04:51:55.070 --> 04:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
house should be Health and Human
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
Services but if the governor isn't on
 
04:51:57.240 --> 04:51:58.070 align:start position:0%
Services but if the governor isn't on
board

04:51:58.070 --> 04:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
if it didn't come from the highest every
 
04:52:01.730 --> 04:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
single state
 
04:52:05.230 --> 04:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:08.090 --> 04:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
every single state that did it came from
 
04:52:10.010 --> 04:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
the will of the governor to improve it
 
04:52:13.250 --> 04:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
as the Governor from Kentucky said
 
04:52:16.430 --> 04:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
Health Care is a man is a right if they
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
don't have that will at the top
 
04:52:21.650 --> 04:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
if they don't have the information that
 
04:52:26.170 --> 04:52:26.180 align:start position:0%
says what has to be done then it's not
 
04:52:28.250 --> 04:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
unless you want to take it on as an
 
04:52:29.930 --> 04:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
academic exercise in which case I've
 
04:52:31.810 --> 04:52:31.820 align:start position:0%
done some of the work and I can help you
 
04:52:35.170 --> 04:52:35.180 align:start position:0%
not me
 
04:52:37.970 --> 04:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
okay representative Burroughs yeah yeah
 
04:52:40.430 --> 04:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
I mean even if you get three senators
 
04:52:42.530 --> 04:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
and three
 
04:52:44.510 --> 04:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives they're still not going
 
04:52:46.250 --> 04:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
to have the expertise that's needed to
 
04:52:47.570 --> 04:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
do it they're not the appropriate people
 
04:52:49.310 --> 04:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
to do it so I don't think it matters
 
04:52:51.948 --> 04:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
which committee it is it's I just think
 
04:52:55.368 --> 04:52:55.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:57.230 --> 04:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean we're smart but we're not
 
04:52:59.030 --> 04:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
that smart so what is your
 
04:53:02.090 --> 04:53:02.100 align:start position:0%
recommendation my recommendation
 
04:53:04.010 --> 04:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
I hate to kill it
 
04:53:06.050 --> 04:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
because I believe we need good health
 
04:53:07.670 --> 04:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
care and I don't think our health care
 
04:53:09.850 --> 04:53:09.860 align:start position:0%
is good this is not going to be the way
 
04:53:12.350 --> 04:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
shall we retain it so that we can find
 
04:53:14.410 --> 04:53:14.420 align:start position:0%
the right
 
04:53:17.330 --> 04:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
incentives or should we just kill it
 
04:53:19.730 --> 04:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
no don't just kill it I mean retain it
 
04:53:21.170 --> 04:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can
 
04:53:22.730 --> 04:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
talk to some people
 
04:53:24.830 --> 04:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
you can find out where it should go and
 
04:53:28.490 --> 04:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
I will put you in charge of subcommittee
 
04:53:29.930 --> 04:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
to to
 
04:53:32.330 --> 04:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
gather those people and help rewrite
 
04:53:35.570 --> 04:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
this language to to inspire wait a
 
04:53:37.850 --> 04:53:37.860 align:start position:0%
minute no I'm not saying that no no no
 
04:53:39.770 --> 04:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
hold on I'll be glad to talk to the
 
04:53:41.510 --> 04:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
people to anybody you think would might
 
04:53:43.490 --> 04:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
be good right
 
04:53:45.288 --> 04:53:45.298 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that we're going to
 
04:53:47.270 --> 04:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
come out with another set of legislation
 
04:53:49.128 --> 04:53:49.138 align:start position:0%
because you can't legislate from the
 
04:53:51.530 --> 04:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
bottom so Mr chairman what I'm hearing
 
04:53:53.150 --> 04:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
is if we're going to retain this at the
 
04:53:55.610 --> 04:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
same time representative spear is is
 
04:53:58.490 --> 04:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
making the case for executive leadership
 
04:54:00.410 --> 04:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
right that is from from the governor
 
04:54:02.750 --> 04:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
because what has to happen here is that
 
04:54:05.330 --> 04:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
there has to be huge amounts of public
 
04:54:08.330 --> 04:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
engagement to determine what the will of
 
04:54:12.948 --> 04:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
the people are or is for health care for
 
04:54:14.990 --> 04:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
its citizens we're not going to do that
 
04:54:17.330 --> 04:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
through a study committee and we're not
 
04:54:18.770 --> 04:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
going to do that through this committee
 
04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
and and the role of the in our form of
 
04:54:23.330 --> 04:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
government the role of the legislature
 
04:54:25.850 --> 04:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm a legislator but the role of the
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
legislator is not the role of the
 
04:54:31.010 --> 04:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
executive the role of the executive is
 
04:54:33.230 --> 04:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
the one that's where the leadership has
 
04:54:35.868 --> 04:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
to come from with the assistance of the
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
legislative branch in order to get
 
04:54:41.150 --> 04:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
something as gargantuan as this to be
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
accomplished i i as somebody who's not a
 
04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
huge fan of the ACA let me let me just
 
04:54:49.610 --> 04:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
refer everybody back nevertheless to the
 
04:54:51.970 --> 04:54:51.980 align:start position:0%
fact this did not come from the Congress
 
04:54:54.410 --> 04:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
this initiative did not come from the
 
04:54:57.170 --> 04:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
Congress this this came from the
 
04:54:58.850 --> 04:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
executive branch of government and from
 
04:55:00.770 --> 04:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
the president of the United States and
 
04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
those that worked within the executive
 
04:55:04.730 --> 04:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
branch collaboratively with the
 
04:55:06.470 --> 04:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
legislative branch the Congress in order
 
04:55:08.510 --> 04:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
to get this accomplished I can't imagine
 
04:55:11.090 --> 04:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
that there would be an ACA today if
 
04:55:14.330 --> 04:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
President Obama had opposed it to put it
 
04:55:16.550 --> 04:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
negatively so that everybody gets the
 
04:55:16.560 --> 04:55:17.570 align:start position:0%
negatively so that everybody gets the
point

04:55:17.570 --> 04:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:55:19.368 --> 04:55:19.378 align:start position:0%
we need Executive leadership now I don't
 
04:55:23.470 --> 04:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:26.990 --> 04:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
so a comment represented back later you
 
04:55:29.690 --> 04:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
know if you if you look at ACA where did
 
04:55:32.270 --> 04:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
that come from it came from Romney care
 
04:55:34.610 --> 04:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts yes that's where it
 
04:55:37.128 --> 04:55:37.138 align:start position:0%
came from and so you had a governor that
 
04:55:39.770 --> 04:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
was on board from the beginning and you
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
know we don't know if we did all of this
 
04:55:45.948 --> 04:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
work and if Governor tsunu would veto it
 
04:55:49.250 --> 04:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
so I don't know who would talk to the
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
governor about this but obviously it
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
would make sense to see make sure that
 
04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
that he's on board the executive
 
04:55:59.030 --> 04:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee is on board uh before anybody
 
04:56:02.208 --> 04:56:02.218 align:start position:0%
proceeds on this I will say this in
 
04:56:03.590 --> 04:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
04:56:05.750 --> 04:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
what the states did to come up with a
 
04:56:07.190 --> 04:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
successful plan
 
04:56:10.730 --> 04:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
the research that went into
 
04:56:13.850 --> 04:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
figuring out what was required what they
 
04:56:16.128 --> 04:56:16.138 align:start position:0%
wanted to what they what the data was
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
even that's problematic for the state
 
04:56:22.730 --> 04:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:26.330 --> 04:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
that in order to even satisfy this study
 
04:56:28.250 --> 04:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
committee to come up with what is
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
required and to come up with what are
 
04:56:32.990 --> 04:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
our possible solutions could be
 
04:56:34.730 --> 04:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
expensive enough that at the committee
 
04:56:37.788 --> 04:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
level we could never do it
 
04:56:39.770 --> 04:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact on those four states
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
those four states that were immediately
 
04:56:43.610 --> 04:56:43.620 align:start position:0%
successful they were subsidized by the
 
04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
feds they didn't do that by themselves
 
04:56:50.270 --> 04:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
one of the states said it cost them 85
 
04:56:53.090 --> 04:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
million dollars to straighten out their
 
04:56:55.788 --> 04:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
implementation just to get it to work 85
 
04:56:57.890 --> 04:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
million dollars so before we start
 
04:56:59.628 --> 04:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
talking about whether or not we're going
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
to start with a state-based we better
 
04:57:04.250 --> 04:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
find out what
 
04:57:06.470 --> 04:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
if there's any will
 
04:57:08.810 --> 04:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
and therefore the resources because it's
 
04:57:11.570 --> 04:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
not going to be cheap represent Phillip
 
04:57:14.150 --> 04:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
with respect my colleagues before Romney
 
04:57:15.890 --> 04:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
care was Romney care or Obamacare was
 
04:57:18.350 --> 04:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
Obamacare it came from the bottom it
 
04:57:20.990 --> 04:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
came from people wishing for these types
 
04:57:22.970 --> 04:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
of programs to happen
 
04:57:26.150 --> 04:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that if we we all know that
 
04:57:28.610 --> 04:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
when our constituents want something to
 
04:57:31.250 --> 04:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
happen our email boxes will tell us that
 
04:57:33.590 --> 04:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
they want that to happen and the number
 
04:57:35.090 --> 04:57:35.100 align:start position:0%
of emails that I've received on this
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
bill are zero which tells us that
 
04:57:41.330 --> 04:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
there's not much of a public outcry for
 
04:57:44.030 --> 04:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
a state-based Insurance Exchange
 
04:57:47.448 --> 04:57:47.458 align:start position:0%
which makes this a bill in search of a
 
04:57:50.030 --> 04:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
problem to would this bill be to reduce
 
04:57:53.090 --> 04:57:53.100 align:start position:0%
insurance rates maybe would this be to
 
04:57:55.970 --> 04:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
make a more user-friendly website maybe
 
04:57:57.890 --> 04:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
would this to be expand insurance
 
04:58:01.128 --> 04:58:01.138 align:start position:0%
coverage maybe but we don't know because
 
04:58:03.288 --> 04:58:03.298 align:start position:0%
there's no public desire for this which
 
04:58:05.628 --> 04:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
makes us the perfect Bill to see the
 
04:58:07.930 --> 04:58:07.940 align:start position:0%
trash can
 
04:58:11.208 --> 04:58:11.218 align:start position:0%
I wasn't going to say that
 
04:58:11.218 --> 04:58:14.448 align:start position:0%
I wasn't going to say that
ouch

04:58:14.448 --> 04:58:14.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:17.208 --> 04:58:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:19.930 --> 04:58:19.940 align:start position:0%
okay I'll make that motion
 
04:58:25.570 --> 04:58:25.580 align:start position:0%
no okay Reverend collabro oh my God

we all want better health care for
