00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
last year we passed this
 
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
out of the house went to the senate
 
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.790 align:start position:0%
out of the house went to the senate
and

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
and there was a oops
 
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall
 
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.110 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall
and

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment attached to it
 
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
and uh sadly the governor vetoed this
 
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.750 align:start position:0%
and uh sadly the governor vetoed this
bill

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
has said and the other side said as long
 
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
as there's no attachments they will pass
 
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 align:start position:0%
this so i hope we can
 
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.869 align:start position:0%
 
currently

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
if you have a concealed new hampshire
 
00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 align:start position:0%
concealed carry license
 
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
you can carry a gun
 
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
on a snowmobile or a four-wheeler
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
now you're going to hear testimony i'm
 
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
assuming if they show up
 
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.830 align:start position:0%
assuming if they show up
that

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a
 
00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
accidental discharges
 
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
if this passes
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
well i'll tell you right now most people
 
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
that i know
 
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
that ride snowmobiles and four-wheelers
 
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
carry a gun and i've never heard of an
 
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
accidental discharge
 
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
because most people don't know that
 
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
there's a tiny little law in fishing
 
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
game that goes against constitutional
 
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.350 align:start position:0%
game that goes against constitutional
carry

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
that says you can't carry while you're
 
00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
on a snowmobile
 
00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.830 align:start position:0%
on a snowmobile
or

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm also told that fish and game will
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
not enforce this
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
because they were told by the a.g that
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
if you enforce this if you you know
 
00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
give somebody a ticket for carrying a
 
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
gun on a snowmobile or a four-wheeler
 
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to be thrown out of court
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
and so they've been told not to enforce
 
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
this so this is really just a
 
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill it's just to clean the
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
language out so that way constitutional
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
carry in new hampshire
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
is constitutional carry in new hampshire
 
00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 align:start position:0%
you should have a right
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
any vehicle you're in to carry a gun
 
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
without a license
 
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
and again if you have a concealed carry
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
license today like i do
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
and i was just on a snowmobile
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's the way it is but if you don't
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
have a concealed carry license because
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
you don't need one for constitutional
 
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.110 align:start position:0%
you don't need one for constitutional
carry

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
carry
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
then fish and game can
 
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
cite you against this law that is on the
 
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
books which i'm hoping to repeal
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
and again fish and game was told not to
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
do that but we still need to clean the
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
language up so that way everything is
 
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.790 align:start position:0%
language up so that way everything is
clean

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
clean
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to our laws
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for your allowing me
 
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
to speak and i hope you vote yes on this
 
00:05:51.039 --> 00:06:05.110 align:start position:0%
to speak and i hope you vote yes on this
bill

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i'm here on behalf of gun
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
owners of america
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
we strongly support representative
 
00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
burt's bill we were a strong supporter
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
of constitutional carry
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
when it was enacted in 2017 we've now
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
had almost five years
 
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.110 align:start position:0%
had almost five years
of

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
residents and visitors to new hampshire
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%

their person
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
in their cars in their pickup trucks and
 
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
on their boats without a license um the
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
outlier is as representative burt stated
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
an antiquated fish and game law that
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
requires a person
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
to obtain a license to carry a concealed
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
and loaded pistol or revolver
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
or even an openly
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
carried pistol or revolver on a snow
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
machine or an atv
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
it's inconsistent with our
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
constitutional carry law
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
it violates article 2a as representative
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
electronic testimony for the committee
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
um but i do just want to echo we see
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
this as a common sense cleanup measure
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
just to make permit less carry
 
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
consistent across the board and
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
certainly you shouldn't give up your
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
right to self-defense just because you
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
chose to recreate on an off-train
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle versus some other sort of
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle so i'm happy to take any
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
questions but like i said i will submit
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
electronic testimony to the committee as
 
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.990 align:start position:0%
electronic testimony to the committee as

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
there be no questions thank you for your
 
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.949 align:start position:0%
there be no questions thank you for your
testimony

00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
and cold so i apologize if i
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
not copeland just fighting
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
i'm an attorney i'm licensed in maine
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire massachusetts and i'm
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
admitted to several federal courts as
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
well and i'm just
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
calling it or testifying here to say
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
that this is really common sense
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
that depict on a person because of their
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
choice of transportation and
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
particularly women
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
i think of women i've had several
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
surgeries i still need a new ankle yet
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i need to be able to defend myself
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
in any situation and by any mode of
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
transportation but as the committee
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
consider that in the fact that
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
you can't always choose your method of
 
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.509 align:start position:0%
you can't always choose your method of
transportation

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
and you certainly can't choose where the
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
bad guys are and so being a woman and
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
being unfortunately i never thought it'd
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
be but somewhat disabled in
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
transportation somewhat i need to be
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
able to defend myself and i'd last the
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
committee to give us that opportunity
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%

enforce it or they won't because they
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%

hearing on house bill 1668 requiring a
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
background check prior to any commercial
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%

just find myself recently in a position
 
00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:35.589 align:start position:0%
just find myself recently in a position
of

00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
being follicly challenged and it's very
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
cold so
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
i apologize and there's no disrespect
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
meant by that
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
um thank you members of the committee
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
my name is catherine rogers i represent
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
merrimack district 28 which is the east
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
side of concord
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
and we happily welcome you to our city
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
every day
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 1668 is a simple bill
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
it fills a loophole that currently
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
exists by requiring commercial
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
advertised firearm sales or transfers to
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
be subject to a criminal background
 
00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.710 align:start position:0%
be subject to a criminal background
check

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
if that does not happen the seller faces
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor penalty for each violation
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
the language is clear and specific
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
it makes an exception for sales or
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
transfers between friends and families
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
this is not an overreach by government
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
it's a public safety measure to keep
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
more guns out of the hands of those who
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
we all agree shouldn't have them people
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
like felons and domestic abusers
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
we may be lucky enough to have avoided
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
the spotlight of any national tragedy
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
with any mass shooting so far in our
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
state however we're not immune to
 
00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.510 align:start position:0%
state however we're not immune to
violence

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
violence
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
we do have firearms-related violence in
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is also a net exporter of
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
guns and the substantial percentage of
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
our firearms have a short time to crime
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
that is the percentage of guns recovered
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
in a crime within two years of original
 
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.109 align:start position:0%
in a crime within two years of original
sale

00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
sale
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
a strong indicator of gun trafficking
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
according to data collected from the gun
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
trafficking statistics from the bureau
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
of alcohol tobacco firearms and
 
00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.589 align:start position:0%
of alcohol tobacco firearms and
explosives

00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
explosives
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire exported 18.3 guns per
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand inhabitants whereas the
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
national average was 14.1 and 29.3
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
percent of new hampshire's firearms have
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
a short time to crime the national
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
average was 22.6
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
you will likely hear the argument that
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
this bill will only affect law-abiding
 
00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.750 align:start position:0%
this bill will only affect law-abiding
citizens

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
because criminals don't follow the law
 
00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.950 align:start position:0%
because criminals don't follow the law
anyway

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
my response is that why don't we all
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
just pack up and go home
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a good thing for some of us
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
to think
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
what's good in passing laws when
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
criminals don't follow any of the laws
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
laws impose restrictions on the behavior
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
of only those who follow them
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
laws therefore only hurt law-abiding
 
00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.230 align:start position:0%
laws therefore only hurt law-abiding
citizens

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
every law could be refuted with this
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
paradox and societies would swiftly
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
descend into anarchy laws against rape
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
murder and theft for example are rarely
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
followed by rapists murderers and
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
thieves but the fact that such people
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
exist in society is the reason these
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
you may hear also that the second
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is sacred and should never be
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
regulated under any circumstance we know
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
that the supreme court has ruled that it
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
can be regulated and we know that that
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
same constitution
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
also grants the right to free speech and
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
yet we do not have the right to yell
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
fire in a crowded theater
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
and while we're talking about the
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
constitution we also have a constitution
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
that provides for a free and fair
 
00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:46.150 align:start position:0%
that provides for a free and fair
election

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
but we do ask people to identify
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
themselves when they go to the polls
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
more and more so we ask for more
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
identity so that's regulated everything
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
in the constitution can be regulated
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
reasonably house bill 1668's a simple
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
bill but it merely requires anyone
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
selling a firearm at an in-state gun
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
show flea market or via online
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
solicitation or classified ad to get a
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
background check
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's constitutional and it's a
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
regulation that fits in with the beliefs
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
and the majority of our population
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
close to 80 percent of the population
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
supports this kind of regulation
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
i ask you to look at this bill
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully and vote ought to pass and
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes i had a question for representative
 
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.990 align:start position:0%
yes i had a question for representative
rogers

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
you're recognized
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative rogers is this bill uh
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the same as hb
 
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.549 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the same as hb
1379

00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
1379
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
from the 2000 from the 2020 session
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
yes it is representative muse
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is cindy white i'm an
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
attorney from hopkinton and i'm here in
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
david ray connolly was barred from
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
owning a firearm because of his criminal
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
record but he bought a gun over the
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
internet with no background check and he
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
used it to massacre eight people in
 
00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.790 align:start position:0%
used it to massacre eight people in
texas

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
texas
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
dylann roof was prohibited by law from
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
buying a gun but was allowed to buy one
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
because the background check was not
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
completed within three business days he
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
used that gun to massacre nine people at
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
a charleston church during bible study
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
these cases happened in other states but
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
they could just as easily have happened
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
here because of gaping loopholes in our
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
gun safety laws
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
keeping guns out of the hands of
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
dangerous persons is critical we know
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
that it's risky to allow felons domestic
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
views abusers and other prohibited
 
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.470 align:start position:0%
views abusers and other prohibited
persons

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
persons
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
to have access to guns
 
00:52:22.349 --> 00:52:22.359 align:start position:0%
in 34 of mass shootings between 2009
 
00:52:22.359 --> 00:52:23.990 align:start position:0%
in 34 of mass shootings between 2009
2016

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
2016
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
the gunman was legally barred from
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
possessing firearms
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
studies show that stronger background
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
check laws are associated with
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
significantly lower rates of firearms
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
homicides and suicides
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
many people misunderstand the current
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
law and believe that the federal law
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
requires background checks in all cases
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
but it does not
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
the federal brady law has been very
 
00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.349 align:start position:0%
the federal brady law has been very
successful

00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
it has blocked sales to millions of
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
dangerous people who are not legally
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
allowed to possess guns
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
but but it applies only to sales by
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
federally licensed firearms dealers
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
because of that limitation an estimated
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
22 percent of all gun sales
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
millions each year take place with no
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
background check many at gun chosen over
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
the internet
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
hb 1668 would help close this loophole
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
enacting a state background check
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
requirement should be an easy choice
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
it's a win-win situation
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
it will enhance public safety and save
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
lives while respecting the rights of
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable law-abiding gun owners
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
nobody should want to allow guns to get
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
into the hands of dangerous people and
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
almost nobody does
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
background check requirements are
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
supported by 97 percent of americans
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
and 94 percent of granite state staters
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
including 90 percent of gun owners
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
the bill would also close a second
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
gaping hole in the federal law the
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
charleston loophole by requiring
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
completion of the background check
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
before a commercial firearm sale
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
federal law does not require this
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
under the law a licensed firearm dealer
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
may proceed with the sale of a firearm
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
after three business days even if the
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
required background check has not been
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
completed and there's been no
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
confirmation that the buyer is legally
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
permitted to buy a gun
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
as a result people who are prohibited
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
from law by purchasing a gun are often
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
allowed to buy one just because the
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
background check has not been finished
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
the best known example of this is dylann
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
roof but there are many cases like this
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
that happen every day
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
requiring a completed background check
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
would not delay most gun sales most
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
background checks are finished very
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
quickly in only about 11 percent of
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
cases does the nics need more
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
information and it is important that
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
they be allowed to get that information
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
time to get it
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
of the cases in 2017 in which nics
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
delayed its answer to get more
 
00:54:44.559 --> 00:54:46.950 align:start position:0%
delayed its answer to get more
information

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
it later determined that more than six
 
00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.230 align:start position:0%
it later determined that more than six
thousand

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
of those people were legally prohibited
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
from buying a firearm
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in almost 5000 of those
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
cases the seller allowed the prohibited
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
person to buy a weapon because the
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
background check was not completed
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
within three business days
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
this committee is charged with

protecting public safety
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
it should not allow partisan divides and
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
heated rhetoric against gun laws to
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
interfere with its duty to somberly
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
assess this bill
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
hb 1668 does not prevent anyone who is
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
legally permitted to have a gun from
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
getting one
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
but it does strengthen the law to help
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
assure that dangerous persons who are
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
not legally allowed to have guns do not
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
get one
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
for those reasons i ask you to vote for
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%

you've already as you're well aware
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
it has changed slightly since previous
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
generations of the bill it does seem to
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
allow more exceptions than the last
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
version i recall
 
00:56:19.839 --> 00:56:20.390 align:start position:0%

you know the background check system is
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
not 100 either we've heard of mistakes
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
we've heard some people say that there
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
were people who had not been reported to
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
the next system because of errors by
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
either the police department the air
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
force was one example where someone
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
was a danger who was not reported by the
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
air force and was able to commit a crime
 
00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.390 align:start position:0%
air force and was able to commit a crime
with

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
getting those firearms the three-day
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
waiting period is something that
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
if you heard testimony that it
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
if you don't get uh
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
an answer back in three days you're
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
automatically allowed to get your
 
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.270 align:start position:0%
automatically allowed to get your
firearm

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know it is long enough to do the job
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
most almost every mistake that i've
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
heard of and and you will hear of that
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
the person got a firearm after three
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
days without being denied after three
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
days was due to an error now do we give
 
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
someone 10 days to not make us an hour a
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
week two months
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's going to make a
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
difference these have all been examples
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
that really have not would not have been
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
prevented by this law whatsoever
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
if you look at people buying firearms on
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
the internet without doing a background
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
check from a dealer that is already
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
against the law firearm sealers are not
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%

in-state other licensed dealer
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's already illegal so all these
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
examples you've heard were either errors
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
by people in the system that we're
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
make stronger
 
00:57:51.119 --> 00:57:52.390 align:start position:0%
make stronger
or

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
were illegal acts so i please ask you to
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
i tell this bill and i'd be happy to
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%

has found
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
that about 90 percent of individuals who
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
die by suicide are experiencing a mental

and people under the age of 24 or above

suicide
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
we have endured and are still dealing
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
with a worldwide pandemic
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
that has been a national trauma
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
the weights in our community hospitals
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
for mental health services are weeks at
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
a time
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
and should show us in no uncertain terms
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
that the current overall mental health
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
of our state is not okay
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
requiring background checks to acquire
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
the most deadly means to harm oneself
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
or others is the absolute
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
least we can do
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
this is a suicide prevention bill in my
 
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.589 align:start position:0%
this is a suicide prevention bill in my
opinion

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i urge the committee to vote ought
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
thank you the witness is excused
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you

chair members

i can't get this down i'm just going to
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
go like this
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to say a quick with
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
mental health and the sale of firearms i
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
am opposed to this bill
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to it passing uh for the for the
 
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:18.789 align:start position:0%
opposed to it passing uh for the for the
mere

01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
mere
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
fact of um
 
01:03:21.039 --> 01:03:21.910 align:start position:0%
fact of um
i

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
have the right to carry i have concealed
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
carry so
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
um but i had to wait three days for my
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
for because i
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't know why it
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
ended up taking three days for my pass
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
the fir the second time the first time i
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
got it in three hours the second time it
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
took three days so there is a problem
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
what i what i want to point out is that
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
um a federal background check
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think is as good as what our
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
dealers are doing individually my when i
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
went to sig and um
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
they actually
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
interviewed me
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
they sat down with me i still i did the
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
federal background check too
 
01:04:09.119 --> 01:04:10.309 align:start position:0%
federal background check too
um

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
because of the weapon that i wanted to
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
purchase however
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
i think they did a better job than what
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
the federal government did because the
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason didn't allow me to
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
have my federal license and or have it
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
approved for three days where they were
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
able to do it the first time
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
with regards to mental health the bottom
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
line is is that we're worried about
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
suicide being the number one cause and
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
because of a mental health crisis then
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
let's take the money that it would cost
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
to keep to put this in place and put it
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
towards our mental health and our
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you you are excused
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
my name is alan rice and i am a resident
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
of bedford new hampshire and i'm here on
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
behalf of gun owners of america
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
we are on record as being opposed to
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1668
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
major intrusion into private activities
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
between private parties
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
this isn't about commercial sales this
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
is about
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
someone selling lending
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
gifting a gun to a friend family member
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
or neighbor
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
and forcing all those sales through
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
licensed firearms dealers
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
over the last few years and this
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
committee passed last year legislation
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
to address that
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
we've seen a lot of delays with the
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
check system
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
forcing tens of thousands more sales
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
through that check system
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
would certainly
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
make the problem worse
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
there is no loophole
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
um federal law actually covers some of
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
the things that the supporters of this
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill are concerned about
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
we're not exporting guns because that's
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
against the law
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
to sell a gun privately the two parties
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
to the transaction need to be a resident
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
of the same state so there's no way
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
someone from massachusetts or maine or
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
any other state
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
can answer a classified ad and come to
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and buy a gun
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's against federal law and there's
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement that
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
aggressively prosecute those violations
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
there's no loophole
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is a major
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a non-existent
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
problem and we would urge this committee
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
house bill 1668 in expedient to
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
legislate and i'd be happy to entertain
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%

my attorney pointed me out to section

one commercial sale means a transfer of
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
ownership including
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
before you ask the question let me just
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
remind the members of the committee that
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
we are not permitted to debate
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
any witness who testifies before the
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
committee we ask questions in order to
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%

01:07:59.829 --> 01:07:59.839 align:start position:0%
of that concern and then did amend this
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill so it would loosely define that
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
language and that in fact that you still
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
could be gifted a gun by your family
 
01:08:06.319 --> 01:08:07.510 align:start position:0%
could be gifted a gun by your family
member

01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
member
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative what i'm aware of is i
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
spent quite a few hours with our inside
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
council being briefed on this bill and
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
he tells me this is a gross overreach
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's an anti-gun bill designed to chill
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
private activities between friends
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
family members and neighbors he tells me
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
that this bill will not solve any of the
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
problems that you claim to need to
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
that need to be solved but it will put
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise law-abiding people at risk of
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the witness
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
is excused
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman the committee now
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
calls lauren lepage national liberal
 
01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:52.709 align:start position:0%
calls lauren lepage national liberal
association

01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is lauren lepage
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a resident of stanford maine and i'm
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
the state director for the national
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
rifle association here in new hampshire
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
i will be brief and will um
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
like as in my previous testimonies
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
submit something in writing to the
 
01:09:06.719 --> 01:09:07.829 align:start position:0%
submit something in writing to the
committee

01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that we are in
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
opposition to this legislation
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
this legislation does
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
call for background checks on the
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
commercial sale of firearms but it is
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
duplicative federal law already requires
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
you if you are engaged in the business
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
of selling firearms or trying to make a
 
01:09:26.719 --> 01:09:28.070 align:start position:0%
of selling firearms or trying to make a
livelihood

01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
livelihood
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
that you require a federal license and
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of where any sort of transfer
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
takes place as a licensee an ffl you are
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
required to do an in-person background
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
check under federal law which is um
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
like i said duplicative and unnecessary
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
so for that main reason
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
my written testimony will be a little
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
more detailed
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're in opposition to the bill and i'm
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
name is penny dean
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
from concord new hampshire and i would
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
ask that the bill be itled
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
and the first thing i would suggest we
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
hear the term loophole again and again
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's online dictionaries there's
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
webster's dictionaries the term loophole
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
is a very well defined term
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
and it means a failure to avoid the
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
scope of a law
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
18 usc did not intend to capture all of
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
these things that people complain about
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
there is no loophole in the law the law
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
works perfectly as it was designed to do
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
so when they talk about a loophole there
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
isn't any
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
secondly the things that most the people
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
are complaining about
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
some of them are already illegal and
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
they can still be prosecuted but what we
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
see happening more and more even with
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
the current check system is that people
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
who are lawfully able to
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
and should be able to have guns are
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
denied because of glitches in the system
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
not the opposite not to say the opposite
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
but when one person said for fifteen
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars i could have a gun by
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
the end of the day
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
that might be too late if you've got a
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
domestic violence restraining order
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
against a person
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
um you could be like the woman in new
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
jersey who waited and waited and waited
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
she's now dead
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is being able to have
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
access to a life-saving self-defense
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
tool almost immediately for a
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
law-abiding person is the way it's
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
and the way it should continue to be
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
we hear statistics from some people that
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
97 percent of gun owners support these
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
type of checks and here's what i would
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask this committee whenever
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
witnesses tell you something like that
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
ask them to produce the study
 
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to suggest there is no such
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
study i keep up on a lot of statistics
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
and firearm owners and i've never seen
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
an academic
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
honest study that comes to those
 
01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:17.430 align:start position:0%
honest study that comes to those
conclusions

01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
conclusions
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
so in short this is a bill
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
that is a problem
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to disenfranchise a lot of
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
gun owners
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to make criminals out of
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
people who couldn't believe that
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
something's illegal when you give your
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
wife a firearm for christmas now you got
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
a problem you just broke the law there's
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
just a lot of unintended consequences
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
from this bill
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't see a problem that needs to
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
be solved
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is the reverse is true
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
you more than likely see people having
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
to spend hundreds and thousands of
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
dollars and wait for long periods of
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
time when they're wrongfully denied a
 
01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.390 align:start position:0%
time when they're wrongfully denied a
firearm

01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you are
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you so much for taking my
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
question do you know with 100 certainty
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
if the woman in new jersey already had a
 
01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.350 align:start position:0%
if the woman in new jersey already had a
gun

01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
gun
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i believe every newspaper
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
article said that she did not but i do
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
not know her personally and i didn't
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
know her personally but there's been
 
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
other cases where people were waiting
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
for firearms or not able to get firearms
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
and had problems in the domestic
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
violence context representative klein
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
knight you're recognized for a follow-up
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair so um i i do
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
hear a major concern with domestic
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
violence and as a domestic violence
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
champion myself i take it very serious
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
so when you say a lot of
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
women are waiting
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
to protect themselves do you have a
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
rough number of that exactly how many
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
women actually apply for guns and then
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
are waiting for them it depends on the
 
01:13:53.199 --> 01:13:54.390 align:start position:0%
are waiting for them it depends on the
state

01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
because what you're see or what this
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
bill rather suggests doing
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
is having the type of gun control
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that's available in several
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
let's say massachusetts which is not
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
known as the last bastion of freedom so
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
i don't think there are the other thing
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
is that women
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
initially when they are abused and leave
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
an abusive relationship i don't know
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
that they're signing up on sheets and

number i know from the number that call
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
me and those are that's a select group
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's not a statistically valid sample
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%

yes mr chairman and thank you
um

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen this bill many many times
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know there are small small changes
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
this time but it's still
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.189 align:start position:0%
the same
bill

01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know per se
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
that we've itled in the past
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
it just isn't going to fix anything
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
because you take a family member that
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
wants to give a
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
firearm to their grandson
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know that should be allowed
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know without a background because
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's what current law is and it's
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
i think criminals are going to
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
be criminals you know regardless of what
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
we pass you know look at chicago
 
01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
and you know they
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know more laws is not going to fix
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
some problem areas
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
where criminals just keep going to
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
certain parts of cities and just buy
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
illegal guns this is not going to fix
 
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:44.630 align:start position:0%
illegal guns this is not going to fix
that

01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
so this is just against law-abiding
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
citizens in my eyes and that's why i
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
support the itl and i hope you do too
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
i just want to bring
 
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
to the attention of the committee that
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
criminal justice
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
and public safety committee
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot of bills about
 
01:17:19.679 --> 01:17:21.510 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot of bills about
guns

01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
guns
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
we hear
 
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:24.870 align:start position:0%
we hear
arguments

01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
arguments
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
keep to protect a person's right
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
to defend themselves
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
we can't put any regulation
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
on the second amendment
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the constitution
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
or even
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
the amen the
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
article in the new hampshire
 
01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.430 align:start position:0%
article in the new hampshire
constitution

01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.709 align:start position:0%
constitution
that

01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
also is regulated
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
and the reason i brought up
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that the second half of the
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
is that we seldom hear about
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
article 3 of the new hampshire
 
01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.630 align:start position:0%
article 3 of the new hampshire
constitution

01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
and in that article it says
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
when men enter into a state of society
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
they surrender some of their national
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
rights their natural rights to that
 
01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.110 align:start position:0%
rights their natural rights to that
society

01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
society
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure the protection of
 
01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.470 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure the protection of
others

01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
we seldom hear about our constitutional
 
01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.709 align:start position:0%
we seldom hear about our constitutional
requirement

01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
for the safety of others
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
not only with guns
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
but also with things like health and
 
01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.390 align:start position:0%
but also with things like health and
others

01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
i heard some testimony today
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
about we can't let the feds do the
 
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
background check
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
because they can't do it right the feds
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
can't do anything right
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'm paraphrasing of course and maybe
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of hyperbole in
 
01:19:01.199 --> 01:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of hyperbole in
there

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
but the fact is that
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
the background check works we've heard
 
01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.070 align:start position:0%
the background check works we've heard
testimony

01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
about the percentages of people
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
who are prohibited persons
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
and they're prohibited because we can
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
regulate the second amendment and we
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
have regulated it
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
now it will only last until the supreme
 
01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.270 align:start position:0%
now it will only last until the supreme
court

01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.550 align:start position:0%
court
says

01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
that they're unconstitutional because
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
i believe that we have to follow supreme
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
court decisions even though i'm not
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
happy with the current makeup of the
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
supreme court i don't know what's going
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
to happen but by god i will fought i
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
will follow
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
what they say
 
01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.870 align:start position:0%
what they say
so

01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
i think that this is a modest bill
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's a modest bill that protects
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
the citizens of new hampshire and i
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
think that this bill ought to be passed
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i will oppose
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
propose the itl
 
01:19:57.199 --> 01:19:58.229 align:start position:0%
propose the itl
amendment

01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative roy you're recognized
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
my job as a state representative i'm
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
here for two things to solve problems
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
and protect the rights of the citizens
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
there has been no evidence presented to
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
this committee that we have a problem
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
with firearms in this state
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
therefore i resort to the second reason
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
i'm here and that's to protect the
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
rights of the citizens of this state and
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
i shall do so by voting this bill in
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
i plan once again on
 
01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.830 align:start position:0%
i plan once again on
supporting

01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill opposing the itl
 
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:56.629 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill opposing the itl
recommendation

01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
currently in our state
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
if what we require is uh anybody who
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
buying a firearm commercially from a
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
dealer is required to go through a
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
background check process
 
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:10.790 align:start position:0%
background check process
and

01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
that background check process actually
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
works pretty well
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
it makes sure that people who are
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
subject to protective orders aren't able
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
to buy firearms it flags people like
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
felons what it does is it makes sure
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
that people
 
01:21:26.159 --> 01:21:27.110 align:start position:0%
that people
who

01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
should not
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
be owning weapons
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
aren't able to simply walk into a store
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
put down a credit card and buy a deadly
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
weapon what we're talking about doing
 
01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:39.110 align:start position:0%
weapon what we're talking about doing
here

01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
is actually bringing that same
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
capability over to a private commercial
 
01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.270 align:start position:0%
capability over to a private commercial
sale

01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
sale
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
so when i put an ad in the newspaper or
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
i put an ad online
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
i have absolutely no idea who's going to
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
answer that ad who's going to walk in
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
through that door
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
i have no idea if they're
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
if they're a veteran if they're a police
 
01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:01.189 align:start position:0%
if they're a veteran if they're a police
officer

01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
or if they're a serial killer that's
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
killed a dozen people i have absolutely
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
no way of knowing that and that's one of
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we need a law like this
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
this is a huge
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
gap in public safety
 
01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.510 align:start position:0%
gap in public safety
this

01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
offers us the opportunity to close that
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
gap and this is something that we should
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain i know you had
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
your hand up do you still wish to speak
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
on the motion
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony that basically that
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
if we passed this bill that
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
we would no longer be able to transfer
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
firearms from
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
between family members
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out in the bill on
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
page two
 
01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.229 align:start position:0%
page two
starting

01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
starting
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
approximately line 30
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
exceptions this chapter shall not apply
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
to a non-commercial private cell
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
transfer or exchangeable firearm between
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
individuals provided another party to
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
neither of our transactions
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
person so
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
that exception uh
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
allows the trade of firearms to family
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
members if they
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote to id on the bill
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
not iddl but support the important thank
 
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
you representative boarding can you
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
repeat the page and line number again
 
01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:38.550 align:start position:0%
repeat the page and line number again
yes

01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
page 2
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
on exceptions
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
so if i could ask it says non-commercial
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
sales which i i understand that but on
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
the if you look at the
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
page 1 lines
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
11 and 12
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
somebody's asking how would you
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
interpret in consideration both what you
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
just read on page 2 lines 30 and page 1
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
lines 11 and 12.
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
the exception is clear
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
i do not i don't do not think that those
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
types of transactions are disqualified
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
but wouldn't that apply to
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
non-commercial sales
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
sorry wouldn't that apply to
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
non-commercial sales not commercial
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
sales where commercial sales a gift i
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
guess i was asking would apply to
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
commercial sales but we're talking about
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.239 --> 01:24:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.110 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
klein knight you're recognized
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
my job as a state representative is to
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
protect domestic violence citizens all
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
over the state and the mere
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
inconvenience of getting a third or
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
fifth gun
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
out is should be abhorrent that it
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
outweighs the fact that we should be
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
protecting lives and we should be caring
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
more about saving lives than collecting
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
personal arsenals this does not affect
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
your right to bear arms at all just your
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
right to make
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
suicide attempts more easier murders
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
more easier so i will be voting against
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
the itl motion and i urge my colleagues
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
in the committee to vote this motion
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
down so another more correct
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
motion can be made of ought to pass
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
conley you mr chairman
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
one thing that i think has been lost in
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
do people in the state want us to pass
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
this kind of law and poll after poll
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
after poll
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
has shown that new hampshire residents
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
support this law
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
and it's not by a plurality or a small
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
majority it's 88 and above it's 94 if
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
you count those who somewhat favor
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
we've heard from the gun lobbyists who
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
are paid to be here we know what they
 
01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.910 align:start position:0%
are paid to be here we know what they
think

01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:14.709 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
we now know that the broad majority of
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents support this
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
we should pass the bill as it has been
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
passed we know the governor supported it
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
before he was against it so i think he
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
was right the first time we should
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
oppose the motion make another one pass
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
and i'll just speak on this briefly and
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
for the members who were a member of the
 
01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.310 align:start position:0%
for the members who were a member of the
house

01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
last term may have recalled i said this
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
wealth right to my left over here
 
01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.189 align:start position:0%
wealth right to my left over here
that

01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
when we had a similar bill last term
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
it was presented to us that 99 of sales
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
are transfers to a person that would be
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited under law from possessing a
 
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.189 align:start position:0%
prohibited under law from possessing a
firearm

01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
99 of those were through either a straw
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
purchase which means they had
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
a third party purchase the firearm on
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
their behalf so they can
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
get around the background check or they
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
purchase it illegally in the black
 
01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.390 align:start position:0%
purchase it illegally in the black
market

01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
where this policy is dealing with the
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
one percent
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
so i hear a lot about public safety and
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're the criminal justice public safety
 
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.189 align:start position:0%
we're the criminal justice public safety
committee

01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
but we're dealing with
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
one percent of
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
firearm transactions that we're trying
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
to prevent not the 99 percent
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
so i feel this this misses
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
misses the point with that at least with
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
respect to that information
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%

and he's about ready to jump out of his
skin

01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
skin
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
because he had a bad morning
 
01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:06.870 align:start position:0%
because he had a bad morning
so

01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's an old dairy farm
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
no more dairy
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
they raised beef head
 
01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:13.910 align:start position:0%
they raised beef head
and

01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
the head were out
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
he was on the tractor
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
bringing him basically bringing him back
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
for breakfast
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
when he hears an earth-shattering kaboom
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
that makes him
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
jump a little bit in the seat of his
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
tractor because he recognizes the sound
 
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
and he realizes somebody just took a
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
shot pretty pretty close to where i am
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
and the tractor's running so to hear it
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
like that's a little discerning
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
and he looks
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
and here comes the guy across the field
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
walking essentially towards him
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
so he jumps off the tractor and
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know inquires as to what might be
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
and the gentleman explains that he had
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
been in the tree line turkey hunting
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
and turkey happened to come by
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
and he took the shot
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
challenge is if you stand or sit
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
this gentleman wasn't
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
tree-lined and i did that i went out
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
there i
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
saw the whole thing and the guy that
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
took the shot doesn't deny any of this
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
he was shooting at a turkey
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the backdrop
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
was a big red barn
 
01:35:28.639 --> 01:35:29.669 align:start position:0%
was a big red barn
with

01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know 20 to 40
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
head of beef cattle
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
out waiting for breakfast
 
01:35:36.239 --> 01:35:37.189 align:start position:0%
out waiting for breakfast
so

01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
my constituent's a reasonable guy
 
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
and the hunter says well you know i
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything wrong so
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
they call fish and game they call the
 
01:35:45.199 --> 01:35:46.470 align:start position:0%
they call fish and game they call the
police

01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
mission game shows up they interview the
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
guy you know everything stacks up just
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
like i told you and fishing games said
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah you know it's it's a legal shot and
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's nothing we can do
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
so the guy gets his turkey and off he
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
goes now
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
he wasn't within 300 feet of a building
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
that he didn't have permission to be on
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
the land because that's the current law
 
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.030 align:start position:0%
the land because that's the current law
right

01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
but he was shooting
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know when you when you take up a
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
firearm you're supposed to know your
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
target and what's beyond it and what was
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
beyond it was a big red barn and beef
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
cap and not too far off a guy on his
 
01:36:22.159 --> 01:36:23.590 align:start position:0%
cap and not too far off a guy on his
tractor

01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
tractor
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
and he was shooting in that general
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
direction so
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's right
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that shot should have
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
ever been taken
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
but that shot's a legal shot now we're
 
01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:35.990 align:start position:0%
but that shot's a legal shot now we're
lucky

01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
lucky
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
right we're lucky this guy was turkey on
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
he had a shotgun there's no way that
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
shot was going to make it to those cows
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
from where he took it okay
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
nobody disagrees with that my
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
constituent knows that i know that
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
probably most of you on this committee
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
if we close our eyes
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
and imagine a less experienced hunter
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
deer hunting that same property
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
with a rifle
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you've got a totally
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
totally different
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
set of what's going on
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
and the law doesn't differentiate
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
distance between shotgun
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
and rifle
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
under these conditions
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
so it's for that reason i filed this
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill to add part two to make it unlawful
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
for a person to discharge a firearm
 
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
in the direction of a building livestock
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
or pets we'll hear more about pets in a
 
01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:32.390 align:start position:0%
or pets we'll hear more about pets in a
bit

01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
bit
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
that are within eyesight of the person
 
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
discharging the firearm
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
whoever is found guilty of a first
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
offense under this paragraph shall have
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
their hunting license suspended for the
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
remainder of the year in which the
 
01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
offense occurred
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's pretty reasonable
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
whoever's found guilty of a second
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
offense under this paragraph shall lose
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
their hunting privileges in new
 
01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:58.470 align:start position:0%
their hunting privileges in new
hampshire

01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
for life
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
all right do it once shame on you do it
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
is this perfect as drafted
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
no so
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear testimony from
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
representatives of the akc
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
and they said well you know when we read
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
this and close our eyes what we see is
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
somebody rabbit hunting with with dogs
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
and you could argue that those hunting
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
dogs are pets
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
typically somewhere betwixt the firearm
 
01:38:31.119 --> 01:38:31.990 align:start position:0%
typically somewhere betwixt the firearm
and

01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
the target
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to find an amendment
 
01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.510 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to find an amendment
that'll

01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
that'll
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
define pet a little bit better so that
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
we don't accidentally ban
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
hunting for
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
pheasant rabbit bear whatever it is you
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
want to with dogs or whatever other
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
animal you might want to use to do that
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
that type of thing with
 
01:38:57.199 --> 01:38:58.470 align:start position:0%
that type of thing with
so

01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's something we're going to
 
01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
work on
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
but that's the impetus for the bill
 
01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.149 align:start position:0%
but that's the impetus for the bill
and

01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm here today that's why i
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
i hope the committee will support this
 
01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.430 align:start position:0%
i hope the committee will support this
bill

01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
we certainly do expect to bring an
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment in the near distant future to
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
make this bill a little bit better and
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
i'd love to work with the committee on
 
01:39:26.639 --> 01:39:27.590 align:start position:0%
i'd love to work with the committee on
that

01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
at this point i'll take any questions
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
if i let my dog out in the backyard
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
and i was looking through the glass door
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
and i see a coyote coming out of the
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
woods at it
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
would i have the right to shoot that
 
01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:54.070 align:start position:0%
would i have the right to shoot that
coyote

01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
coyote
 
01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative for the
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
question it's a great question
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
my answer is yes
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
my answer is yes
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why we need an amendment i
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
think we need an amendment to clean up
 
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
um who's whose pet we're referring to
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
in this in this bill so i think what we
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
need to do is clean it up to say uh in
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
the direction of another person's pet
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
for which the
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
the shooter doesn't have permission to
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
be using that pet for the purposes of
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
hunting um so that it's clear that we're
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
so i agree that we need an amendment to
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
make that part better in fact you know
 
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:38.950 align:start position:0%
make that part better in fact you know
if

01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
i want to put ideas in people's heads
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
because i love my bill if we dropped pet
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
from this bill
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think it would be sufficient to meet
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
the desire of my constituent and i
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
certainly could
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
could go down that path to simply scrub
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
pet from the bill if that's if that's
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
the quickest cleanest way to to get it
 
01:40:59.119 --> 01:41:01.669 align:start position:0%
the quickest cleanest way to to get it
done

01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony witness is
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
excused thank you
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls joe hannon gynos
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh good morning again thank you for
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
having us here today and thank you for
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
listening uh joe hannan the vice
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
president for gunners of new hampshire
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh we're in opposition to this bill not
 
01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:29.990 align:start position:0%
uh we're in opposition to this bill not
that

01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
we don't think it's a good idea we don't
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea to shoot in the
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
direction of any of these things but
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's already uh it's against the law to
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
shoot someone's pet to shoot someone's
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
livestock uh to shoot at their home
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
these are all things that are already
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
illegal if you actually shoot and hit
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
these things you can be criminally
 
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
liable and also civilly liable if you do
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
any damage to someone's personal
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
property or
 
01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:50.709 align:start position:0%
property or
um

01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:50.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
pets and livestock
 
01:41:52.159 --> 01:41:53.109 align:start position:0%
pets and livestock
um

01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
there's also some just like we heard
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
from the sponsor there are some things
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
that need to be changed like hunting
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
retrievers would be one example you know
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
retrievers are often in front of you but
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
not you're not pointing at them or
 
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
aiming at them you're aiming in the sky
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
but the retriever is often in front of
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
you or near you or within eyesight of
 
01:42:09.199 --> 01:42:09.990 align:start position:0%
you or near you or within eyesight of
you

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:10.950 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
that would be a very big problem
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
also it says
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
discharge a firearm when used for
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
hunting purposes in the direction of
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to say within
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
eyesight of the person discharging the
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
firearm well direction and eyesight are
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the same thing and how
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
do we define that
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
i am
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the chair who is in
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
directly in front of me that's the
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
direction but all of you are in eyesight
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
and i can actually see
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
the other microphone from here in my in
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
my eyesight even with the glasses i've
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
got pretty decent peripheral vision so i
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
can't shoot anything from that way all
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
the way over as far as i can see so if i
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
see a cow
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
over there
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
three miles away i would not be allowed
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
to hunt the deer who was right in front
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
of me not not you but uh you know that
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
would be a problem so i don't think the
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
language is very clear
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
um and also the i said the person
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
discharging the firearm you're gonna
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
have to get the the person uh filing the
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
charge the officer will have to go out
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
and actually have to
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
sit in the exact same spot now this is
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
not a big problem but what if the vision
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
what do you do about vision differences
 
01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
some people may have better vision
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
others so someone who has poor vision
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
and can't see 300 yards very clearly and
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
they're shooting something 50 feet in
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
front of them
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
are we going to hold that person to a
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
different standard because it's their
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
vision that we're talking about their
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
their eyesight
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
so i think there are several problems
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
and i ask you to please it all this bill
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the witness
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
we now call colonel kevin jordan new
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair and honorable
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
members of the criminal justice
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for allowing me to
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
testify today the commission and the
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
department reviewed this law very
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
carefully because we certainly are the
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
ones that as you've already heard
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are held responsible
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
for enforcing this type of thing we have
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues with this
 
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
as it's written i think it creates a
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
number of problems that i want to come
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
today and make you aware the first one i
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
will tell you is that we aggressively
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
very aggressively enforce the 300 foot
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
rule it's a safety concern for us we get
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of calls on it not a lot of calls
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
but we get a number of calls and we and
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
i have mandated that each officer take
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
that very seriously because i don't want
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
people afraid i don't want people
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
fearing hearing a gunshot we live in new
 
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire and in the month of november
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
you hear a lot of gunshots
 
01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:44.310 align:start position:0%
you hear a lot of gunshots
um

01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
and we i am very confident when i tell
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
you that we are very strict on it and we
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
make a few cases on it and we convict
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
people of it and we do that because it
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
was a well-crafted piece of legislation
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's easy to prove you have certain
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
elements involving distance which takes
 
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
out a lot of the questions that you just
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
heard presented very well
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
regarding direction of sight and proving
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
that someone was seeing something that's
 
01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
very difficult if you can imagine to do
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
in a courtroom and when that's in a bill
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
you have that becomes an element you
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
have to prove it
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
the other problem with this bill is
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
there is no legal definition
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
in our statutes for hunting so hunting
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
falls undertaking
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
our definitions under 2071 in
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
undertaking describe the act of hunting
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the problem with that is they
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
include a lot of other things under that
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
same definition some of the things are
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
included in that shooting
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
killing capturing trapping snaring
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
pursuing worrying harassing wounding so
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
all of those actions would fall under
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
that definition it would prevent
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative green
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh what you just asked would be illegal
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
under this statute
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
the other thing that's concerning to me
 
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
is property rights people's property
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
rights so right now i have farmers
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
that we work with on a regular basis and
 
01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
i think i don't want to steal the
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
thunder i think you're going to hear
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
some of this today but a farmer has the
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
right or any landowner has a right to
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
protect their property be it their
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
domestic dog
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
chickens in a coop
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
all of those things and we have provided
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
we the legislature has provided them and
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
fish and game the right to protect those
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
animals and i think that's an important
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
right that landowners should have they
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to stand by and watch
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
their their animals get decimated by a
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
by a bear which happens on occasion
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
or a bobcat what happens typically
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
they'll make a call to us to respond to
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
that by the time i get there they could
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
lose a lot of livestock so they are
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
permitted through law
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
under under careful conditions to
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
dispatch that animal and call us and
 
01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:43.590 align:start position:0%
dispatch that animal and call us and
report

01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
that um act this law would prevent that
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
they would not be allowed to do that
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
there's no provision in here for a
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
landowner to do that
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
the other technical the other point that
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
i want to bring out to you i think
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
people forget about we have a lot of
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
laws to address the discharge of a
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
firearm in an unsafe manner they include
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
prohibitions which is a 300-foot rule
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
that we use on a regular basis which all
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
of all hunting offenses in the state of
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire come with a year loss of
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
license second offense is a three-year
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
loss of license
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
we have negligent discharge of a firearm
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
which specifically talks about shooting
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
or placing people in danger or shooting
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
at people's properties we have reckless
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
conduct which is used and it becomes a
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
felony class b felony if a person uses a
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon and places someone in in
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
danger of imminent serious bodily injury
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
we have criminal mischief which is a
 
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
class b felony if you discharge a
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
firearm at an occupied structure
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
we have unauthorized use of a firearm
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
which covers the compact zones the areas
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
of small neighborhoods or close
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods where it would be unsafe
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
to shoot so there are a lot of existing
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
laws now both in criminal code and
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
and in chapter 18 fish and game statutes
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
that address this
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
so i feel that it is adequate adequately
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
addressed and then finally the other
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
technical diff dif conflict in this
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
current change that's proposed
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
under fishing game and that would be the
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
loss of license so the loss of license i
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
think in the proposed bill would be a uh
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
the rest of the year
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
which happens anyway the following year
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
which would be automatic under statute
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
and then a second offense would be loss
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
of your license for life where you don't
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
have any statute no i'm sufficient gain
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
believe it or not where people lose
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
their license for life even shooting a
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
human being
 
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
they are entitled after a 10-year
 
01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:36.790 align:start position:0%
they are entitled after a 10-year
suspension

01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
suspension
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
to reapply after hunter safety and
 
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
making some amends to get their license
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
back so that would conflict with current
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
statutes that are very specific on how
 
01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
we lose our license in a length of time
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
so based on all of those facts
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
i would ask you to
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
consider itlling this bill thank you
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative rory
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
if you heard the uh the scenario that
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
the representative gave
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
would that have fallen under the
 
01:49:08.719 --> 01:49:09.750 align:start position:0%
would that have fallen under the
reckless

01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
reckless
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
use of a firearm where where he fired
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
discharged it towards a barn you would
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
have to prove uh a couple of things you
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
would have to prove that it that that
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
act placed someone or the property in
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
danger and from what i'm hearing and
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
again we're
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
it as you know it's hard to to second
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
guess when you don't have all the facts
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you from doing this for
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
three decades there's three sides to
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
every story and the truth lies somewhere
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
there in the middle
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
but if you could and i am confident if
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
one of my officers went there and felt
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
that someone was in danger by that shot
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
they would have taken steps to address
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
it we do that regularly so while that is
 
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:47.430 align:start position:0%
it we do that regularly so while that is
um

01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know that gunshot i'm sure
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
frightened that farmer i'm sure it
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
concerned him because this guy is you
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
know within sight of him but i i am
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
confident if there was danger a reckless
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
reckless act that they would have been
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
charged with so my answer to that would
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
be i don't think it meant that from what
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
i heard i don't think it meant the
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
elements to be proven thank you
 
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you and justin
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to your answer there if
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
if that wayward shot had had hit a pet
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
or hit
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
the way things that are described in
 
01:50:25.599 --> 01:50:26.629 align:start position:0%
the way things that are described in
this

01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
law would your office have been been
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
able to then make a charge on that if
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
you had evidence that in fact
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
the shot did
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
hit one of them absolutely absolutely
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's clear there's several uh statutes
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
that he could choose depending on the
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
elements matt but yes we would have the
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
ability to charge for that uh we have
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
currently i worked on a case this
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
morning where where an individual's dog
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
was shot
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
by an angry hunter
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
and he was charged with with a felony
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
and facing charges for that
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative newman you're recognized
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up listen could you could
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
you just clear up for me as a matter of
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
fact i live in a city
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
but i do know about the 300 foot
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
yes law and as i recall off the top of
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
my head
 
01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
there is some limitation on that you had
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
to have a certain number of houses or
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
something within a proximity is there a
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
limitation on that so so there's two
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
laws represented that would cover that
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
so we have a law to which is prohibition
 
01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:24.020 align:start position:0%
so we have a law to which is prohibition

[Music]
 
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
2073 i believe it is
 
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.350 align:start position:0%
2073 i believe it is
that

01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
does it 3a which which says
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
you cannot discharge a firearm or a bow
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
any kind of a firearm or a bow within
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
300 feet of a permanently occupied
 
01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:41.030 align:start position:0%
300 feet of a permanently occupied
dwelling

01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
dwelling
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
unless you have permission from the land
 
01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
owner that you're shooting from
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
the other law that would address that is
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
the compact area so that that was born
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
because of some issues we had with duck
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
hunters on the coast
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
where you have smaller neighborhoods and
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
we define what we the legislature
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
defined a compact zone and a compact
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
zone is six or more continuous homes or
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
occupier dwellings within 300 feet of
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
each other and a 300 foot rule around
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
that so it basically eliminated the
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
hunting in a in a
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
condensed neighborhood
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
also one of my concerns about this bill
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
is this bill would eliminate hunting in
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
a good portion of the state of new
 
01:52:27.199 --> 01:52:28.470 align:start position:0%
a good portion of the state of new
hampshire

01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
because there's places you can see homes
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
a half a mile away and if this bill were
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
to pass even though that round would
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
would be very unlikely to reach there it
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
would end the ability to hunt in that
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
area so that's very concerning to us
 
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the information
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony sir
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
i know a lot of people in goffstown use
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
the rail trail i have chickens so what
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying is in we see houses
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
everywhere sure
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
and we do have koi dogs
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
other animals that attack small
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
chickens and small dogs you know i hear
 
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
about it every now and then or even they
 
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
take cats so if we saw that with this
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
bill passed we wouldn't be able to
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
protect that animal by shooting the
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
bad animal
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
to protect the uh that's correct the way
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
i'm reading that i don't believe you
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
would be able to do that all right thank
 
01:53:26.159 --> 01:53:30.070 align:start position:0%
would be able to do that all right thank
you

01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%

of the sportsman's alliance um we have a
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
memo that was submitted by our
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
consultants at sportsman's alliance that
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'll be reading aloud um don't mind me
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
i'm a little nervous this is the first
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
time i've
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
spoke in front of this many people
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
dear members of the house criminal

justice and public safety committee on
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
behalf of hunters in new hampshire and
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
sportsmen and women across the country
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
the sportsman's alliance asked you to
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
oppose house bill 1310
 
01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
which could end untold hunting
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities across new hampshire
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
house bill 1310 would prohibit hunters
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
from discharging a firearm in the
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
direction of any buildings livestock or
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
pets within their eyesight no matter how
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
far away
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is worded ambiguously and could
 
01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:35.679 align:start position:0%
be utilized to stop virtually any
 
01:54:35.679 --> 01:54:36.709 align:start position:0%
be utilized to stop virtually any
hunting

01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
hunting
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
depending on the terrain and the weather
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
condition a person can see buildings or
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
livestock in fields at distances of far
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
more than a mile and certainly far
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
beyond the range of hunting rifles
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't make any delineation
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
between a rifle and a shotgun which has
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
an even shorter range
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
further the bill prohibits shooting in
 
01:54:57.510 --> 01:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
the direction of a visible pet and makes
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
no exception for a hunting dog
 
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
both bird and rabbit hunters commonly
 
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
and safely shoot in the same direction
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
as pursuing as a pursuing hunting dog
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
that has successfully flushed game
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
there are also genuine questions about
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
the necessity for this type of
 
01:55:12.159 --> 01:55:13.430 align:start position:0%
the necessity for this type of
legislation

01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
hunting is remarkably safe
 
01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
for example a person is 11 times more
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
likely to be injured while playing
 
01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:20.629 align:start position:0%
likely to be injured while playing
volleyball

01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
volleyball
 
01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
19 times more likely to be injured while
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
snowboarding i have
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
25 times more likely to be injured
 
01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
cheerleading or bicycle riding
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
35 times more likely to be injured
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
playing soccer or skateboarding also
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
done that
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
105 more times likely to be injured
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
playing tackle football
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
hunters take safely extremely seriously
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
and have spearheaded laws that maintain
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
hunter education apprentice hunting and
 
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
blaze orange requirements
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
this shared commitment is what has made
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
hunting one of the safest recreational
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
activities in the country including new
 
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.270 align:start position:0%
activities in the country including new
hampshire

01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
hb 1310 would severely restrict hunting
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities without justification
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
hunter safety works best through
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
continued education
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
for these reasons the sportsman's
 
01:56:05.669 --> 01:56:05.679 align:start position:0%
alliance asked the members of the house
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and public safety
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee to oppose this legislation
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
i wanted to further speak
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
as a hunter myself
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is a letter of course i'm up here
 
01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
reading from the sportsman's alliance
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
i'm actually personally a
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
massachusetts resident don't hold that
 
01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
against me
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
i grew up coming to new hampshire every
 
01:56:30.070 --> 01:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
single year as a child and now that i'm
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
a hunter i come up here as well to enjoy
 
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and hopefully at some
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
point in the near future i will be
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
making the obvious upgrade to becoming a
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%

and it has become an absolute wonderful
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
tradition in our family
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
and we just got a new little setter just
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
before christmas named piper
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
now as
 
01:57:13.199 --> 01:57:14.149 align:start position:0%
now as
um

01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
you all mostly know and how we read in
 
01:57:18.149 --> 01:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
our letter
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
this bill wouldn't take into any account
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
for hunting over these hunting
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
dogs it's my little picture of our
 
01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:29.030 align:start position:0%
dogs it's my little picture of our
family

01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
as you know this is a very important
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
part of our heritage as hunters
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much all we do in our family
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
to spend time together to spend time
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
with our dogs who are not only pets
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
they're part of the family and they're
 
01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs
 
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
and so personally just from myself as
 
01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:45.589 align:start position:0%
and so personally just from myself as
well

01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
i urge you to oppose this bill thank you
 
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
the witness is excused
 
01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls stacy ober
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman abbas and members
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is stacey ober
 
01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
i am the legislative liaison for the
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
american kennel club here in new england
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
and i want to just acknowledge that we
 
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
have serious concerns about house bill
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
1310 is written
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
you've heard some of those concerns
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
expressed already so i'll just
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
the american kennel club is a
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
135 year old not not-for-profit
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
organization we represent 5 000 dog
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
clubs across the country
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
including 14 here in new hampshire
 
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
our concern with the bill is that it
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
does not distinguish between
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs and
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
who also are our companion animals the
 
01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:54.390 align:start position:0%
who also are our companion animals the
akc

01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
akc
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
encourages and strongly supports the
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
interaction and mutual enjoyment of
 
01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
sporting activities
 
01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
by owners with their dogs
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
and in 2019 for instance
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
we sanctioned 141 events in new
 
01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire in which more than 24
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
300 dogs participated
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
so we're very concerned about
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
language in the bill as filed perhaps
 
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
having a chilling effect on those who
 
01:59:27.669 --> 01:59:27.679 align:start position:0%
engage and enjoy in those types of
 
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
canine sporting activities that include
 
01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
hunting field trials
 
01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:33.589 align:start position:0%
hunting field trials
agility

01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
agility
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
and other performance events
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your consideration
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the witness
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls robert johnson
 
01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
bureau thank you mr chair and members of
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is

rob johnson and i'm here representing
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire farm bureau as a
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
federation's policy director farm bureau
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
is a federation of new hampshire's ten

county farm bureau organizations
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%

memberships and another 1 000 other
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
types of members supporting and such and
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
we are in in opposition to the bill is
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
drafted you've heard in different ways
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
many of our concerns in particular there
 
02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
are no provisions in the bill for
 
02:00:25.599 --> 02:00:27.510 align:start position:0%
are no provisions in the bill for
landowners

02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
landowners
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
on their own property as a particular
 
02:00:31.589 --> 02:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
concern as was alluded to earlier as
 
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
well again as it's been alluded to
 
02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.589 align:start position:0%
well again as it's been alluded to
earlier

02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
hunting is not defined in statute and
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
we're concerned what does this mean for
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
any landowner protecting their their own
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
livestock or animals
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
we also have concerns with the phrasing
 
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
within eyesight
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
as you've heard earlier it means
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
different things to different people
 
02:00:51.119 --> 02:00:53.030 align:start position:0%
different things to different people
and

02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
in our discussions with fishing game and
 
02:00:56.709 --> 02:00:56.719 align:start position:0%
appears and statue
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
currently covers what's needed to be
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
covered so with that i'll leave it and
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the witness
 
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
is excused
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
david leroux um
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
i'm actually
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
not a hunter with the state just because
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
i don't have enough time because of all
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
the things i have to do but i am a
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
landowner and uh i'm currently building
 
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
a farm i own 83 acres
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
so there's obviously problems with
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
provisions on defining hunting
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
the direction seems very vague to me
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
that's very different than act
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
we had talk about the different statutes
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
that already cover actual uh breaking of
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
the actual laws about actually causing
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
harm intent all those things that i'm
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
not the expert at but he spoke well on
 
02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:58.390 align:start position:0%
not the expert at but he spoke well on
um

02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:58.400 --> 02:01:59.669 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
beyond the subjectiveness of this
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
i would agree that losing your hunting
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
license for life um because i plan to
 
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
get my hunting license and somebody who
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
is an avid hunter many people that i
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
know from the north country they use
 
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
hunting as a primary means of um
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
getting their food
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
i actually know many people who that's
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
one of their primary ways of getting
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
their meat and if you haven't bought
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
groceries in a while i can tell you what
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
meat costs so somebody who has time and
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
wants to get meat should be allowed that
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
um with the subjective and somewhat
 
02:02:29.679 --> 02:02:30.709 align:start position:0%
um with the subjective and somewhat
vague

02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
vague
 
02:02:32.790 --> 02:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
criteria in this
 
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
then it would be very open to the
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
possibility that somebody who did not
 
02:02:38.709 --> 02:02:38.719 align:start position:0%
have ill intent and somebody who did not
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
actually violate any of the other
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
current existing rules could possibly um
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
and or if their hunting area typically
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
involves buildings that are within
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
eyesight again very broad i can see
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
houses from over a mile away from where
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
i live
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
that they could possibly lose their
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
license for life i think that's way over
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
the top
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
also there's the question that if we
 
02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
have somebody who is a landowner or a
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
farmer who has animals that could be at
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
risk it's up to their responsibility
 
02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not they want to post their
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
land to prevent hunting on their land
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
you can also as i understand it post
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
land and still maintain current use uh
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
standards of tax breaks within uh
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
criteria because there's recreational
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
use you can disallow hunting on your
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
property and still have
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
landowner permission landowners can
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
shoot and do what they need to in
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
defense of their animals um the problems
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
are many with this and as a landowner
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
who is building a barn to eventually
 
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
have cows in we already have chickens
 
02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
and as a landowner who has had over a
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
dozen chickens killed in about five
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
minutes from a black bear at my previous
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
residence in campton i can tell you this
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you again for hearing
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
my testimony i'm still from concord and
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
i want to make it clear i'm not being
 
02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
paid as a lobbyist
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
no one's paying me to be here i'm
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
strictly on behalf of myself it actually
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
cost me money i lose income to be here
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i can tell you that i certainly have
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
strong feelings this bill needs to be
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
itl for several reasons first of all
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
if the introducing speaker is correct
 
02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
and i make no opinion nor disperse them
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
the particular troopers and fish and
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
game officers really need to be sent
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
back to the police academy because they
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
missed their classes that day
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
because if it was as said
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
631 one three would take care of it
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of statutes that would
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
allow for criminal charges for the
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
situation as mentioned
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
they're in place
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
tons of them i could spend hours lifting
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
them off you it's not a good time bit of
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
your time to listen
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
but more importantly
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
vague terms invite abuse
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
and there are more vague terms in this
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill than carter has pills
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
and when i think about defending or
 
02:05:27.199 --> 02:05:28.229 align:start position:0%
and when i think about defending or
proving

02:05:28.229 --> 02:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
proving
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
or disproving as a practical matter
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
a case
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
when we have things like pets
 
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
i didn't notice your pet i thought it
 
02:05:38.790 --> 02:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
was a wild dog
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know wild cat wild whatever
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
um eyesight again whose eyesight are we
 
02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
talking about with or without glasses
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
and so i just see this bill as being not
 
02:05:51.199 --> 02:05:52.310 align:start position:0%
and so i just see this bill as being not
needed

02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
if the statute of limitations hasn't
 
02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:55.830 align:start position:0%
if the statute of limitations hasn't
passed

02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
they should go check again with the
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
person who was shot near and see if
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
there can be a remedy done or was this
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
person just overly sensitive to a
 
02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
shotgun that went off 100 yards away you
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
know we don't know but everything
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
should not
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
be taken and said we're going to pass a
 
02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
new law when what i see happening here
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
is just abuses being heaped on and quite
 
02:06:19.679 --> 02:06:20.709 align:start position:0%
is just abuses being heaped on and quite
frankly

02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:20.719 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
leading to a lot of troubles both for
 
02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and citizens because i
 
02:06:26.550 --> 02:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
pity the poor law enforcement officer or
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
fish and game officer that would try to
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
enforce or even interpret the statute
 
02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:33.910 align:start position:0%
enforce or even interpret the statute
and

02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
so therefore i'm happy to answer any
 
02:06:38.950 --> 02:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
questions but i go back to 630 131 place
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
another in danger of serious bodily
 
02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:42.229 align:start position:0%
another in danger of serious bodily
injury

02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
injury
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
like i said there's a plethora of
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
statutes and if in fact
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
those that responded didn't know maybe
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
they do need remedial education i don't
 
02:06:50.719 --> 02:06:52.149 align:start position:0%
they do need remedial education i don't
know

02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to answer any questions
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
about it
 
02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
or about practical application of this i
 
02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
just think there is none
 
02:07:04.709 --> 02:07:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the witness
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now close the
 
02:07:48.149 --> 02:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now open the
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative burt you wish to be
 
02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:59.030 align:start position:0%
representative burt you wish to be

02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%

02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
i would like to make a motion for house
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%

02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:10.000 align:start position:0%

02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
is there second seconded by
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:16.069 --> 02:08:16.079 align:start position:0%
representative burke do you wish to
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
we've heard all the testimony
 
02:08:23.679 --> 02:08:26.310 align:start position:0%
we've heard all the testimony
um

02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
i guess the you know other than the
 
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
testimony which was great uh to be
 
02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's three key things that really
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
stuck to me from the prime sponsor was
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
the farmer did not see the shot
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
he didn't see the gentleman shooting the
 
02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:42.870 align:start position:0%
he didn't see the gentleman shooting the
gun

02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
gun
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
so he really doesn't know where it was
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
shooting i mean he knows where the
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
turkey was and where the barn was and
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
where the
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
beef cow were
 
02:08:53.669 --> 02:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
and from what i also understood is that
 
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
everybody agreed that
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
the shot was a safe shot
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
it might have been disturbing to the
 
02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
individual and i'm sorry for that but it
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
was a safe shot because it was
 
02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:04.470 align:start position:0%
was a safe shot because it was
determined

02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
determined
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
everybody agreed that the beef cows in
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
the barn were not going to be hit by
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
and they also said that this bill is not
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
perfectly drafted and that is very true
 
02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
i've looked at this bill to see if we
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
could fix it and there's really no
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
fixing it because current laws
 
02:09:29.310 --> 02:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
protect all the scenarios of a
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
misplaced shocked
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know which is very rare from what i
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
understand in new hampshire
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
so for that reasons
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
and all the great testimony we just
 
02:09:39.599 --> 02:09:40.390 align:start position:0%
and all the great testimony we just
heard

02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
i will be supporting the itl of 1310

02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
at this time the matter will now be put
 
02:09:56.229 --> 02:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
to question if you were in support of
 
02:09:58.470 --> 02:09:58.480 align:start position:0%

mr chairman
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
house bill 1178
 
02:31:56.710 --> 02:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
is a
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
easy clean
 
02:32:01.270 --> 02:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
common sense bill
 
02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
it prohibits
 
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
the state from enforcing any federal
 
02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
statute as you said regulation
 
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
presidential executive order that
 
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
restricts or regulates the right of the
 
02:32:20.790 --> 02:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire
 
02:32:27.190 --> 02:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
i always feel that local police should
 
02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:30.950 align:start position:0%
i always feel that local police should
enforce

02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:32.070 align:start position:0%
enforce
local

02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
laws here in new hampshire
 
02:32:37.270 --> 02:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
the state police and local police should
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
not be doing the federal
 
02:32:41.270 --> 02:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
government's job because then we have to
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
02:32:44.469 --> 02:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
the federal government has more money
 
02:32:46.630 --> 02:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
than they can handle
 
02:32:48.790 --> 02:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
and if they don't have enough money
 
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
they just print more
 
02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
so they have
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
the money to enforce any laws that they
 
02:32:58.389 --> 02:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
wish to enforce
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
and that's all this bill does it's very
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
02:33:05.830 --> 02:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
so i hope everybody will vote for it
 
02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:07.510 align:start position:0%
so i hope everybody will vote for it
because

02:33:07.510 --> 02:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
if the federal government wants to come
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire and enforce any of
 
02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
their laws
 
02:33:13.270 --> 02:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
let them
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
but they're not going to have the help
 
02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
of our local and state police thank you
 
02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
02:33:21.670 --> 02:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
chairman you're sitting in the speaker's
 
02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:23.510 align:start position:0%
chairman you're sitting in the speaker's
chair

02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:33:29.349 --> 02:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:32.389 --> 02:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
you are excused representative thank you
 
02:33:34.230 --> 02:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls representative
 
02:33:39.830 --> 02:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm going to make
 
02:33:43.910 --> 02:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
my remarks very very brief um as as i
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
think probably all the committee knows
 
02:33:47.590 --> 02:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a
 
02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
this we went through this exercise
 
02:33:49.439 --> 02:33:50.630 align:start position:0%
this we went through this exercise
before

02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:33:52.469 --> 02:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
last year
 
02:33:54.070 --> 02:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
i support
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
i support this bill
 
02:33:59.830 --> 02:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
but i think that it needs to have
 
02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
a section two
 
02:34:04.389 --> 02:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
which which sort of defines the
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
limitations of the bill
 
02:34:09.349 --> 02:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
because if you just if you just pass
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
and you don't do anything else
 
02:34:15.510 --> 02:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
there will be an argument what happens
 
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
you know very frequent circumstance
 
02:34:22.710 --> 02:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
where there is
 
02:34:24.389 --> 02:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
a violation
 
02:34:24.399 --> 02:34:26.070 align:start position:0%
a violation
of

02:34:26.070 --> 02:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
the police are investigating or federal
 
02:34:29.830 --> 02:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
agents and the local police are
 
02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:31.429 align:start position:0%
agents and the local police are
investigating

02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
investigating
 
02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
a number of violations committed by or
 
02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
allegedly committed by somebody
 
02:34:39.349 --> 02:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
some of which may be only a violation of
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
federal law where there's no
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
counterpart state law some of which may
 
02:34:46.389 --> 02:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
be a violation of only state law where
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
there's no counterpart federal law and
 
02:34:50.309 --> 02:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
some of which may be
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
of a
 
02:34:53.670 --> 02:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
conduct that could arguably violate both
 
02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
laws like for example
 
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
drug offenses
 
02:34:59.110 --> 02:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
if you don't put in
 
02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
a section that was in the bill
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
last year that's that basically says
 
02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
what happens in those circumstances
 
02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
you can you you
 
02:35:11.910 --> 02:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
the bill is interpret is open to to both
 
02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:13.349 align:start position:0%
the bill is interpret is open to to both
interpretations

02:35:13.349 --> 02:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
interpretations
 
02:35:15.510 --> 02:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
somebody could say some local official
 
02:35:16.950 --> 02:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
could say well
 
02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
you know we've been asked to participate
 
02:35:21.270 --> 02:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
with the federal government in a in an
 
02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:22.870 align:start position:0%
with the federal government in a in an
investigation

02:35:22.870 --> 02:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
part of which
 
02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
involves a violation only of federal gun
 
02:35:29.030 --> 02:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
laws that where there's no equivalent
 
02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
we read this bill we read this bill if
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
it becomes law to say we can't do that
 
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
we cannot
 
02:35:41.429 --> 02:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
participate some other local official
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
might say well yes
 
02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
it you know but there are other
 
02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
violations here so we can participate
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
because there are other violations of
 
02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
law and there's no prohibition on that
 
02:35:53.990 --> 02:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that's the kind of
 
02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.270 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that's the kind of
uncertainty

02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
uncertainty
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
that you don't want to have
 
02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
i know there was a language and i'm i i
 
02:36:02.469 --> 02:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
actually still have the language i'm
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
happy to submit it to the committee um
 
02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.110 align:start position:0%
happy to submit it to the committee um
uh

02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:36:09.590 --> 02:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
that from from uh last year
 
02:36:12.389 --> 02:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh talking about
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
the the fact that
 
02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
this the intent of this bill and i think
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
i assume that that is the intent but if
 
02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm you know if if
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong i suppose somebody will
 
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
tell me but i assume it's the intent not
 
02:36:26.309 --> 02:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
to prohibit
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
the local authorities from participating
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
in investigations where it's
 
02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
it's something other than solely a
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
violation of a federal gun law that
 
02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any state
 
02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
counterpart because
 
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
if if the intent
 
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
were to were to make it broader than
 
02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:46.469 align:start position:0%
were to were to make it broader than
that

02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
i mean you that's
 
02:36:50.230 --> 02:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that is would be a real
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
problem because there are all kinds of
 
02:36:55.190 --> 02:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
investigations going on
 
02:36:56.790 --> 02:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
in this state and other states where
 
02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:03.270 --> 02:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
violations of law where state and where
 
02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
you want to encourage the state and the
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
federal government to cooperate with
 
02:37:08.469 --> 02:37:08.479 align:start position:0%
each other i mean and that's why i think
 
02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
you need
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh some language in there that that uh
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
that makes it clear that that kind of
 
02:37:16.870 --> 02:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
cooperation is not prohibited the other
 
02:37:18.150 --> 02:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
the other point the other two points
 
02:37:20.469 --> 02:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
i'll make very quickly is that and it's
 
02:37:20.479 --> 02:37:21.590 align:start position:0%
i'll make very quickly is that and it's
probably

02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh it should be obvious
 
02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:26.230 align:start position:0%
uh it should be obvious
this

02:37:26.230 --> 02:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:37:29.349 --> 02:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
this bill as as drafted if it passes it
 
02:37:30.790 --> 02:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
has no teeth
 
02:37:32.550 --> 02:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
there are no provisions in this bill
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
that say what happens
 
02:37:36.070 --> 02:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
let's assume
 
02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
that some that there is a case in which
 
02:37:41.110 --> 02:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
the only thing that is
 
02:37:42.309 --> 02:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
that the federal government is
 
02:37:44.389 --> 02:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
investigating is a violation of federal
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
gun laws where there's no equivalent
 
02:37:49.830 --> 02:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
state violation and so
 
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
this law if it were enacted would say
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
the states can't cooperate
 
02:37:56.070 --> 02:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
suppose they do
 
02:37:59.190 --> 02:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
suppose a police chief
 
02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
decides that he wants to cooperate
 
02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
and he does
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
what's the remedy this bill doesn't say
 
02:38:09.429 --> 02:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
any evidence that's ex that's gathered
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
as a result of that investigation can't
 
02:38:14.309 --> 02:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
be used in state court it doesn't say
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
that the police chief who authorizes the
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
cooperation can be disciplined or a
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
police officer who does that can be
 
02:38:20.319 --> 02:38:21.349 align:start position:0%
police officer who does that can be
disciplined

02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
disciplined
 
02:38:21.359 --> 02:38:22.230 align:start position:0%
disciplined
so

02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:23.910 --> 02:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's
 
02:38:26.070 --> 02:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
i think the reality is that this is kind
 
02:38:27.510 --> 02:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
of a
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
if you pay if we pass this law and
 
02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else in it you've kind
 
02:38:31.910 --> 02:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
of made a public statement you've sort
 
02:38:33.910 --> 02:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
of declared you know this is what the
 
02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
legislature thinks but you haven't given
 
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
it any teeth because there's no
 
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
you might want to think about whether
 
02:38:41.830 --> 02:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
there should be some enforcement
 
02:38:44.550 --> 02:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism if we really mean what we say
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
maybe there should be some provision
 
02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
that creates an exclusionary rule
 
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
if if there's a violation or allows the
 
02:38:54.389 --> 02:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
you know whoever violates it some state
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
official to be in some way disciplined
 
02:38:59.750 --> 02:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's something i think you may
 
02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
want to think about but
 
02:39:03.590 --> 02:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's about really that's about all i
 
02:39:05.429 --> 02:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
have i'm happy to answer questions if
 
02:39:09.990 --> 02:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
 
02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:13.110 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
recognized

02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
i have some confusion about the law and
 
02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
what you just testified to and maybe you
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
could help me clear that up by
 
02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
a law that i that i think about where i
 
02:39:30.630 --> 02:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
i don't have the legal expertise to even
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
know if i'm saying this right
 
02:39:36.550 --> 02:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
where we talk about guns in a school
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
and that there is a federal law that
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
applies in those cases
 
02:39:44.309 --> 02:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
but there is no for people of 18 i
 
02:39:44.319 --> 02:39:45.349 align:start position:0%
but there is no for people of 18 i
believe

02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
and there is no equivalent state law
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
for those
 
02:39:52.230 --> 02:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
cases but in talking to police and
 
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
chiefs and whatever
 
02:39:56.950 --> 02:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
somehow they are able through public
 
02:39:59.110 --> 02:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
safety lawyers or somewhere to be able
 
02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:00.230 align:start position:0%
safety lawyers or somewhere to be able
to

02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
get somebody to remove themselves from
 
02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
the school or they have to come up with
 
02:40:05.670 --> 02:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
some other way to get someone that is
 
02:40:07.590 --> 02:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
carrying an arm in a school
 
02:40:09.429 --> 02:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
so am i just totally confused it can't
 
02:40:09.439 --> 02:40:10.309 align:start position:0%
so am i just totally confused it can't
be

02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
you can't figure it out what's your
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
opinion of
 
02:40:16.389 --> 02:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
how this law relates to that kind of
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
conflict that i
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
see well yeah i i mean i guess
 
02:40:25.030 --> 02:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
i think as a general matter in other
 
02:40:26.469 --> 02:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
words if you're if you're saying for
 
02:40:26.479 --> 02:40:27.510 align:start position:0%
words if you're if you're saying for
example

02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:40:31.269 --> 02:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
if there was a if the
 
02:40:32.950 --> 02:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
if the federal government were
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
investigating an alleged violation of
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
the gun free the federal country school
 
02:40:38.870 --> 02:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
zones act
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
could this you know if this were passed
 
02:40:49.269 --> 02:40:49.279 align:start position:0%
could the state cooperate in that
 
02:40:51.190 --> 02:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
i think it would really depend on the
 
02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
facts of the case because for example it
 
02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:55.510 align:start position:0%
facts of the case because for example it
might

02:40:55.510 --> 02:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
might
 
02:40:56.309 --> 02:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:40:57.830 --> 02:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
it might often be the case that there
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
would be some basis for the state to be
 
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about you know is there is
 
02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
there some threat of a violation of
 
02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
state laws an assault shooting whatever
 
02:41:10.870 --> 02:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
that would that would you know authorize
 
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
the state to be
 
02:41:19.110 --> 02:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
i think that's close to what i was
 
02:41:22.870 --> 02:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
trying to say it's you do have a federal
 
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
gun free school zone
 
02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
if someone
 
02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
and we don't have an equivalent state
 
02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:31.510 align:start position:0%
and we don't have an equivalent state
law

02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
right now the way the situation is now
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
without without this law
 
02:41:39.030 --> 02:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
and someone shows up at the school armed
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
with the ar-15 and they call the police
 
02:41:43.990 --> 02:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
and the police just want to get the
 
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
person to leave
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
is there any state law that they can
 
02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
rely on for them to do that or do you
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
actually have to wait for atf to come or
 
02:41:55.990 --> 02:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
can they talk the guy off the property
 
02:41:59.269 --> 02:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
or what's the situation in that
 
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
hypothetical situation
 
02:42:05.269 --> 02:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
i guess i i would assume if someone
 
02:42:08.309 --> 02:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
showed up at at a school with an ar-15
 
02:42:09.670 --> 02:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
and they were you know
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
i guess you have to talk about the
 
02:42:14.630 --> 02:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
you have to talk about the situation i
 
02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:15.830 align:start position:0%
you have to talk about the situation i
mean

02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
you know there as as i understand the
 
02:42:19.030 --> 02:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
federal gun free school zones act there
 
02:42:20.950 --> 02:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
are very there are various
 
02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions to the
 
02:42:24.630 --> 02:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
you know to when it applies and i mean
 
02:42:26.389 --> 02:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
i'll just give you an example
 
02:42:30.230 --> 02:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
i'm a target shooter i often have a a
 
02:42:32.950 --> 02:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
rifle in the in the back of my car and
 
02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
when my kids were younger and were going
 
02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
to school i often dropped them off at
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
school with a gun in the back it was
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
obviously it was in a case it was locked
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
it was unloaded you know i wasn't
 
02:42:45.590 --> 02:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
planning to to take it out but i so i
 
02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
guess if
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
if that was the situation there would be
 
02:42:51.910 --> 02:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
no basis to believe that there was a
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
violation of state law or federal law
 
02:42:57.590 --> 02:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
but if somebody you know
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
we're we're walking into the we're
 
02:43:02.389 --> 02:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
we're walking into a high school with a
 
02:43:04.630 --> 02:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
loaded ar-15 or any other gun for that
 
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
matter i think the police might have
 
02:43:09.510 --> 02:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
would certainly have a basis to to at
 
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
least find out what was going on
 
02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
and said to you know and so to that
 
02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
extent to cooperate if you will
 
02:43:19.429 --> 02:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:21.510 --> 02:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:43:24.230 --> 02:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
were you looking back in your notes to a
 
02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
previous bill
 
02:43:31.590 --> 02:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
sb senate bill 154 from last year in
 
02:43:37.349 --> 02:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
fact i remember i believe i had some
 
02:43:39.269 --> 02:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
discussion with representative
 
02:43:39.279 --> 02:43:40.309 align:start position:0%
discussion with representative
uh

02:43:40.309 --> 02:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:43:42.309 --> 02:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative burt about this
 
02:43:44.389 --> 02:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh because he had some concern about the
 
02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
section two at the time
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
um and and we we sort of had some back
 
02:43:50.710 --> 02:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
and forth i sent him a proposal about
 
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:43:53.269 --> 02:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
trying to address some of his concerns i
 
02:43:53.279 --> 02:43:54.230 align:start position:0%
trying to address some of his concerns i
i

02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't really talk to him after that
 
02:43:57.670 --> 02:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i assume it didn't address his
 
02:43:58.950 --> 02:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
concerns but
 
02:43:58.960 --> 02:44:00.150 align:start position:0%
concerns but
um

02:44:00.150 --> 02:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:02.309 --> 02:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
i was trying to address
 
02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
some of his concerns
 
02:44:09.750 --> 02:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:11.359 align:start position:0%

of which illustrated by representative
lin

02:44:42.710 --> 02:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
lin
 
02:44:45.030 --> 02:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
that is currently drafted the bill could
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
negatively impact law enforcement
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
activities and pose legal challenges in
 
02:44:50.550 --> 02:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
as introduced the bill prohibits state
 
02:44:55.429 --> 02:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
and local resources to enforce
 
02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
administer or cooperate with
 
02:45:01.429 --> 02:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
federal gun laws and regulations that
 
02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
are inconsistent or unaddressed by state
 
02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:04.630 align:start position:0%
are inconsistent or unaddressed by state
law

02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:45:07.349 --> 02:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
focusing on the word cooperate
 
02:45:09.349 --> 02:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
this runs a great risk of hindering
 
02:45:11.429 --> 02:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
criminal investigations for a few
 
02:45:11.439 --> 02:45:12.830 align:start position:0%
criminal investigations for a few
reasons

02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
02:45:16.150 --> 02:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
first other statutes authorize state
 
02:45:18.550 --> 02:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
police to share information with the
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
federal government to prevent and detect
 
02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:21.990 align:start position:0%
federal government to prevent and detect
crime

02:45:21.990 --> 02:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
crime
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
this is a critical partnership and keeps
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
the state safe
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
but the language as drafted would place
 
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
a cloud on this relationship because the
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
challenges it challenges whether state
 
02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:34.870 align:start position:0%
challenges it challenges whether state
police

02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
could share this data
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
as it could be used by the federal
 
02:45:42.950 --> 02:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
government to enforce federal gun law
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
the second example here would be
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
state and local law enforcement
 
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
routinely cooperate with the dea
 
02:45:55.110 --> 02:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
fbi and other federal agencies to
 
02:45:57.590 --> 02:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
conduct drug interdiction operations and
 
02:45:59.670 --> 02:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
combat drug trafficking
 
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
many drug-related arrests involve the
 
02:46:04.309 --> 02:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
seizure and forfeiture of illegal
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
firearms under federal law
 
02:46:08.950 --> 02:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
or the arrest of those disqualified to
 
02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
possess a firearm under federal law
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
as drafted the bill calls into doubt the
 
02:46:16.309 --> 02:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
ability of state of the state to
 
02:46:18.550 --> 02:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
participate in such joint adventure or
 
02:46:20.790 --> 02:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
joint endeavors
 
02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:22.150 align:start position:0%
joint endeavors
additionally

02:46:22.150 --> 02:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
02:46:24.389 --> 02:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
two other kind of sets of concerns here
 
02:46:26.550 --> 02:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
as introduced the bill may harm the
 
02:46:28.630 --> 02:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
state's ability to receive grant funding
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
 
02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
current grants with the u.s department
 
02:46:33.590 --> 02:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
of justice require law enforcement to
 
02:46:35.830 --> 02:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
submit information to the national
 
02:46:39.269 --> 02:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
instant criminal background check system
 
02:46:41.429 --> 02:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
pertaining to convictions that are
 
02:46:43.110 --> 02:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
federal disqualifiers for purchasing
 
02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:44.630 align:start position:0%
federal disqualifiers for purchasing
firearms

02:46:44.630 --> 02:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
firearms
 
02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
as drafted the bill would limit the
 
02:46:49.269 --> 02:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
state and local government's abilities
 
02:46:51.349 --> 02:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
to qualify for key federal funding or
 
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
could limit those abilities
 
02:46:55.429 --> 02:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
last the bill has drafted raises
 
02:46:58.150 --> 02:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional questions such as whether
 
02:46:59.990 --> 02:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
can dictate how the executive branch
 
02:47:03.910 --> 02:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
investigates criminal offenses and there
 
02:47:05.990 --> 02:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
also may be preemption issues of federal
 
02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:07.510 align:start position:0%
also may be preemption issues of federal
law

02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:47:09.349 --> 02:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
the department of justice is willing to
 
02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
work with a work committee uh to address
 
02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
some of these concerns and see if we can
 
02:47:15.670 --> 02:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
craft a bill see if a bill can come out
 
02:47:18.070 --> 02:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
of that effort to that would satisfy all
 
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
the parties involved or all the
 
02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
interests but
 
02:47:22.870 --> 02:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
for now i'm happy to take questions from
 
02:47:26.710 --> 02:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.990 --> 02:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative roy you should be
 
02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
if the chairman may inquire with the
 
02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
question can you explain what the
 
02:47:36.630 --> 02:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
concern is about preemption
 
02:47:39.030 --> 02:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
simply that they're with the
 
02:47:40.150 --> 02:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:45.269 --> 02:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
it would be supreme they can't the
 
02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
federal government can't order state
 
02:47:48.790 --> 02:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
actors to engage in kind of federal law
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement efforts but there may be
 
02:47:52.790 --> 02:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
questions of whether or not in engaging
 
02:47:54.790 --> 02:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
in a particular activity
 
02:47:57.349 --> 02:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
in one of these joint endeavors
 
02:47:58.469 --> 02:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
can we kind of tell the federal
 
02:48:00.309 --> 02:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
government no you can't enforce the law
 
02:48:01.349 --> 02:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
in this circumstance because we're
 
02:48:03.349 --> 02:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
working together we are limited in only
 
02:48:04.950 --> 02:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
enforcing state law in these
 
02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances that would be i think the
 
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
kind of main example of preemption it's
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
not as significant a concern
 
02:48:13.269 --> 02:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
but it was one that we flagged as a
 
02:48:17.910 --> 02:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:19.670 --> 02:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
02:48:21.190 --> 02:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:22.309 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you for taking my
question

02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:48:24.070 --> 02:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
is it not the case that
 
02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
occasionally during joint investigations
 
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
that sometimes state law enforcement
 
02:48:31.830 --> 02:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
officials are sworn in as temporary
 
02:48:33.910 --> 02:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
agents of the federal government
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
that does happen in certain
 
02:48:39.429 --> 02:48:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:41.510 --> 02:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative testament
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:48:43.439 --> 02:48:45.030 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

02:48:45.030 --> 02:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
monies that you received from
 
02:48:50.950 --> 02:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
grants you received from the federal
 
02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:52.309 align:start position:0%
grants you received from the federal
government

02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:48:55.510 --> 02:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
what percentage of your overall budget
 
02:48:56.710 --> 02:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:48:59.670 --> 02:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
kind of grand money makeup
 
02:49:01.269 --> 02:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
i don't have those exact numbers
 
02:49:02.630 --> 02:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
available to me but that's something we
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
could i could have our administrator
 
02:49:05.590 --> 02:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
look into and
 
02:49:07.110 --> 02:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
provide additional detail but i don't
 
02:49:08.230 --> 02:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
know that on the top of my head i'm
 
02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:12.309 align:start position:0%
know that on the top of my head i'm
sorry

02:49:12.309 --> 02:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:12.319 --> 02:49:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
conley

02:49:13.670 --> 02:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
conley
 
02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:49:16.309 --> 02:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
taking the question what would be the
 
02:49:16.319 --> 02:49:17.349 align:start position:0%
taking the question what would be the
effect

02:49:17.349 --> 02:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
effect
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
on law enforcement in the state if
 
02:49:21.510 --> 02:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
federal grants that we currently receive
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
would be uh
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
eliminated or rescinded if this were to
 
02:49:27.030 --> 02:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
pass again
 
02:49:28.389 --> 02:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
you know similar to representative
 
02:49:29.750 --> 02:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
testerman's question i can't speak to
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
every law enforcement agency and how
 
02:49:33.269 --> 02:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
much federal funding funding they
 
02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
receive but you know the concern is
 
02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
definitely a significant one on our part
 
02:49:39.030 --> 02:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
because we also sub grant funding to
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
state our local law enforcement agencies
 
02:49:42.550 --> 02:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
as well in terms of the funds that we
 
02:49:44.790 --> 02:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
receive to assist in whether it's drug
 
02:49:46.230 --> 02:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
interdiction efforts or other efforts
 
02:49:48.150 --> 02:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
that the department undertakes with the
 
02:49:50.870 --> 02:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
assistance of local agencies
 
02:49:52.870 --> 02:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative conley thank you so if
 
02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing you right this would hinder
 
02:49:55.990 --> 02:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in our state if this
 
02:49:57.429 --> 02:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
were to pass in the grant funding where
 
02:49:58.870 --> 02:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
we're sending
 
02:50:00.550 --> 02:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
it creates that potential because again
 
02:50:02.230 --> 02:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
there's that question about what does
 
02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
02:50:10.150 --> 02:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:50:12.070 --> 02:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
i know you've expressed uh hesitancy
 
02:50:15.910 --> 02:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
about just saying we can't cooperate
 
02:50:17.590 --> 02:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
with the federal government
 
02:50:19.190 --> 02:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
but isn't this
 
02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
pretty particular that we can't
 
02:50:24.389 --> 02:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
it's only talking about like second
 
02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
amendment issues firearms
 
02:50:29.269 --> 02:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
is not talking about
 
02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
correct

02:50:33.510 --> 02:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:50:35.429 --> 02:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
the concern arises though that in this
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
context of that cooperation federal
 
02:50:39.990 --> 02:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
government may be enforced as well and
 
02:50:41.750 --> 02:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
so kind of the example being that often
 
02:50:43.269 --> 02:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
times in these drug investigations there
 
02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
are firearms involved and so
 
02:50:48.309 --> 02:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
if the person arrested has not committed
 
02:50:50.070 --> 02:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
a violation of state law but only
 
02:50:52.790 --> 02:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
federal law in possessing those firearms
 
02:50:54.790 --> 02:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
is that cooperation with the federal
 
02:50:56.309 --> 02:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
government to enforce federal government
 
02:50:57.990 --> 02:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the cloud that exists
 
02:50:59.590 --> 02:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
here in the concern that really
 
02:51:01.830 --> 02:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
underlies a lot of uh the department's
 
02:51:07.990 --> 02:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
if the chairman inquired with the
 
02:51:11.110 --> 02:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
question can you
 
02:51:13.429 --> 02:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
provide any any instances where other
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
states passed a similar policy where
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
they were denied any funding or grant
 
02:51:20.070 --> 02:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
grant money through the federal
 
02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:21.110 align:start position:0%
grant money through the federal
government

02:51:21.110 --> 02:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:51:22.870 --> 02:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
that is something we have to look into i
 
02:51:24.550 --> 02:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't have that answer kind of readily
 
02:51:26.230 --> 02:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
available i'm not aware of
 
02:51:27.590 --> 02:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
kind of the impact other states have
 
02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
faced in these circumstances
 
02:51:31.190 --> 02:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
if they and even if states have passed
 
02:51:34.469 --> 02:51:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:37.990 --> 02:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
the committee calls alan rice gun owners
 
02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:03.429 --> 02:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
02:52:05.590 --> 02:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is alan

02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:08.790 align:start position:0%
rice i'm a resident of bedford new
hampshire

02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm here representing gun owners of
 
02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:11.830 align:start position:0%
and i'm here representing gun owners of
america

02:52:11.830 --> 02:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
america
 
02:52:17.349 --> 02:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:19.750 --> 02:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
i wanted to address
 
02:52:22.230 --> 02:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
some of what representative lynn
 
02:52:23.750 --> 02:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
spoke about
 
02:52:25.110 --> 02:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
he said that
 
02:52:27.190 --> 02:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
there's no teeth to it it's our
 
02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:29.030 align:start position:0%
there's no teeth to it it's our
expectation

02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
expectation
 
02:52:31.030 --> 02:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law enforcement has a
 
02:52:33.030 --> 02:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
reputation of high integrity more so
 
02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
than other states
 
02:52:36.389 --> 02:52:36.399 align:start position:0%
um should this be enacted into law it's
 
02:52:37.990 --> 02:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
our expectation that they would follow
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
the law
 
02:52:40.710 --> 02:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need draconian
 
02:52:42.550 --> 02:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
penalties to force new hampshire law
 
02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement to follow the law because
 
02:52:47.830 --> 02:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple concept in house bill
 
02:52:53.349 --> 02:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
1178 state and local police are hired
 
02:52:55.750 --> 02:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
trained and compensated with state and
 
02:52:57.670 --> 02:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
local tax dollars
 
02:52:59.910 --> 02:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
federal agents are hired trained and
 
02:53:02.870 --> 02:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
compensated with federal tax dollars
 
02:53:05.110 --> 02:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be employing
 
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
state and local police to enforce
 
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
federal laws
 
02:53:10.710 --> 02:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
we have federal agents for that
 
02:53:10.720 --> 02:53:11.670 align:start position:0%
we have federal agents for that
um

02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:13.590 --> 02:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that comes to mind
 
02:53:15.190 --> 02:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
quite often
 
02:53:16.870 --> 02:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
with there's a lot of federal government
 
02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
overreach is in the regulation of gun
 
02:53:18.479 --> 02:53:19.830 align:start position:0%
overreach is in the regulation of gun
dealers

02:53:19.830 --> 02:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
dealers
 
02:53:21.910 --> 02:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
do we really want
 
02:53:23.910 --> 02:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
state and local police going into gun
 
02:53:27.349 --> 02:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
dealers to do records checks inspections
 
02:53:29.429 --> 02:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
verify that the inventory in the dealer
 
02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
records is actually physically in the
 
02:53:31.600 --> 02:53:33.190 align:start position:0%
records is actually physically in the
building

02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
building
 
02:53:35.750 --> 02:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's a job for the batf that's not a
 
02:53:39.269 --> 02:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
job for state and local law enforcement
 
02:53:42.389 --> 02:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
when a firearm is stolen from a dealer
 
02:53:44.710 --> 02:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
there are federal penalties
 
02:53:46.950 --> 02:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
but it's burglary or theft depending on
 
02:53:48.469 --> 02:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
the nature of the crime there's also
 
02:53:50.389 --> 02:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
state penalties so there'd be state laws
 
02:53:50.399 --> 02:53:52.230 align:start position:0%
state penalties so there'd be state laws
enforced

02:53:52.230 --> 02:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
should the federal government you know
 
02:53:55.830 --> 02:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
decide they want to aggressively enforce
 
02:53:58.389 --> 02:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
the federal gun free school zones act
 
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
and that was mentioned earlier but there
 
02:54:02.550 --> 02:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
are exemptions and the most common
 
02:54:04.830 --> 02:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
exemption is if the person carrying the
 
02:54:07.750 --> 02:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
firearm has a perimeter license issued
 
02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
by the state in which the school is
 
02:54:11.429 --> 02:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
located in they can carry a gun new
 
02:54:14.309 --> 02:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire does not prohibit adults key
 
02:54:15.750 --> 02:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
word is adults
 
02:54:17.670 --> 02:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
from carrying a gun in a school and i
 
02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
believe if my memory serves me it was
 
02:54:21.750 --> 02:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general joe foster or former
 
02:54:24.230 --> 02:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
attorney general joe foster who had
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
issued opinions saying hey
 
02:54:28.550 --> 02:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
state and local police can't enforce
 
02:54:30.870 --> 02:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
this it's not a state law
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
and his opinions are more consistent
 
02:54:35.670 --> 02:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
with you know supreme court cases
 
02:54:39.269 --> 02:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
um the one on point is
 
02:54:41.429 --> 02:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
prince versus united states from back in
 
02:54:42.950 --> 02:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
the 90s when
 
02:54:44.950 --> 02:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
the court ruled the federal government
 
02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
can't compel states to do their work
 
02:54:49.190 --> 02:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
that was a firearms case
 
02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
i mentioned some other cases in my
 
02:54:53.030 --> 02:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
letter that are not firearms but in
 
02:54:54.389 --> 02:54:54.399 align:start position:0%
similar vein
 
02:54:56.469 --> 02:54:56.479 align:start position:0%
the federal government cannot compel the
 
02:54:57.910 --> 02:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
states to do their work well if they
 
02:55:00.309 --> 02:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
can't compel the states to do their work
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
the state shouldn't voluntarily do their
 
02:55:02.399 --> 02:55:03.590 align:start position:0%
the state shouldn't voluntarily do their
work

02:55:03.590 --> 02:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire likes to say we're a
 
02:55:07.269 --> 02:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
fiscally conservative state
 
02:55:08.790 --> 02:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
this is part of being fiscally
 
02:55:10.230 --> 02:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
conservative it's not doing someone
 
02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
else's job for them so based on all of
 
02:55:15.269 --> 02:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
that and the information i supplied you
 
02:55:16.710 --> 02:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
in my letter which i did email the
 
02:55:18.790 --> 02:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
committee last night i would ask that
 
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
you vote house bill 1178 ought to pass
 
02:55:24.550 --> 02:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
without any amendments or changes and i
 
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:35.830 --> 02:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
02:55:37.349 --> 02:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
question this believe it or not is in
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
good faith can you did i hear you say
 
02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:40.550 align:start position:0%
good faith can you did i hear you say
that

02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:42.070 align:start position:0%
that
current

02:55:42.070 --> 02:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:43.269 align:start position:0%
current
uh

02:55:43.269 --> 02:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:55:45.269 --> 02:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
pr legal you know the current situation
 
02:55:47.110 --> 02:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is that state
 
02:55:49.830 --> 02:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
officers do not enforce federal law um
 
02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
is there any situation
 
02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:53.349 align:start position:0%
is there any situation
currently

02:55:53.349 --> 02:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:55:55.750 --> 02:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
where that would overlap uh or is it
 
02:55:57.429 --> 02:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
just that's the standard that's the norm
 
02:55:59.510 --> 02:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't happen i'm referring to a
 
02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:00.870 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't happen i'm referring to a
letter

02:56:00.870 --> 02:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
letter
 
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
that former attorney general joe foster
 
02:56:04.950 --> 02:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
issued i don't remember what year it was
 
02:56:06.630 --> 02:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
but he's been out of office now for like
 
02:56:08.950 --> 02:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
five years so it was back a ways
 
02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
and his specific letter was
 
02:56:12.870 --> 02:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to the federal gun free
 
02:56:14.309 --> 02:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
school zones act
 
02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
and that that is a federal law
 
02:56:19.429 --> 02:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
and if an adult i want to emphasize
 
02:56:21.910 --> 02:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
adult so someone like you or i is
 
02:56:24.630 --> 02:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
observed carrying a firearm in school
 
02:56:26.710 --> 02:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
that's not a state crime and even though
 
02:56:29.030 --> 02:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's a federal law with specific
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
exemptions state and local police should
 
02:56:36.389 --> 02:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:37.190 --> 02:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative connolly you're
 
02:56:39.269 --> 02:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
recognizing where i'm going with that is
 
02:56:41.429 --> 02:56:41.439 align:start position:0%
if that's the norm is this law needed
 
02:56:43.030 --> 02:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
because if that's already the standard
 
02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
in our state would it not would that
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
practice and standard not continue
 
02:56:48.950 --> 02:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
well representative i appreciate that
 
02:56:51.830 --> 02:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
question um it's always good to codify
 
02:56:55.670 --> 02:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
things in law that attorney generals say
 
02:56:57.030 --> 02:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
former attorney general foster's been
 
02:56:58.710 --> 02:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
out of office now for quite a while some
 
02:57:01.510 --> 02:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
other attorney general could come in and
 
02:57:03.269 --> 02:57:03.279 align:start position:0%
read our constitution in our laws and
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
issue a completely different opinion but
 
02:57:07.030 --> 02:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
if the legislature codifies it in
 
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
statute well then it's black and white
 
02:57:14.630 --> 02:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:18.870 --> 02:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:21.030 --> 02:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
02:57:22.710 --> 02:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you speak up
 
02:57:24.469 --> 02:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
please sir
 
02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:28.710 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

02:57:28.710 --> 02:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
do you see any contradiction in this law
 
02:57:34.389 --> 02:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
which is one that we're trying to pass
 
02:57:36.469 --> 02:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
that would say
 
02:57:36.479 --> 02:57:37.190 align:start position:0%
that would say
that

02:57:37.190 --> 02:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:57:39.750 --> 02:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
local police cannot and should not
 
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
enforce federal law
 
02:57:43.830 --> 02:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
and another one we heard previously that
 
02:57:45.910 --> 02:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
said that state police and local police
 
02:57:47.990 --> 02:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
cannot and should not do anything to
 
02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.230 align:start position:0%
cannot and should not do anything to
discourage

02:57:50.230 --> 02:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
discourage
 
02:57:52.469 --> 02:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
local police from enforcing laws like
 
02:57:54.630 --> 02:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
immigration laws so i see a conflict
 
02:57:56.389 --> 02:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
between the
 
02:57:58.790 --> 02:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
position between in those two bills
 
02:58:00.389 --> 02:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
represent comment about that
 
02:58:01.830 --> 02:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative newman was there a
 
02:58:03.429 --> 02:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
question there
 
02:58:06.389 --> 02:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
yes my question was does the witness see
 
02:58:10.309 --> 02:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
any contradiction in the fact in
 
02:58:13.750 --> 02:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
enforcing of gun law and not enforcing
 
02:58:15.349 --> 02:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
an immigration law we have two bills in
 
02:58:18.309 --> 02:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
front of the house to do that right now
 
02:58:18.319 --> 02:58:19.269 align:start position:0%
front of the house to do that right now
well

02:58:19.269 --> 02:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:58:21.670 --> 02:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear the testimony on the other
 
02:58:23.910 --> 02:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
bill i stepped out in hallway to return
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
some emails because it wasn't a firearms
 
02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:27.110 align:start position:0%
some emails because it wasn't a firearms
bill

02:58:27.110 --> 02:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:58:28.870 --> 02:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
gun owners of america is a second
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
amendment advocacy organization we are
 
02:58:34.230 --> 02:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
singularly focused on second amendment
 
02:58:34.240 --> 02:58:35.349 align:start position:0%
singularly focused on second amendment
rights

02:58:35.349 --> 02:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:58:38.550 --> 02:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
having said that my personal opinion as
 
02:58:40.469 --> 02:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
a resident of new hampshire as a
 
02:58:42.710 --> 02:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in the state of new hampshire
 
02:58:44.550 --> 02:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
is that state and local law enforcement
 
02:58:46.950 --> 02:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
should be enforcing state and local laws
 
02:58:48.630 --> 02:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
and federal law enforcement should be
 
02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
enforcing federal laws
 
02:58:53.110 --> 02:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and i
 
02:58:54.550 --> 02:58:54.560 align:start position:0%

02:59:02.309 --> 02:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the witness
 
02:59:04.870 --> 02:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
is excused
 
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
committee now calls john marasco new
 
02:59:13.510 --> 02:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:15.190 --> 02:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone uh thank you for
 
02:59:17.349 --> 02:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
your service my name is john marasco i'm
 
02:59:19.030 --> 02:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
a major with new hampshire state police
 
02:59:20.469 --> 02:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
and i oversee two out of the three
 
02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
bureaus one of which is the
 
02:59:24.150 --> 02:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
investigative services bureau
 
02:59:25.670 --> 02:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
the other is the justice information
 
02:59:28.230 --> 02:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
bureau which encompasses the gun line
 
02:59:30.389 --> 02:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
the investigative services bureau is
 
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for the major crime unit the
 
02:59:34.309 --> 02:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
narcotics investigations unit the
 
02:59:36.150 --> 02:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
special investigations unit and the
 
02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
information and analysis center
 
02:59:40.230 --> 02:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
i just uh listening to a.g locke's
 
02:59:42.230 --> 02:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
testimony i just wanted to compliment
 
02:59:42.240 --> 02:59:43.590 align:start position:0%
testimony i just wanted to compliment
that

02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:59:45.910 --> 02:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know certainly the number of crimes
 
02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
that are committed across state lines we
 
02:59:50.230 --> 02:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
work very closely with our federal
 
02:59:52.230 --> 02:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
partners in fact we have task force
 
02:59:54.870 --> 02:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
officers that are assigned to the dea to
 
02:59:57.030 --> 02:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
the fbi to the u.s postal inspection
 
02:59:58.550 --> 02:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
service and
 
02:59:59.830 --> 02:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
those responsibilities are really
 
03:00:02.309 --> 03:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
focused on drug crime for the most part
 
03:00:02.319 --> 03:00:03.269 align:start position:0%
focused on drug crime for the most part
and

03:00:03.269 --> 03:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:00:05.910 --> 03:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's common obviously as you all know
 
03:00:08.309 --> 03:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
when you have a drug offense there
 
03:00:11.110 --> 03:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
oftentimes is a weapon involved so atf
 
03:00:12.550 --> 03:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
is involved in a lot of these cases
 
03:00:12.560 --> 03:00:13.670 align:start position:0%
is involved in a lot of these cases
sometimes

03:00:13.670 --> 03:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
03:00:15.750 --> 03:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
the federal agency might be the lead on
 
03:00:17.349 --> 03:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
a drug investigation that takes place
 
03:00:19.110 --> 03:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire and state and
 
03:00:21.349 --> 03:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
local police support them in the drug
 
03:00:23.510 --> 03:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
investigation but as that investigation
 
03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:25.429 align:start position:0%
investigation but as that investigation
continues

03:00:25.429 --> 03:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
continues
 
03:00:27.110 --> 03:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
you may seize a firearm and there is
 
03:00:29.590 --> 03:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
going to be potentially federal firearms
 
03:00:29.600 --> 03:00:30.790 align:start position:0%
going to be potentially federal firearms
charges

03:00:30.790 --> 03:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
charges
 
03:00:32.550 --> 03:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
that are brought forth in some cases
 
03:00:34.230 --> 03:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
they might be brought forth at the state
 
03:00:36.389 --> 03:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
level depending on the crime so
 
03:00:38.070 --> 03:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
that collaboration and that partnership
 
03:00:40.870 --> 03:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
that we have with our our federal uh
 
03:00:43.510 --> 03:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
agencies is vital to um to what we do
 
03:00:45.750 --> 03:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
here and as far as grants go
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
certainly those grants
 
03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars
 
03:00:51.429 --> 03:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes into the millions of dollars
 
03:00:54.150 --> 03:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
focused on um you know the opioid
 
03:00:56.389 --> 03:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
situation and drug crimes across the
 
03:00:58.469 --> 03:00:58.479 align:start position:0%
board and and part of that
 
03:00:59.990 --> 03:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
grant application is going to be focused
 
03:01:02.309 --> 03:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
on collaboration and partnership
 
03:01:04.870 --> 03:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
so that's that is very real the only
 
03:01:07.269 --> 03:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
other thing i did want to say is on the
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
active shooter scenario
 
03:01:12.550 --> 03:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
escape safe school zones that aside if
 
03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's an active shooter taking place
 
03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the state i can tell you
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
from the state police standpoint when we
 
03:01:19.510 --> 03:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
arrive there we're going to go in and
 
03:01:21.190 --> 03:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
identify and mitigate that threat as
 
03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible to save lives so we
 
03:01:25.349 --> 03:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
would deal with the uh the federal
 
03:01:27.349 --> 03:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
limitations after the fact but if
 
03:01:28.870 --> 03:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
children are being injured or killed
 
03:01:31.590 --> 03:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
we're going in there
 
03:01:34.790 --> 03:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
03:01:38.389 --> 03:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:39.830 --> 03:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
03:01:41.830 --> 03:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's similar to the one i asked just
 
03:01:45.429 --> 03:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
previously would the state police
 
03:01:47.510 --> 03:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
find difficulty if they had several
 
03:01:49.670 --> 03:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
lawyers some that said cooperate with
 
03:01:51.910 --> 03:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
some federal laws and others that said
 
03:01:53.510 --> 03:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't cooperate with others how would
 
03:01:55.750 --> 03:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
that affect the state police
 
03:01:58.309 --> 03:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
so i heard your question originally sir
 
03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
we do have a
 
03:02:01.830 --> 03:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
fair and impartial policing policy that
 
03:02:04.309 --> 03:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
was put in place
 
03:02:07.429 --> 03:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
at least two if not three years ago now
 
03:02:10.150 --> 03:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
and that policy delineates those
 
03:02:13.269 --> 03:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of ice versus the new
 
03:02:14.469 --> 03:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police or law
 
03:02:16.870 --> 03:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies many have adopted
 
03:02:18.150 --> 03:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
that policy
 
03:02:20.230 --> 03:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
so there are some parameters that were
 
03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
set forth there based on uh on federal
 
03:02:24.389 --> 03:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
law and um
 
03:02:26.710 --> 03:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
state considerations as well as far as
 
03:02:28.790 --> 03:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here
 
03:02:31.590 --> 03:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
with regards to you know gun and guns
 
03:02:32.950 --> 03:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
and crimes
 
03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
there is that overlap with uh you know
 
03:02:37.110 --> 03:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
with what we deal with in the drug world
 
03:02:38.790 --> 03:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
in particular not to say major crime
 
03:02:40.309 --> 03:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
isn't another issue
 
03:02:42.630 --> 03:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
certainly when we have a homicide case
 
03:02:44.230 --> 03:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
many times our federal authorities will
 
03:02:46.070 --> 03:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
come in and assist us with that if a gun
 
03:02:48.309 --> 03:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
was used to try to track the gun down in
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
other cases they may call us and ask us
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
for their our assistance in in some
 
03:02:54.469 --> 03:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
capacity but
 
03:02:56.469 --> 03:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
there is a policy on that one this one
 
03:02:56.479 --> 03:02:58.150 align:start position:0%
there is a policy on that one this one
here

03:02:58.150 --> 03:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:02:59.830 --> 03:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
guns happen to be involved in drug
 
03:03:01.510 --> 03:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
crimes frequently and so we work
 
03:03:03.190 --> 03:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
together on those there is no policy on
 
03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:04.389 align:start position:0%
together on those there is no policy on
that

03:03:04.389 --> 03:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:03:06.710 --> 03:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:03:08.790 --> 03:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
03:03:09.990 --> 03:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:03:12.399 --> 03:03:13.190 align:start position:0%
taking my question
a

03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:03:15.510 --> 03:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
specific scenario
 
03:03:18.150 --> 03:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
the president united states
 
03:03:20.469 --> 03:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
issues an executive order that says
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
assault weapons are hereby banned
 
03:03:24.309 --> 03:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:03:26.389 --> 03:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
would be designed to stop that how would
 
03:03:28.230 --> 03:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
that impact
 
03:03:29.910 --> 03:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
or or would you be able to work within
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:38.550 --> 03:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
so assault weapons are banned meaning so
 
03:03:39.990 --> 03:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking more are we talking about
 
03:03:42.389 --> 03:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
the sale or we're talking about the
 
03:03:42.399 --> 03:03:44.469 align:start position:0%
the sale or we're talking about the
possession

03:03:44.469 --> 03:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
possession
 
03:03:47.349 --> 03:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
either or by an executive order that was
 
03:03:49.110 --> 03:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
not in comporting with new hampshire
 
03:03:51.670 --> 03:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
03:03:53.349 --> 03:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
i'd have to i'd have to conduct some
 
03:03:55.670 --> 03:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
research on that i'm not not sure how
 
03:03:57.269 --> 03:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
that would apply but actually i have to
 
03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
rely on uh hulk for more insight on that
 
03:04:06.389 --> 03:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
if the chair may inquire with a question
 
03:04:09.429 --> 03:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
and thank you in advance for taking my
 
03:04:09.439 --> 03:04:12.070 align:start position:0%
and thank you in advance for taking my
question

03:04:12.070 --> 03:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:13.349 --> 03:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
what are the circumstances that would
 
03:04:15.670 --> 03:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
occur let's say if the dea were to
 
03:04:17.750 --> 03:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
contact the state police or even
 
03:04:19.190 --> 03:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps local law enforcement and
 
03:04:21.670 --> 03:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
request assistance with
 
03:04:24.070 --> 03:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps executing a raid on a medical
 
03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis facility which is still illegal
 
03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
under federal law
 
03:04:30.630 --> 03:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
is there a policy right now that the new
 
03:04:32.790 --> 03:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police would
 
03:04:34.230 --> 03:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
have to adhere to
 
03:04:38.070 --> 03:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:39.670 --> 03:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
and if i may ask with a follow-up is
 
03:04:41.110 --> 03:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
there any policy preventing the new
 
03:04:42.790 --> 03:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police from
 
03:04:45.429 --> 03:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
participating with the dea in executing
 
03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
that raid
 
03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
there is no policy that would prevent us
 
03:04:50.870 --> 03:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
from doing that
 
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
however that's something that certainly
 
03:04:54.790 --> 03:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
would fall under the federal purview and
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
at that point really they would they
 
03:04:58.389 --> 03:04:58.399 align:start position:0%
would be the lead like i said before
 
03:04:59.750 --> 03:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
there are many cases where the federal
 
03:05:01.269 --> 03:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
government is the lead on an
 
03:05:01.279 --> 03:05:02.710 align:start position:0%
government is the lead on an
investigation

03:05:02.710 --> 03:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
03:05:04.389 --> 03:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
and they might ask us for
 
03:05:05.830 --> 03:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
tactical support
 
03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
they might ask us for the perimeter to
 
03:05:09.590 --> 03:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that the public is safe and
 
03:05:09.600 --> 03:05:10.550 align:start position:0%
make sure that the public is safe and
nobody

03:05:10.550 --> 03:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
03:05:12.790 --> 03:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
goes near the the residents or whatever
 
03:05:14.389 --> 03:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
dwelling they might be addressing and we
 
03:05:16.469 --> 03:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
do deal with that all the time
 
03:05:17.910 --> 03:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know where the federal government
 
03:05:20.469 --> 03:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
has an arrest warrant for an individual
 
03:05:22.710 --> 03:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
they ask for assistance from state or
 
03:05:24.550 --> 03:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement uh but i can tell
 
03:05:25.990 --> 03:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
you you know only from a state police
 
03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint that if it's their warrant
 
03:05:31.990 --> 03:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
they typically will execute the warrant
 
03:05:33.510 --> 03:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we will provide some layer of
 
03:05:33.520 --> 03:05:34.710 align:start position:0%
and we will provide some layer of
support

03:05:34.710 --> 03:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:05:36.389 --> 03:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking
 
03:05:37.750 --> 03:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
it might be after the fact that the
 
03:05:39.030 --> 03:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
search if there's a search warrant as
 
03:05:39.040 --> 03:05:39.990 align:start position:0%
search if there's a search warrant as
well

03:05:39.990 --> 03:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
if they request our tactical team then
 
03:05:43.349 --> 03:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
certainly there will be conversations
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
about how we can assist there so we do
 
03:05:47.269 --> 03:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
the best we can to support our federal
 
03:05:49.110 --> 03:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
partners but when it comes to a legal
 
03:05:50.630 --> 03:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
question like that
 
03:05:52.710 --> 03:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
if it's a federal crime typically it's
 
03:05:54.309 --> 03:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
going to be a federal warrant and a
 
03:05:57.510 --> 03:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
federal execution in most cases
 
03:05:59.429 --> 03:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
but if they again if they need
 
03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
assistance on the tactical front um or
 
03:06:03.349 --> 03:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
something to support
 
03:06:05.510 --> 03:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
their warrant and their execution of the
 
03:06:05.520 --> 03:06:06.550 align:start position:0%
their warrant and their execution of the
warrant

03:06:06.550 --> 03:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
03:06:08.550 --> 03:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
then we would always try to be available
 
03:06:10.389 --> 03:06:10.399 align:start position:0%
to help
 
03:06:13.349 --> 03:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:06:17.429 --> 03:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:33.269 --> 03:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
david larue um
 
03:06:38.309 --> 03:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
now i don't have the answer to uh
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
the question of
 
03:06:39.840 --> 03:06:41.030 align:start position:0%
the question of
who

03:06:41.030 --> 03:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:06:42.870 --> 03:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
who currently would foot the bill if we
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
had state police and local police going
 
03:06:46.870 --> 03:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
along with in support
 
03:06:49.750 --> 03:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
does that come from my tax dollars in my
 
03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
town my state tax dollars
 
03:06:54.230 --> 03:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
i would agree with the premise that if
 
03:06:56.070 --> 03:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
the feds are going to do something well
 
03:06:57.590 --> 03:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
they already take however much of my
 
03:06:59.590 --> 03:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
money that they say they want and i
 
03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't have much to say about it
 
03:07:04.469 --> 03:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
so why don't we not let my town and my
 
03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
local residents and my local taxes also
 
03:07:09.590 --> 03:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
go to that if it's the case and like i
 
03:07:11.590 --> 03:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
say i don't know this is my question
 
03:07:13.429 --> 03:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
where um
 
03:07:15.750 --> 03:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
the towns are reimbursed for whatever
 
03:07:17.590 --> 03:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
their expenses are if the state is
 
03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for uh assisting with the
 
03:07:22.469 --> 03:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
feds then maybe that's uh maybe that's
 
03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
something but ultimately follow the
 
03:07:25.429 --> 03:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
money trail
 
03:07:27.510 --> 03:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
we do talk a lot about state versus
 
03:07:29.750 --> 03:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
federal and we have lots of examples in
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
other areas outside of firearms where
 
03:07:35.429 --> 03:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
there is federal overreach and if it was
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
a policy that was good policy for new
 
03:07:40.070 --> 03:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire i would think we would have it
 
03:07:43.110 --> 03:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
we spend 365 days a year arguing about
 
03:07:45.030 --> 03:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
state policy so if we don't have
 
03:07:47.429 --> 03:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
something on the books for new hampshire
 
03:07:50.150 --> 03:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
we should probably slow down and examine
 
03:07:51.830 --> 03:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
why we're assisting the feds in doing
 
03:07:54.389 --> 03:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
that that said i am a great supporter of
 
03:07:57.190 --> 03:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
our union and i love being part of the
 
03:07:58.469 --> 03:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
federal government i think there are
 
03:08:00.950 --> 03:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
great protections um you know so this is
 
03:08:02.790 --> 03:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
definitely a sticky situation that
 
03:08:04.550 --> 03:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
requires a lot of thought
 
03:08:06.309 --> 03:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know the ramifications on the
 
03:08:08.950 --> 03:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
judicial side and the state police side
 
03:08:10.469 --> 03:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
but i definitely think the premise is
 
03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
solid and maybe needs some uh
 
03:08:14.309 --> 03:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
reevaluation maybe a little bit more
 
03:08:16.389 --> 03:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
added to it adjusted
 
03:08:17.910 --> 03:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
but i definitely think the money is the
 
03:08:17.920 --> 03:08:23.510 align:start position:0%
but i definitely think the money is the
question

03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:24.870 --> 03:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
there be no questions thank you for your
 
03:08:24.880 --> 03:08:27.349 align:start position:0%
there be no questions thank you for your
testimony

03:08:27.349 --> 03:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls joe hannon
 
03:08:35.510 --> 03:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:38.150 --> 03:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon hi members of the
 
03:08:39.750 --> 03:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh trying to make this as
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
painless as possible uh also i know a
 
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
few people mentioned earlier that they
 
03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:44.630 align:start position:0%
few people mentioned earlier that they
are

03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
like some other people mentioned i am
 
03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
also not a paid lobbyist i'm a volunteer
 
03:08:50.469 --> 03:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
for gunners of new hampshire as are all
 
03:08:51.429 --> 03:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
of our
 
03:08:53.349 --> 03:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
board members and and anyone who works
 
03:08:55.510 --> 03:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
with our organization
 
03:08:58.150 --> 03:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
i haven't received any money to any big
 
03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
money to push any legislation since i
 
03:09:02.230 --> 03:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
was a state representative
 
03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:03.510 align:start position:0%
was a state representative
so

03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:09:06.309 --> 03:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you um i'll be here all day
 
03:09:09.190 --> 03:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
seriously i will um
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
so one thing i'd like to say about this
 
03:09:13.750 --> 03:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill is that this would not nullify any
 
03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
federal regulations or laws orders or
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
actions it just means that we're not
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to be complicit in violating the
 
03:09:22.710 --> 03:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
second amendment rights of people in new
 
03:09:22.720 --> 03:09:24.389 align:start position:0%
second amendment rights of people in new
hampshire

03:09:24.389 --> 03:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:09:26.070 --> 03:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's very simple
 
03:09:27.750 --> 03:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
i mentioned last week in another
 
03:09:29.750 --> 03:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
unrelated bill about how new hampshire
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
has a history of fighting uh
 
03:09:34.469 --> 03:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
federal rules or regulations that we
 
03:09:37.269 --> 03:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
just we deemed unjust uh i'm you may
 
03:09:38.550 --> 03:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
recall i've talked about the fugitive
 
03:09:40.070 --> 03:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
slave acts
 
03:09:40.080 --> 03:09:40.950 align:start position:0%
slave acts
and

03:09:40.950 --> 03:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:09:42.309 --> 03:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was actually one of the
 
03:09:46.070 --> 03:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
states that didn't want to support
 
03:09:47.750 --> 03:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
putting people in jail or finding people
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
for violating these and forcing our
 
03:09:53.349 --> 03:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
courts to to take these those cases
 
03:09:55.269 --> 03:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
um we didn't win
 
03:09:57.429 --> 03:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
we had to fight a war over that and the
 
03:09:59.190 --> 03:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
13th amendment finally did away with
 
03:10:00.790 --> 03:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
that but this is something very simple
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
we can do
 
03:10:03.190 --> 03:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
you may have heard it said it's a
 
03:10:04.950 --> 03:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
statement it is a statement but it also
 
03:10:07.910 --> 03:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
is something that that reiterates how
 
03:10:09.429 --> 03:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
important it is
 
03:10:09.439 --> 03:10:10.229 align:start position:0%
important it is
to

03:10:10.229 --> 03:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:10:12.070 --> 03:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
differentiate the federal laws and we're
 
03:10:14.150 --> 03:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
actually making a stand for our rights
 
03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:17.510 align:start position:0%
actually making a stand for our rights
um

03:10:17.510 --> 03:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:19.990 --> 03:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's we heard uh talk about testimony
 
03:10:21.190 --> 03:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
about how
 
03:10:23.429 --> 03:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to enforce any federal
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
regulations or laws
 
03:10:25.200 --> 03:10:26.469 align:start position:0%
regulations or laws
this

03:10:26.469 --> 03:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:10:28.710 --> 03:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
and by my reading just says
 
03:10:31.030 --> 03:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
that it won't uh help with anything
 
03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's inconsistent with any law of the
 
03:10:34.950 --> 03:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
state regarding specifically regulation
 
03:10:36.710 --> 03:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
of firearms ammunitions magazines or the
 
03:10:37.990 --> 03:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
ammunition feeding devices firearms
 
03:10:41.269 --> 03:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
components firearm supplies or knives
 
03:10:43.990 --> 03:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know how a drug
 
03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
case could be hindered by a
 
03:10:48.790 --> 03:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
firearm anyway and i don't think that
 
03:10:49.830 --> 03:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
that would be something that would be
 
03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
very hard to
 
03:10:52.550 --> 03:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
get around if they needed to do
 
03:10:53.830 --> 03:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
something like that if they wanted to do
 
03:10:56.790 --> 03:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
a drug joint task force or case they
 
03:10:58.150 --> 03:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
have plenty of things to go after them
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
for if they in fact are trying to
 
03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
enforce drug laws you know the
 
03:11:02.550 --> 03:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
possession of a firearm is usually an
 
03:11:04.630 --> 03:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
ancillary charge and if that's the only
 
03:11:06.309 --> 03:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
thing they have
 
03:11:07.990 --> 03:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
drug dealers and felons aren't supposed
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
to have a firearm anyway so i don't know
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
how that would be inconsistent with
 
03:11:13.510 --> 03:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
state law it would have to be a new
 
03:11:14.630 --> 03:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
person that they really don't have a
 
03:11:17.429 --> 03:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
history on uh or record and they don't
 
03:11:18.790 --> 03:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
have a good case to begin with so i
 
03:11:20.550 --> 03:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
think that's a bit of a stretch
 
03:11:20.560 --> 03:11:23.030 align:start position:0%
think that's a bit of a stretch
um

03:11:23.030 --> 03:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not opposed we're not opposed to
 
03:11:26.790 --> 03:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
any penalties for violation although i
 
03:11:28.630 --> 03:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
do think that they can be very difficult
 
03:11:30.630 --> 03:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
to um
 
03:11:34.070 --> 03:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
legislate and to to uh
 
03:11:36.870 --> 03:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
to uphold um you'd have to prove that
 
03:11:38.229 --> 03:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
they were doing it in malice or they
 
03:11:39.670 --> 03:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
actually had direct knowledge that there
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
was something involved
 
03:11:42.870 --> 03:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that would be very
 
03:11:44.950 --> 03:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
helpful although we're not against it
 
03:11:46.550 --> 03:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh one of the main reasons for doing
 
03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
something like this isn't just
 
03:11:50.550 --> 03:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
03:11:52.469 --> 03:11:52.479 align:start position:0%
just merely federal overreach it could
 
03:11:54.389 --> 03:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
be something as simple as
 
03:11:55.830 --> 03:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a ban against a
 
03:11:57.990 --> 03:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
component that's made in new hampshire
 
03:11:58.000 --> 03:11:58.950 align:start position:0%
component that's made in new hampshire
and

03:11:58.950 --> 03:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:12:01.030 --> 03:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
if it's not allowed to be sold at the
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
market at the federal level interstate
 
03:12:03.750 --> 03:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
commerce could apply but we could still
 
03:12:05.190 --> 03:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
have it in new hampshire and the feds
 
03:12:07.269 --> 03:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't do anything about it
 
03:12:09.670 --> 03:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
here so
 
03:12:12.070 --> 03:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take any questions and i
 
03:12:14.229 --> 03:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
do support this bill and i recommend dr
 
03:12:14.239 --> 03:12:18.070 align:start position:0%
do support this bill and i recommend dr
pass

03:12:18.070 --> 03:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:19.510 --> 03:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
there being no questions thank you for
 
03:12:22.389 --> 03:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:24.309 --> 03:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls attorney penny
 
03:12:24.319 --> 03:12:33.190 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls attorney penny
dean

03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
i'm penny dean i'm a concord resident
 
03:12:37.990 --> 03:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i have three points
 
03:12:39.990 --> 03:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
the first point and i think it's an
 
03:12:42.389 --> 03:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
important point is what i call scare
 
03:12:45.030 --> 03:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
tactics oh we're going to lose millions
 
03:12:48.309 --> 03:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
of dollars oh what are we going to do
 
03:12:48.319 --> 03:12:49.110 align:start position:0%
of dollars oh what are we going to do
well

03:12:49.110 --> 03:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:12:50.950 --> 03:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
here's the whole thing
 
03:12:52.950 --> 03:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
if these government agencies thought
 
03:12:54.150 --> 03:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
they were going to lose millions of
 
03:12:56.469 --> 03:12:56.479 align:start position:0%
dollars in grants they're here prepared
 
03:12:58.950 --> 03:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill they should have
 
03:13:01.030 --> 03:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
brought two or three examples here's a
 
03:13:01.040 --> 03:13:02.070 align:start position:0%
brought two or three examples here's a
grant

03:13:02.070 --> 03:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
grant
 
03:13:03.990 --> 03:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
here's the exact wording in the grant
 
03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
here's the opinion from the attorney
 
03:13:07.510 --> 03:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
general and not that we might but we
 
03:13:10.070 --> 03:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
will lose the money of this grant
 
03:13:12.229 --> 03:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
we will because that's what you need not
 
03:13:12.239 --> 03:13:13.110 align:start position:0%
we will because that's what you need not
maybe

03:13:13.110 --> 03:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:13:14.389 --> 03:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
we will
 
03:13:16.229 --> 03:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
that's number one
 
03:13:18.389 --> 03:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
number two
 
03:13:20.309 --> 03:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
i support this bill
 
03:13:23.190 --> 03:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
with a couple of amendments
 
03:13:25.269 --> 03:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
and one can be added later one
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
definitely needs to be added now
 
03:13:30.150 --> 03:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
and i think the what if part is really
 
03:13:32.229 --> 03:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
important because if we had all these
 
03:13:34.469 --> 03:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
speed limit signs on the highways and
 
03:13:36.550 --> 03:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
they didn't have the green meanies there
 
03:13:37.990 --> 03:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
with their little radar guns that could
 
03:13:39.510 --> 03:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
pull you over and give you a ticket how
 
03:13:40.950 --> 03:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
many people would pay attention to those
 
03:13:42.870 --> 03:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
signs it's because they know that
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
somebody can get pulled over and get a
 
03:13:44.399 --> 03:13:46.070 align:start position:0%
somebody can get pulled over and get a
ticket

03:13:46.070 --> 03:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
03:13:48.790 --> 03:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
so if we don't have a what if
 
03:13:50.070 --> 03:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
in here
 
03:13:52.309 --> 03:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
then i think this is really nice and
 
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
feels good but it's not ultimately going
 
03:13:58.070 --> 03:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
to help us and the last point to me is
 
03:14:00.550 --> 03:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
the biggest point which i got a great
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
chuckle out of it i don't know if all of
 
03:14:04.389 --> 03:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
you remember but a couple hundred years
 
03:14:06.790 --> 03:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
ago or so we had kind of a dust up with
 
03:14:10.309 --> 03:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
the brits over powder
 
03:14:12.389 --> 03:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
there's no provisions here for
 
03:14:14.790 --> 03:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
ammunition components powder primer and
 
03:14:14.800 --> 03:14:16.229 align:start position:0%
ammunition components powder primer and
brass

03:14:16.229 --> 03:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
brass
 
03:14:18.229 --> 03:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
needs to be in there
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
because you can take all our ammo but if
 
03:14:22.870 --> 03:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
we got powder primer and brass we can
 
03:14:24.710 --> 03:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
make ammo
 
03:14:26.950 --> 03:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's an important thing
 
03:14:28.870 --> 03:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
and just as important as firearm
 
03:14:31.750 --> 03:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
components as ammunition components
 
03:14:34.469 --> 03:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
and at least the judges that i go before
 
03:14:35.830 --> 03:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
you'll hear them say all the time the
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
legislature says what it means and means
 
03:14:39.110 --> 03:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
what it says we're not going to add
 
03:14:41.190 --> 03:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
words we're not going to subtract words
 
03:14:43.030 --> 03:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
and if those specific words aren't in
 
03:14:44.630 --> 03:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
there they're going to say tough luck
 
03:14:44.640 --> 03:14:45.830 align:start position:0%
there they're going to say tough luck
chuck

03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
chuck
 
03:14:47.349 --> 03:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
they'll say it fancier but it's tough
 
03:14:48.790 --> 03:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
luck chuck
 
03:14:48.800 --> 03:14:49.590 align:start position:0%
luck chuck
so

03:14:49.590 --> 03:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:14:52.229 --> 03:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
i strongly support this bill it's a good
 
03:14:52.239 --> 03:14:53.269 align:start position:0%
i strongly support this bill it's a good
bill

03:14:53.269 --> 03:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:14:55.190 --> 03:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
but i think those three things are
 
03:14:57.269 --> 03:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
things you have to think about powder
 
03:14:59.110 --> 03:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
primer and brass ammunition components
 
03:15:01.510 --> 03:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
need to be added in
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
you can pass it i think the second part
 
03:15:07.030 --> 03:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
actually needs to have a little if any
 
03:15:08.870 --> 03:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
terms they have a savings clause here
 
03:15:11.269 --> 03:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
which is good but terms need to be added
 
03:15:13.110 --> 03:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
to the savings clause
 
03:15:14.550 --> 03:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
to make it
 
03:15:17.910 --> 03:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
as bulletproof as you can make anything
 
03:15:20.309 --> 03:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
but those are the big issues and i think
 
03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
the thing that this committee should be
 
03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
asking people for when they come to you
 
03:15:26.229 --> 03:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
is if you're going to say these things
 
03:15:28.469 --> 03:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
might happen we not we've got to know if
 
03:15:29.910 --> 03:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
they will because you guys are making
 
03:15:31.590 --> 03:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
really important decisions hopefully to
 
03:15:33.590 --> 03:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
protect all of us
 
03:15:35.590 --> 03:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
and some might be scared away by scare
 
03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:36.790 align:start position:0%
and some might be scared away by scare
tactics

03:15:36.790 --> 03:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
tactics
 
03:15:41.910 --> 03:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:43.750 --> 03:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
there being no questions thank you hold
 
03:15:43.760 --> 03:15:45.190 align:start position:0%
there being no questions thank you hold
on

03:15:45.190 --> 03:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:15:45.200 --> 03:15:46.070 align:start position:0%
on
sorry

03:15:46.070 --> 03:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:15:48.950 --> 03:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative true thank you mr chair
 
03:15:51.269 --> 03:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
03:15:53.349 --> 03:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
you were talking about uh
 
03:15:56.150 --> 03:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a gap of primers
 
03:15:59.030 --> 03:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
brass and uh and
 
03:16:00.710 --> 03:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
powder yes
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
you don't think that comes under firearm
 
03:16:07.269 --> 03:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
supplies nope or ammunition nope because
 
03:16:09.429 --> 03:16:09.439 align:start position:0%
ammunition is a loaded cartridge which
 
03:16:11.830 --> 03:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
contains powder primer and brass i
 
03:16:13.830 --> 03:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
happen to be an old school as my uncle
 
03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
would call it custom crafted ammunition
 
03:16:18.469 --> 03:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
not reloader custom crafted ammunition
 
03:16:21.429 --> 03:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
and so no i don't think it because
 
03:16:23.030 --> 03:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
ammunition is a specific thing it's
 
03:16:23.040 --> 03:16:25.190 align:start position:0%
ammunition is a specific thing it's
loaded

03:16:25.190 --> 03:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
loaded
 
03:16:27.349 --> 03:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah sorry i just think you
 
03:16:32.389 --> 03:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:33.910 --> 03:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
there be no further questions thank you
 
03:16:41.429 --> 03:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:43.510 --> 03:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
at this point there be no one else to
 
03:16:45.750 --> 03:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
testify i'm going to close the public
 
03:16:45.760 --> 03:16:47.030 align:start position:0%
testify i'm going to close the public
hearing

03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:16:48.870 --> 03:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
on hp
 
03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
1178 and the committee will stand in
 
03:16:55.590 --> 03:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
recess until 1 30.
 
03:16:56.469 --> 03:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to probably do a
 
03:17:23.030 --> 03:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%

oh

04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:20.080 --> 04:29:58.950 align:start position:0%

04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's why i like hanging out with these
 
04:30:31.520 --> 04:30:54.389 align:start position:0%
that's why i like hanging out with these
kids

04:30:54.389 --> 04:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%

committee
 
04:31:59.110 --> 04:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
i did i did establish three
 
04:32:00.870 --> 04:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittees today
 
04:32:03.110 --> 04:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
if the members wish to schedule a
 
04:32:05.670 --> 04:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing
 
04:32:05.680 --> 04:32:06.469 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing

uh
 
04:32:07.750 --> 04:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
those are going to be chaired by
 
04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative roy but just
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
please communicate with the
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
chair that those subcommittees so we can
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
actually schedule those properly we
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the free will to schedule
 
04:32:18.870 --> 04:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
hearings as we wish
 
04:32:21.590 --> 04:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't look like we actually will
 
04:32:23.110 --> 04:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
have anything scheduled next wednesday
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
we will have a light
 
04:32:27.429 --> 04:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
day on friday so i would anticipate
 
04:32:29.830 --> 04:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
there being some subcommittee hearings
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
that can be worked into that day as well
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:38.790 --> 04:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
ah thank you mr chair i got i think i
 
04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
got two 15 40 and 12 66 what was the
 
04:32:47.349 --> 04:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh hb 1215
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
is also a subcommittee
 
04:32:51.840 --> 04:32:52.830 align:start position:0%
is also a subcommittee
hb

04:32:52.830 --> 04:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
hb
 
04:32:55.670 --> 04:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
1215 that is relative to the definition
 
04:32:57.429 --> 04:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
of a residual amount
 
04:33:24.551 --> 04:33:24.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:27.109 --> 04:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm also going to
 
04:33:29.109 --> 04:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
establish a subcommittee on house bill
 
04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.910 --> 04:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.920 --> 04:33:46.150 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative roy do it you're going to
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
be appointed as a chair of that
 
04:33:48.959 --> 04:33:50.629 align:start position:0%
be appointed as a chair of that

04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
with representative conley and
 
04:34:05.590 --> 04:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:06.869 --> 04:34:06.879 align:start position:0%
representative muse i've appointed you
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
to the subcommittee for hb 1127.
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
1127. you were not here for the public
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on that but i do know
 
04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
it's a similar bill we had last term so
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
i assume you'll be familiar with the
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
subject matter
 
04:34:21.590 --> 04:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
and these will be noticed
 
04:34:31.109 --> 04:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
and just the members understand in all
 
04:34:34.390 --> 04:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
likelihood it would be those would be
 
04:34:36.230 --> 04:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
scheduled in the day that were here for
 
04:34:40.230 --> 04:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:41.750 --> 04:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
at this time we are now going to open
 
04:34:44.310 --> 04:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on house bill
 
04:34:44.320 --> 04:34:46.150 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on house bill
1151

04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair
 
04:35:07.990 --> 04:35:08.000 align:start position:0%

04:35:10.230 --> 04:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
the years i have joined protests and
 
04:35:12.789 --> 04:35:12.799 align:start position:0%
rallies for causes i believe in
 
04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure many of the folks in this room
 
04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
have joined protests marches and
 
04:35:17.840 --> 04:35:19.269 align:start position:0%
have joined protests marches and
demonstrations

04:35:19.269 --> 04:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
demonstrations
 
04:35:21.029 --> 04:35:21.039 align:start position:0%
for the causes that they believe in as
 
04:35:23.590 --> 04:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
well one of the most precious rights we
 
04:35:26.230 --> 04:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
have as citizens is our first amendment
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
right to raise our voices in protest or
 
04:35:31.349 --> 04:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
in support of changes that we as
 
04:35:33.750 --> 04:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
citizens would like to see
 
04:35:35.830 --> 04:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
protecting this right and ensuring that
 
04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
people are free to speak out at rallies
 
04:35:40.070 --> 04:35:40.080 align:start position:0%

and demonstrations without the fear of
intimidation

04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
intimidation
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
is the very act of protecting our
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
democracy itself
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
the last five years have brought us
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
extreme division that has angered
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
frustrated and sad many of us
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
but one of the worst trends the last
 
04:35:56.551 --> 04:35:56.561 align:start position:0%
five years has brought us
 
04:35:59.109 --> 04:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
is the increasing presence of firearms
 
04:36:02.709 --> 04:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
being openly displayed during protests
 
04:36:04.869 --> 04:36:04.879 align:start position:0%
since the start of 2020
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
weapons toting protesters and
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
counter-protesters have been spotted at
 
04:36:12.150 --> 04:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrations in portsmouth concord
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
nashua and manchester
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
governor sununu was also forced to
 
04:36:20.470 --> 04:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
cancel his 2021 inaugural ceremony after
 
04:36:23.349 --> 04:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
armed anti-mask demonstrators marched
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
outside his home in newfields
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
in other parts of the country protesters
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
and counterprotesters have died in
 
04:36:32.949 --> 04:36:32.959 align:start position:0%
gunfire in places like kenosha
 
04:36:36.869 --> 04:36:36.879 align:start position:0%
portland austin and las vegas
 
04:36:38.551 --> 04:36:38.561 align:start position:0%
but these events are just the tip of the
 
04:36:38.561 --> 04:36:40.070 align:start position:0%
but these events are just the tip of the
iceberg

04:36:40.070 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
iceberg
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
according to the armed conflict location
 
04:36:44.949 --> 04:36:44.959 align:start position:0%
and event data project a group that
 
04:36:47.029 --> 04:36:47.039 align:start position:0%
collects data and reports on political
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
violence worldwide
 
04:36:50.869 --> 04:36:50.879 align:start position:0%
over 610
 
04:36:52.869 --> 04:36:52.879 align:start position:0%
armed demonstrations have been reported
 
04:36:55.269 --> 04:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
around the country since the start of
 
04:36:55.279 --> 04:36:57.029 align:start position:0%
around the country since the start of
2020.

04:36:57.029 --> 04:36:57.039 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
04:36:58.869 --> 04:36:58.879 align:start position:0%
the group also reports that armed
 
04:37:02.230 --> 04:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrations are 6.5 times more likely
 
04:37:04.949 --> 04:37:04.959 align:start position:0%
to turn violent or destructive than
 
04:37:06.949 --> 04:37:06.959 align:start position:0%
demonstrations where no firearms are
 
04:37:06.959 --> 04:37:08.629 align:start position:0%
demonstrations where no firearms are
present

04:37:08.629 --> 04:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
present
 
04:37:11.269 --> 04:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
hb 1151 is a bill that seeks to protect
 
04:37:12.869 --> 04:37:12.879 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
second amendment rights
 
04:37:17.830 --> 04:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
and most important of all human lives
 
04:37:21.189 --> 04:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
hb 1151 would ban the open carrying of
 
04:37:24.070 --> 04:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
firearms within 100 feet of a protest
 
04:37:26.551 --> 04:37:26.561 align:start position:0%
rally march or any first amendment
 
04:37:28.310 --> 04:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
related activity that takes place on
 
04:37:29.990 --> 04:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
public property
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
despite what you may have been told the
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
right to self-defense is preserved under
 
04:37:36.551 --> 04:37:36.561 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:37:38.709 --> 04:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
while the bill does restrict open carry
 
04:37:41.109 --> 04:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
and protest it has a pres it has a
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
specific exemption for concealed carry
 
04:37:47.349 --> 04:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
so if being armed makes you feel safer
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
you can carry a weapon
 
04:37:51.750 --> 04:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
but what you can't do is carry it out in
 
04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
the open within 100 feet of other people
 
04:37:57.429 --> 04:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
expressing their first amendment rights
 
04:37:59.189 --> 04:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
currently seven states along with the
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
district of columbia bar firearms and
 
04:38:01.680 --> 04:38:02.949 align:start position:0%
district of columbia bar firearms and

04:38:02.949 --> 04:38:02.959 align:start position:0%
rallies
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
among those states are alabama and north
 
04:38:06.080 --> 04:38:08.070 align:start position:0%
among those states are alabama and north
carolina

04:38:08.070 --> 04:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
carolina
 
04:38:09.429 --> 04:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
over the years our courts have
 
04:38:11.189 --> 04:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
repeatedly ruled that it does not
 
04:38:12.869 --> 04:38:12.879 align:start position:0%
violate the second amendment for the
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
government to prohibit firearms at
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
public events
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
04:38:21.910 --> 04:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
we prohibit firearms from our own courts
 
04:38:24.070 --> 04:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
the u.s supreme court has made it clear
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
in its 2008 decision uh district
 
04:38:29.510 --> 04:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
columbia versus heller that the second
 
04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
amendment and i quote
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
is not a right to keep and carry any
 
04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
weapon whatsoever in any manner
 
04:38:39.029 --> 04:38:39.039 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and for whatever purpose
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has left the door open
 
04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%
for governments to impose reasonable
 
04:38:45.269 --> 04:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
safety restrictions on the possession
 
04:38:47.429 --> 04:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
and use of firearms
 
04:38:49.429 --> 04:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
the courts have also upheld prohibitions
 
04:38:51.269 --> 04:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
on carrying firearms on government
 
04:38:52.869 --> 04:38:52.879 align:start position:0%
government property
 
04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
which suggests that state and local
 
04:38:56.869 --> 04:38:56.879 align:start position:0%
governments can lawfully restrict the
 
04:38:58.709 --> 04:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
carrying of firearms during public
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
events on public property such as public
 
04:39:04.070 --> 04:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
parks streets and other government owned
 
04:39:06.310 --> 04:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
land where demonstrations rallies and
 
04:39:09.029 --> 04:39:09.039 align:start position:0%
marches typically take place
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
some would say that displaying weapons
 
04:39:13.590 --> 04:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
itself is an allowable exercise in free
 
04:39:13.600 --> 04:39:15.029 align:start position:0%
itself is an allowable exercise in free
speech

04:39:15.029 --> 04:39:15.039 align:start position:0%
speech
 
04:39:17.349 --> 04:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
but the right to free speech cannot be
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
confused with the right to terrorize
 
04:39:21.910 --> 04:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
others and threaten public safety
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
though some may attempt to defend the
 
04:39:25.750 --> 04:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
display of firearms in polling places as
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:34.150 --> 04:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
decades of legal precedent make it clear
 
04:39:37.109 --> 04:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
that that would simply not be the case
 
04:39:39.910 --> 04:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
the constitutional right to bear arms uh
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the right to free speech
 
04:39:44.070 --> 04:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
does not inten do not
 
04:39:45.270 --> 04:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
does not
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry does not permit intimidation
 
04:39:49.990 --> 04:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
with deadly weapons
 
04:39:52.708 --> 04:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
the point is is that guns don't speak
 
04:39:54.470 --> 04:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
although they may they may command
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
attention and they may command fear
 
04:39:58.948 --> 04:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
the objects themselves are not
 
04:40:00.948 --> 04:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
inherently expressive
 
04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
people are expressive
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in this bill that
 
04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
restricts anyone's freedom of speech and
 
04:40:09.990 --> 04:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in this bill
 
04:40:12.070 --> 04:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
that restricts anyone's second amendment
 
04:40:12.080 --> 04:40:13.110 align:start position:0%
that restricts anyone's second amendment
rights

04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
rights
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
concealed carry continues to be allowed
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
if you want to bring a gun
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
into a polling into a protest
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
for uh for self-defense reasons you can
 
04:40:24.628 --> 04:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:40:25.990 --> 04:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this bill that would
 
04:40:27.430 --> 04:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit that
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that hb 1151 offers
 
04:40:32.230 --> 04:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
us a way to protect the safety and the
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
rights of citizens engaged in first
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
amendment activities while also
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
protecting their right to self-defense
 
04:40:40.708 --> 04:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
i urge you to give it an ought to pass
 
04:40:40.718 --> 04:40:43.990 align:start position:0%
i urge you to give it an ought to pass
recommendation

04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
i will take any questions the committee
 
04:40:45.520 --> 04:40:48.868 align:start position:0%
i will take any questions the committee
has

04:40:48.868 --> 04:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.270 --> 04:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative burt you were recognized
 
04:40:52.948 --> 04:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:40:58.150 --> 04:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:00.628 --> 04:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
you know when we have an open carry
 
04:41:03.670 --> 04:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
rally for guns people open carry their
 
04:41:05.830 --> 04:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
guns but then i'm looking at the funeral
 
04:41:05.840 --> 04:41:07.110 align:start position:0%
guns but then i'm looking at the funeral
procession

04:41:07.110 --> 04:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
procession
 
04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping it's 40 45 years from now
 
04:41:10.240 --> 04:41:11.270 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping it's 40 45 years from now
but

04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
when the day comes and i kick the bucket
 
04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming there's going to be a lot
 
04:41:17.270 --> 04:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
of people there with open carry guns
 
04:41:19.910 --> 04:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
because i open carry how are they going
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
to go through a funeral possession
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
and if there was a rally in my name
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
people showed up you know how are they
 
04:41:29.350 --> 04:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
going to dis you know show their second
 
04:41:31.270 --> 04:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
amendment rights
 
04:41:33.990 --> 04:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
display because that's what i support
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
the bill does create an exception
 
04:41:36.560 --> 04:41:38.470 align:start position:0%
the bill does create an exception
for

04:41:38.470 --> 04:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:41:42.150 --> 04:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
organizations that are authorized to uh
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
to carry weapons uh during things like
 
04:41:48.150 --> 04:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
parades um and funerals
 
04:41:50.788 --> 04:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
uh and in thing also in things like
 
04:41:52.628 --> 04:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
honor guards
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:01.030 --> 04:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative burt recognized for a
 
04:42:01.040 --> 04:42:02.070 align:start position:0%
representative burt recognized for a
follow-up

04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:42:04.390 --> 04:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i read the bill
 
04:42:06.550 --> 04:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
i could you tell me which line that's on
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
because i don't see where i would be
 
04:42:08.160 --> 04:42:09.830 align:start position:0%
because i don't see where i would be
exempt

04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
04:42:11.910 --> 04:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
i did see the part where
 
04:42:11.920 --> 04:42:13.990 align:start position:0%
i did see the part where
the

04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:42:16.788 --> 04:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
you know for the parade
 
04:42:27.910 --> 04:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:32.868 --> 04:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:34.470 --> 04:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
this subdivision shall not apply to
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%

the print no to the regular and it looks
 
04:42:59.670 --> 04:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
like ordinary uh pistols or revolvers as
 
04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
merchandise nor the members of the armed
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%

uh thank you but it still exempts me
 
04:43:26.788 --> 04:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:29.190 --> 04:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
i would say your your 24 gun salute
 
04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:38.080 --> 04:43:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:43:39.270 --> 04:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:43:41.830 --> 04:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:43:46.430 --> 04:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
on the first page i'm focusing on lines
 
04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
22-23 where it says this section shall
 
04:43:50.948 --> 04:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
apply regardless of whether or not a
 
04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
permit has been secured by the event
 
04:43:52.560 --> 04:43:54.470 align:start position:0%
permit has been secured by the event
organizer

04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
organizer
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
is what is the rationale for
 
04:44:00.628 --> 04:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
not requiring a permit i'm sorry i'm
 
04:44:02.708 --> 04:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
having a hard time hearing your uh
 
04:44:04.868 --> 04:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
it it's my understanding of what the
 
04:44:07.110 --> 04:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
bill says is that if there is any type
 
04:44:09.670 --> 04:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
of demonstration this law would be in
 
04:44:09.680 --> 04:44:10.628 align:start position:0%
of demonstration this law would be in
effect

04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
effect
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
but it applies to
 
04:44:14.230 --> 04:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrations where there was no permit
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
pulled whether
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
even in situations where the law would
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
would require a permit
 
04:44:22.150 --> 04:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
for that organism that demonstration
 
04:44:23.270 --> 04:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking what's the what's the
 
04:44:25.110 --> 04:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
rationale for excluding the permit
 
04:44:27.430 --> 04:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
requirement for the organization
 
04:44:29.590 --> 04:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire if you if you take a
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:44:33.110 --> 04:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
the way demonstrations work for instance
 
04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
in my community in portsmouth
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
a permit is not required to have a
 
04:44:39.750 --> 04:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
demonstration it's a good idea
 
04:44:41.350 --> 04:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
and it's always a good idea to contact
 
04:44:42.868 --> 04:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
the police department before you do
 
04:44:45.030 --> 04:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
something like that but it's not always
 
04:44:46.470 --> 04:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
required in every case in every
 
04:44:46.480 --> 04:44:47.910 align:start position:0%
required in every case in every
municipality

04:44:47.910 --> 04:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
so the goal is to make sure that people
 
04:44:52.150 --> 04:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
who would be
 
04:44:53.510 --> 04:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know who would be exercising their
 
04:44:55.350 --> 04:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights in situations
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
where there wasn't a permit also
 
04:45:00.150 --> 04:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
are protected against intimidation as
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:10.708 --> 04:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:16.310 --> 04:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:17.910 --> 04:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls representative
 
04:45:26.628 --> 04:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:28.628 --> 04:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much i'm
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
representing timothy jorge from stratfor
 
04:45:31.910 --> 04:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
county district six which is the towns
 
04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
of durham and matberry and i'm a
 
04:45:36.788 --> 04:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
i'm a co-sponsor of this bill and i i
 
04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
support it
 
04:45:40.628 --> 04:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
we've seen in uh
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
especially in 2020 we saw a number of
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
really disturbing incidents with people
 
04:45:47.830 --> 04:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh with
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
armed counter protesters threatening
 
04:45:53.670 --> 04:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
peaceful peaceful protesters
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
you know it's
 
04:45:56.470 --> 04:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
people who aren't used to being around
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
openly carried weapons um
 
04:45:58.560 --> 04:45:59.670 align:start position:0%
openly carried weapons um
are

04:45:59.670 --> 04:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:46:00.788 --> 04:46:00.798 align:start position:0%
afraid of them they find that
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
intimidating and you may say that's
 
04:46:04.070 --> 04:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable or not but
 
04:46:06.948 --> 04:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
certainly the physical danger is
 
04:46:08.708 --> 04:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
is real um this
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything to
 
04:46:12.550 --> 04:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
both encounter demonstrators spectators
 
04:46:15.590 --> 04:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
and protest alike and still
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
can still conceal carry and we're
 
04:46:19.510 --> 04:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional carry stage you don't
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
actually need a permit to do this you
 
04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
can still conceal carry
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
for your protection or for whatever
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
other reason you feel you need to need a
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
protest and um
 
04:46:31.910 --> 04:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit confusingly written
 
04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
but there is uh an exception for
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
first of all uh pro second amendment
 
04:46:40.788 --> 04:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
demonstrations or also if you have an
 
04:46:42.310 --> 04:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
honor guard it doesn't have to be a
 
04:46:42.320 --> 04:46:43.510 align:start position:0%
honor guard it doesn't have to be a
government

04:46:43.510 --> 04:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
organization it can just be uh you know
 
04:46:47.830 --> 04:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
any civil organization you can have a
 
04:46:48.788 --> 04:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
you can have
 
04:46:51.110 --> 04:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
rifles hopefully unloaded or loaded with
 
04:46:52.708 --> 04:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
blanks for
 
04:46:55.110 --> 04:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
for uh to be carried at that offense so
 
04:46:56.948 --> 04:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
i think this uh
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
balances the first and second amendment
 
04:47:03.030 --> 04:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh second amendment rights and
 
04:47:04.390 --> 04:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
actually as a point of order i notice
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
when the members of the committee is
 
04:47:07.990 --> 04:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
wearing a pro-second amendment
 
04:47:09.750 --> 04:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
this probably playing a pro-second
 
04:47:12.390 --> 04:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
amendment hat on the one hand i think
 
04:47:14.070 --> 04:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
all of us those who oppose and they'll
 
04:47:15.670 --> 04:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
support the bill recognize that there is
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
a second amendment excuse me
 
04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
the representative will suspend their
 
04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
testimony yeah
 
04:47:22.868 --> 04:47:22.878 align:start position:0%
i you're testifying as a representative
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
but also as a member of the public
 
04:47:25.590 --> 04:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
you're not permitted to make a point of
 
04:47:27.990 --> 04:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
order oh i'm sorry with your testimony
 
04:47:29.590 --> 04:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
i'll just point out that but you may you
 
04:47:31.110 --> 04:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
may continue with your testimony as it
 
04:47:33.670 --> 04:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
relates to the bill and that that is it
 
04:47:35.110 --> 04:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay so that's
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
i think it'll avoid a lot of uh
 
04:47:39.350 --> 04:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
and we've had some some uh some some
 
04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
tragic incidents either with uh you know
 
04:47:42.000 --> 04:47:43.190 align:start position:0%
tragic incidents either with uh you know
people

04:47:43.190 --> 04:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
infiltrating the march and doing violent
 
04:47:47.110 --> 04:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
things although only rarely shooting or
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
we also had a tragic incident in
 
04:47:50.788 --> 04:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
wisconsin where
 
04:47:53.430 --> 04:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
a young man well he went down
 
04:47:55.910 --> 04:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
his goal was to uh somehow protect
 
04:47:57.750 --> 04:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
someone from the protesters and then he
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
ended up
 
04:47:59.440 --> 04:48:00.310 align:start position:0%
ended up
killing

04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
killing
 
04:48:02.230 --> 04:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
killing two people and um you know he
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
was acquitted and i understand why he
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
was acquitted but still that was a
 
04:48:07.110 --> 04:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
tragic thing which i think we had to be
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
less likely to happen in new hampshire
 
04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
if we had that law because it's uh
 
04:48:13.110 --> 04:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
never never a good thing when anyone
 
04:48:15.110 --> 04:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
gets shot and killed regardless of what
 
04:48:16.868 --> 04:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
the motivations of the shooter wear so
 
04:48:18.868 --> 04:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
04:48:19.910 --> 04:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
anyway that
 
04:48:21.910 --> 04:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
um and another thing that happened we
 
04:48:23.430 --> 04:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
often have people coming out and
 
04:48:25.510 --> 04:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
supposedly assisting the police and
 
04:48:26.628 --> 04:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
we've had that even here in new
 
04:48:28.150 --> 04:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire we had
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
although a photo was only one incident
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
out of
 
04:48:33.030 --> 04:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
many there's the somewhat disturbing
 
04:48:34.390 --> 04:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
issue of uh
 
04:48:35.910 --> 04:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
some young man who had some sort of
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
unofficial material militia
 
04:48:39.190 --> 04:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia kind of doing a little bit
 
04:48:40.948 --> 04:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
of fist bump with the state policeman
 
04:48:42.470 --> 04:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
and that certainly
 
04:48:44.788 --> 04:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
created at least in some people
 
04:48:46.470 --> 04:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
eyes the uh
 
04:48:48.628 --> 04:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
the perception that the state police
 
04:48:50.470 --> 04:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
were biased against the protesters even
 
04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
though i mean that probably was not the
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
case but it did sort of look that way
 
04:48:56.628 --> 04:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
with the picture so we'd have fewer
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
embarrassing pictures like that so
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
04:49:02.070 --> 04:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
anyway i mean i'm in favor of the bill
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:06.868 --> 04:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for you having to
 
04:49:08.788 --> 04:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
reprimand me understand that too so
 
04:49:08.798 --> 04:49:10.070 align:start position:0%
reprimand me understand that too so
thanks

04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:49:10.080 --> 04:49:10.788 align:start position:0%
thanks
but

04:49:10.788 --> 04:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
but there is a member of wearing a
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
second amendment hat and i don't think
 
04:49:13.440 --> 04:49:14.788 align:start position:0%
second amendment hat and i don't think
anybody

04:49:14.788 --> 04:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:49:16.948 --> 04:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
can go just interested with with risk
 
04:49:18.628 --> 04:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
your testimony please
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
i've already warned you about this
 
04:49:23.590 --> 04:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
you're can you you want to make an
 
04:49:23.600 --> 04:49:24.868 align:start position:0%
you're can you you want to make an
objection

04:49:24.868 --> 04:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
objection
 
04:49:26.150 --> 04:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
it has to come from a member of the
 
04:49:28.708 --> 04:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
committee okay you're not you're not a
 
04:49:30.150 --> 04:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
member of the committee yes you're
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
testifying before the committee about
 
04:49:33.190 --> 04:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
the bill being introduced to the
 
04:49:34.708 --> 04:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
committee that is what your your
 
04:49:38.310 --> 04:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
testimonies be limited to okay
 
04:49:39.670 --> 04:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
so can i
 
04:49:41.350 --> 04:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
say like why i think this bill does not
 
04:49:44.868 --> 04:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
04:49:47.750 --> 04:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
the second amendment merely says it's
 
04:49:49.350 --> 04:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
infringing the right to bear arms i
 
04:49:51.270 --> 04:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
i think this
 
04:49:55.910 --> 04:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't infringe on the right right
 
04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
right to bear arms which is not absolute
 
04:49:59.670 --> 04:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
and also it uh
 
04:49:59.680 --> 04:50:00.550 align:start position:0%
and also it uh
helps

04:50:00.550 --> 04:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
helps
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
our right to free speech is guaranteed
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
in the first amendment and like many
 
04:50:05.510 --> 04:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
other and
 
04:50:10.550 --> 04:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:12.390 --> 04:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
so if you haven't haven't answered any
 
04:50:17.110 --> 04:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
representative drew
 
04:50:20.230 --> 04:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
in testimony you know people have said
 
04:50:27.350 --> 04:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
that this this is to
 
04:50:30.150 --> 04:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
help improve uh the safety of of the
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
public yeah
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
how how is the public how would the
 
04:50:37.190 --> 04:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
public be more safe
 
04:50:39.430 --> 04:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
if i'm carrying a knife
 
04:50:40.868 --> 04:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
in my poc in my
 
04:50:40.878 --> 04:50:42.310 align:start position:0%
in my poc in my
concealed

04:50:42.310 --> 04:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
concealed
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
versus i'm carrying a knife not
 
04:50:47.350 --> 04:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
concealed how does that make them more
 
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
more safe
 
04:50:49.040 --> 04:50:50.788 align:start position:0%
more safe
well

04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:50:52.390 --> 04:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
i mean it creates a more confrontive
 
04:50:55.510 --> 04:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
situation um you know if the protesters
 
04:50:56.788 --> 04:50:56.798 align:start position:0%
start yelling back at the counter
 
04:50:59.590 --> 04:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
protesters vice versa if somebody has a
 
04:51:01.830 --> 04:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know a rifle especially a loaded one
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
that uh just they're up the ante makes
 
04:51:05.910 --> 04:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
people more makes emotions run higher
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
and then there is the possibility
 
04:51:09.030 --> 04:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
somebody might
 
04:51:09.040 --> 04:51:10.150 align:start position:0%
somebody might
might

04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
might
 
04:51:12.550 --> 04:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
use their weapon and then or have some
 
04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
other forms of violence and then also um
 
04:51:18.390 --> 04:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know but then the concealed carry
 
04:51:20.230 --> 04:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's just not as confrontive so like
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
until you pull it out nobody nobody
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
knows you have it so it's uh
 
04:51:24.718 --> 04:51:25.510 align:start position:0%
knows you have it so it's uh
it

04:51:25.510 --> 04:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:51:28.150 --> 04:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
won't uh it's not like won't
 
04:51:29.670 --> 04:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
pour gasoline on the flames of an
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
already tense situation as much as open
 
04:51:35.910 --> 04:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%

the committee now calls representative
 
04:51:53.190 --> 04:51:53.200 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman thank you
committee

04:52:15.670 --> 04:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:52:16.670 --> 04:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
1151 is a bill about the coercive
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
control of those people who are seeking
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
to negatively influence the freedom of
 
04:52:24.240 --> 04:52:25.350 align:start position:0%
to negatively influence the freedom of
speech

04:52:25.350 --> 04:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
speech
 
04:52:27.510 --> 04:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
and the freedom of assembly by other
 
04:52:29.430 --> 04:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
granite staters
 
04:52:31.350 --> 04:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
if a person goes walking through the
 
04:52:33.190 --> 04:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
aisles of the market basket carrying a
 
04:52:35.750 --> 04:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
baseball bat around not hitting anything
 
04:52:38.470 --> 04:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily coming near anyone
 
04:52:41.190 --> 04:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
not saying anything maybe just
 
04:52:43.590 --> 04:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
striding through the aisles and carrying
 
04:52:45.270 --> 04:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
it on their shoulder
 
04:52:47.830 --> 04:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
do you think that kind of behavior
 
04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
will cause alarm of course it will
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
because a baseball bat is something that
 
04:52:54.708 --> 04:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
is unusual to carry around the
 
04:52:57.270 --> 04:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
supermarket it is not normal it's
 
04:52:59.590 --> 04:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
alarming and it should be
 
04:53:01.270 --> 04:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
let's say you go to a restaurant and the
 
04:53:03.590 --> 04:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
person at the next table
 
04:53:05.350 --> 04:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
pulls out a ten and three quarter inch
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
whaling knife
 
04:53:08.470 --> 04:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know the survival knife with the
 
04:53:10.628 --> 04:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
serrated edge and the gut hook
 
04:53:12.150 --> 04:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
so they put it and they just put it on

the table for everyone to see
 
04:53:17.190 --> 04:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
why on earth would they do that
 
04:53:19.510 --> 04:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
ostensibly everything in the restaurant
 
04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
is already dead
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
and the restaurant
 
04:53:24.868 --> 04:53:24.878 align:start position:0%
provides their own cutlery
 
04:53:27.750 --> 04:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's an unusual item to bring into a
 
04:53:30.310 --> 04:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
restaurant and put on the table that is
 
04:53:33.510 --> 04:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
an alarming situation it should be
 
04:53:36.310 --> 04:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
these instances are examples of coercive
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
control they are actions
 
04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
taken that send a message to the people
 
04:53:42.628 --> 04:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
around them
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
that the balance of power is in their
 
04:53:47.190 --> 04:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
favor because they have introduced an
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
item that is unusual to its surroundings
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
and circumstances
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
and they have demonstrated a
 
04:53:56.550 --> 04:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
comfortableness with threatening
 
04:53:59.190 --> 04:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
that is coercive control
 
04:54:01.110 --> 04:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
neither one of these situations are
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
normal behavior we wouldn't accept it
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough though no coalition
 
04:54:09.750 --> 04:54:09.760 align:start position:0%

04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
normalize the use of bats in places
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
other than baseball games
 
04:54:16.070 --> 04:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
there are no campaigns by hunting knife
 
04:54:18.470 --> 04:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
companies to byok
 
04:54:20.390 --> 04:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
trying to normalize bringing your own

but this year but every year this
 
04:54:26.788 --> 04:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
legislature hears bills that seek to
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
normalize the presence of firearms
 
04:54:29.440 --> 04:54:30.550 align:start position:0%
normalize the presence of firearms
everywhere

04:54:30.550 --> 04:54:30.560 align:start position:0%

04:54:43.910 --> 04:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
why not bring your gun to someone else's

04:54:55.350 --> 04:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
this type of behavior is all in an
 
04:54:57.670 --> 04:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
effort to normalize the presence of the
 
04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
most lethal means of coercive control in
 
04:55:02.788 --> 04:55:02.798 align:start position:0%
our communities
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
seeks to affirm that coercive control by
 
04:55:09.910 --> 04:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
lethal means is not something we want to
 
04:55:12.708 --> 04:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
normalize in new hampshire coercive
 
04:55:15.670 --> 04:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
control creates unequal power dynamics
 
04:55:17.110 --> 04:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
in a relationship
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
it is a form of violence

it is a key factor

in domestic abuse and intimate partner
 
04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:26.400 align:start position:0%

violence it is a part of the pattern of
behaviors

04:55:27.670 --> 04:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
behaviors
 
04:55:30.230 --> 04:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
that perpetrators of coercive control
 
04:55:31.990 --> 04:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
use to gain
 
04:55:35.430 --> 04:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
power and control over their situations
 
04:55:37.110 --> 04:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
coercive control is an act of
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
intimidation it is a silent threat it
 
04:55:42.550 --> 04:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
breaks down boundaries and it threatens

when someone has a firearm they don't
 
04:55:49.590 --> 04:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
need to wave it around its presence is a
 
04:55:51.990 --> 04:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
threat alone
 
04:55:54.070 --> 04:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
ask any victim of domestic violence
 
04:55:56.070 --> 04:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
whose abuser never pointed a weapon at
 
04:55:57.750 --> 04:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
them but would take it out and leave it
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
on the kitchen table as a warning
 
04:56:02.230 --> 04:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
ask the victim whose date ended in
 
04:56:04.230 --> 04:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
sexual assault why they froze when the
 
04:56:05.910 --> 04:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
weapon came out of the glove compartment
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
just for show ask someone who's attended
 
04:56:11.270 --> 04:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
a gun violence prevention rally why they
 
04:56:13.110 --> 04:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
scurried back to their car
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
because counter protesters showed up
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:21.590 --> 04:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
ask the family members who lost lost a
 
04:56:23.670 --> 04:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
loved one to gun violence how normal it
 
04:56:23.680 --> 04:56:24.550 align:start position:0%
loved one to gun violence how normal it
feels

04:56:24.550 --> 04:56:24.560 align:start position:0%

have no permit no training and for all
 
04:56:31.990 --> 04:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
anyone knows no background check and
 
04:56:34.070 --> 04:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
acquiring that weapon because private
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
sales don't require it in new hampshire
 
04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'll share with you that those are all
 
04:56:40.708 --> 04:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
people i have worked with and the
 
04:56:42.390 --> 04:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
presence of a gun
 
04:56:45.190 --> 04:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
has improved none of those situations
 
04:56:47.590 --> 04:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
normalizing the presence of firearms in
 
04:56:49.350 --> 04:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
all parts of our lives
 
04:56:51.990 --> 04:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
is the goal of many gun enthusiast
 
04:56:54.390 --> 04:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
lobbyists here in new hampshire because
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%

would apply
 
04:58:50.868 --> 04:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
what was the rationale for
 
04:58:52.550 --> 04:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
creating this presumption for an

the co-authors of the bill

hunting racks in their house in their in
 
04:59:12.390 --> 04:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
their own cars it it seems to only apply

to a pickup truck
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering why if there was a
 
04:59:18.230 --> 04:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
specific reason to allow a pickup truck
 
04:59:20.310 --> 04:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
to fall under the

exception but not other types of
vehicles

04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
04:59:26.550 --> 04:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mr chairman i'm aware i'm not
 
04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
aware of any kind of vehicle that also
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
accommodates a gun rack in it other than
 
04:59:33.910 --> 04:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
pickup trucks is there another one i'm
 
04:59:36.470 --> 04:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
i'm unaware of that
 
04:59:38.868 --> 04:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
if that is if that is the sticking point
 
04:59:41.270 --> 04:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that the co-sponsors would be
 
04:59:44.470 --> 04:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
happy to create an amendment to address
 
04:59:47.430 --> 04:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
that particular those particular lines
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
i was just asking if there was a reason
 
04:59:50.868 --> 04:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
for having a pickup truck under the
 
04:59:56.390 --> 04:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:58.628 --> 04:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
again if there is if that's the sticking
 
05:00:01.190 --> 05:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
point we will happily make the exception
 
05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
we will happily write an amendment
 
05:00:03.360 --> 05:00:04.788 align:start position:0%
we will happily write an amendment
um

05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:07.350 --> 05:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
to clarify that and would welcome your
 
05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
input on making that amendment
 
05:00:09.040 --> 05:00:12.628 align:start position:0%
input on making that amendment
absolutely

05:00:12.628 --> 05:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:00:13.920 --> 05:00:15.190 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
certainly

05:00:15.190 --> 05:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:00:16.708 --> 05:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative testament
 
05:00:19.910 --> 05:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:21.990 --> 05:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
fear and trepidation
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
around firearms
 
05:00:28.628 --> 05:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't a better way
 
05:00:28.638 --> 05:00:29.910 align:start position:0%
wouldn't a better way
be

05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:00:29.920 --> 05:00:30.788 align:start position:0%
be
of

05:00:30.788 --> 05:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:00:34.390 --> 05:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
having a good firearm safety course
 
05:00:36.788 --> 05:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
as part of the school curriculum we have
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
all sorts of other safety courses to
 
05:00:39.120 --> 05:00:39.830 align:start position:0%
all sorts of other safety courses to
keep

05:00:39.830 --> 05:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
keep
 
05:00:41.430 --> 05:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
kids fear
 
05:00:43.990 --> 05:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
from you know being exacerbated by
 
05:00:45.670 --> 05:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
whatever the item is
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
what i mean
 
05:00:49.510 --> 05:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
would there be a place
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
in our schools
 
05:00:53.830 --> 05:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
to educate them how not to be afraid of
 
05:00:59.590 --> 05:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:00.550 --> 05:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:01:03.510 --> 05:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative testerman as far as
 
05:01:05.830 --> 05:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
firearm awareness in
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
i should think that
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
if there were
 
05:01:16.470 --> 05:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
some curriculum that would
 
05:01:16.480 --> 05:01:17.510 align:start position:0%
some curriculum that would
help

05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
students understand
 
05:01:23.190 --> 05:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
what coercive control is and how deadly
 
05:01:25.590 --> 05:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
firearms are
 
05:01:28.390 --> 05:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
and how they do not improve
 
05:01:30.150 --> 05:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
situations where people are exercising
 
05:01:32.310 --> 05:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
their free speech that would probably be
 
05:01:37.030 --> 05:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:38.470 --> 05:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative testimony recognized for
 
05:01:39.670 --> 05:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
05:01:41.910 --> 05:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
but what you're saying
 
05:01:44.310 --> 05:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
and what i want to know isn't that just
 
05:01:44.320 --> 05:01:45.670 align:start position:0%
and what i want to know isn't that just
really

05:01:45.670 --> 05:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
reinforcing your feelings about the
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:57.510 --> 05:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:57.520 --> 05:01:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
when

05:01:59.430 --> 05:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:02:00.628 --> 05:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
when people
 
05:02:07.270 --> 05:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
come to a come to a funeral rally parade
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
for instance like the
 
05:02:12.470 --> 05:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
the evening vigil that we hold
 
05:02:14.550 --> 05:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
in october for
 
05:02:16.868 --> 05:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
domestic violence victims or the gun
 
05:02:18.788 --> 05:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
violence prevention rallies that we have
 
05:02:18.798 --> 05:02:20.550 align:start position:0%
violence prevention rallies that we have
held

05:02:20.550 --> 05:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
held
 
05:02:24.708 --> 05:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
and when counter protesters show up
 
05:02:28.150 --> 05:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
with multiple firearms and
 
05:02:31.110 --> 05:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
weapons all over them
 
05:02:31.120 --> 05:02:31.990 align:start position:0%
weapons all over them
um

05:02:31.990 --> 05:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
that we it's our fault for feeling
 
05:02:38.150 --> 05:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
intimidated by that coercive control
 
05:02:40.230 --> 05:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
because i don't know that i think that
 
05:02:42.070 --> 05:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate thing would be to
 
05:02:44.070 --> 05:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
teach people not to threaten and
 
05:02:46.470 --> 05:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
intimidate their
 
05:02:47.830 --> 05:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
fellow granite staters who are
 
05:02:57.190 --> 05:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:58.550 --> 05:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative burt you're recognized
 
05:02:59.910 --> 05:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
05:03:01.430 --> 05:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:03:04.628 --> 05:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
if you or somebody else is so afraid why
 
05:03:15.750 --> 05:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:19.110 --> 05:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
so i think what you're asking me is that
 
05:03:21.670 --> 05:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
why don't we have more guns everywhere
 
05:03:23.510 --> 05:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
for everyone
 
05:03:23.520 --> 05:03:24.788 align:start position:0%
for everyone
and

05:03:24.788 --> 05:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this legislation
 
05:03:31.350 --> 05:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
is to create spaces for people to grieve
 
05:03:34.070 --> 05:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
mourn rally
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
in places where their choice
 
05:03:40.550 --> 05:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
not to carry a firearm is not
 
05:03:40.560 --> 05:03:42.070 align:start position:0%
not to carry a firearm is not
um

05:03:42.070 --> 05:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:44.230 --> 05:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
is is acknowledged and that they are not
 
05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
threatened with the coercive control
 
05:03:47.520 --> 05:03:49.110 align:start position:0%
threatened with the coercive control
of

05:03:49.110 --> 05:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:03:51.590 --> 05:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
groups of people or even just one person
 
05:03:53.910 --> 05:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
as has happened right here on the steps
 
05:03:55.590 --> 05:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
in concord who show up
 
05:03:58.708 --> 05:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
with multiple firearms to create
 
05:03:58.718 --> 05:03:59.910 align:start position:0%
with multiple firearms to create
um

05:03:59.910 --> 05:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:02.788 --> 05:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
to create a you know a space that is
 
05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
wildly unsafe
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:13.510 --> 05:04:13.520 align:start position:0%

anecdotal stories so i'd like to quickly
 
05:04:50.708 --> 05:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
just hit one i know i said i would be
 
05:04:52.070 --> 05:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
only two minutes but
 
05:04:54.550 --> 05:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna be a bit longer
 
05:04:54.560 --> 05:04:57.430 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna be a bit longer
um

05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:58.830 --> 05:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
when it comes
 
05:05:01.190 --> 05:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
to parades
 
05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
funerals pickets
 
05:05:05.670 --> 05:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
lines marches
 
05:05:07.510 --> 05:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
rallies demonstrations i've been to all
 
05:05:09.190 --> 05:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
of these things
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
and in my life i don't understand why it
 
05:05:12.240 --> 05:05:13.030 align:start position:0%
and in my life i don't understand why it
is

05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
that i would have to give up
 
05:05:17.990 --> 05:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
my fundamental god-given right to
 
05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
protect myself my family my friends in
 
05:05:22.550 --> 05:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
my state because i want to go to some
 
05:05:25.510 --> 05:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
place because somebody else has a
 
05:05:27.510 --> 05:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
pathological fear
 
05:05:29.910 --> 05:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
of something
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
i i got a quick example it was mentioned
 
05:05:35.510 --> 05:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
out here earlier of some rallies
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
at the state house with a lot of folks
 
05:05:39.990 --> 05:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
at guns i've been to a couple of these
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
they range from 300 to 700 people
 
05:05:46.550 --> 05:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
it is the most polite
 
05:05:46.560 --> 05:05:48.230 align:start position:0%
it is the most polite
well-articulated

05:05:48.230 --> 05:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
well-articulated
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
day you will ever see
 
05:05:53.030 --> 05:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
everybody there is a very very nice i

anything

05:05:57.590 --> 05:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:05:57.600 --> 05:05:58.470 align:start position:0%
anything
so

05:05:58.470 --> 05:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:06:01.350 --> 05:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is
 
05:06:03.910 --> 05:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
for myself
 
05:06:05.910 --> 05:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know when you walk down a hall and
 
05:06:08.948 --> 05:06:08.958 align:start position:0%
it's just you and one other person
 
05:06:11.830 --> 05:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
and one of you has to move
 
05:06:14.310 --> 05:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
so that the other one can get by
 
05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
why is it that we're the ones that
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
always have to move
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
why do we have to give up our freedom
 
05:06:22.510 --> 05:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
and our right for somebody
 
05:06:26.150 --> 05:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
else i just doesn't make sense
 
05:06:28.788 --> 05:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
i'll end with this
 
05:06:30.230 --> 05:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
article two of the new hampshire
 
05:06:30.240 --> 05:06:32.310 align:start position:0%
article two of the new hampshire
constitution

05:06:32.310 --> 05:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
the bearing of arms all persons have the
 
05:06:38.550 --> 05:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
right to keep and bear arms in defense
 
05:06:40.868 --> 05:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
of themselves their families their
 
05:06:43.990 --> 05:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
property and the state
 
05:06:47.110 --> 05:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
this is not location specific
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and i'll take
 
05:06:51.830 --> 05:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:06:53.430 --> 05:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
bradley you're recognized for a question
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
05:06:56.390 --> 05:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:06:59.670 --> 05:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that
 
05:07:03.270 --> 05:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
you want your rights as a gun owner
 
05:07:05.350 --> 05:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
to supersede
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
my rights if i attended an event to not
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
have guns present
 
05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:15.030 --> 05:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
you all have to move over
 
05:07:16.788 --> 05:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
and make way for us
 
05:07:17.910 --> 05:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't sound like that's what
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do it sounds like the
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:28.310 --> 05:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that i have
 
05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
an inherent right as a human being to be
 
05:07:35.030 --> 05:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
able to protect myself
 
05:07:37.830 --> 05:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
what other folks want to do or not do is
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
up to them
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
but i should not be
 
05:07:43.910 --> 05:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
barred from the state
 
05:07:46.070 --> 05:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
to carry any place i have a legal right
 
05:07:47.990 --> 05:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:07:49.430 --> 05:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
represented bradley recognized for a
 
05:07:52.868 --> 05:07:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:55.430 --> 05:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
so do i have the right to attend an
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
event without guns present given that
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
this bill itself says that if you want
 
05:08:02.788 --> 05:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
to have a rally
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
a second amendment rally you're able to
 
05:08:06.550 --> 05:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
do that so if i wanted to go to the
 
05:08:08.310 --> 05:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
library with my children and have like a
 
05:08:09.990 --> 05:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
little rally outside saying we want
 
05:08:12.070 --> 05:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
books here do you think it's okay for me
 
05:08:13.670 --> 05:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to go there
 
05:08:16.310 --> 05:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
without the presence of guns
 
05:08:18.788 --> 05:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
or do you still think
 
05:08:21.670 --> 05:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
that your right to carry arms supersedes
 
05:08:23.670 --> 05:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
my right
 
05:08:26.310 --> 05:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
to not want them there
 
05:08:28.708 --> 05:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
if you want to go someplace
 
05:08:33.910 --> 05:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
and you want to
 
05:08:35.350 --> 05:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
i believe what you're saying is it would
 
05:08:37.830 --> 05:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
be akin to me basically going into your
 
05:08:39.750 --> 05:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
home if you don't want something in your
 
05:08:41.910 --> 05:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
home then that's fine if you want to go
 
05:08:44.788 --> 05:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
to a library event and you have it
 
05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
pre-ordained that there's not going to
 
05:08:47.830 --> 05:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
be anything there that's fine that's up
 
05:08:48.628 --> 05:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
to you
 
05:08:48.638 --> 05:08:49.510 align:start position:0%
to you
but

05:08:49.510 --> 05:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:08:52.550 --> 05:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
it if i'm going to go anywhere on earth
 
05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
i have the right to defend myself and
 
05:08:56.390 --> 05:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
all kidding aside on this one
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be in a spot
 
05:09:02.480 --> 05:09:03.510 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be in a spot
where

05:09:03.510 --> 05:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:09:07.350 --> 05:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
potentially something bad can happen
 
05:09:09.590 --> 05:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to subject
 
05:09:09.600 --> 05:09:11.590 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to subject
you

05:09:11.590 --> 05:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
or the gentleman in front here or the
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
people here to that danger if there's an
 
05:09:19.350 --> 05:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
option to stop that danger
 
05:09:21.030 --> 05:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
why would i not
 
05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:27.830 --> 05:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
so an answer to your question it's not a
 
05:09:30.070 --> 05:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
chance to make somebody else not do
 
05:09:30.080 --> 05:09:31.830 align:start position:0%
chance to make somebody else not do
something

05:09:31.830 --> 05:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:09:33.670 --> 05:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
your safety
 
05:09:33.680 --> 05:09:34.708 align:start position:0%
your safety
isn't

05:09:34.708 --> 05:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:43.270 --> 05:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
05:09:44.550 --> 05:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:09:45.830 --> 05:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:09:47.670 --> 05:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
um and you can answer this if you're
 
05:09:49.190 --> 05:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
aware of it or not
 
05:09:49.200 --> 05:09:50.070 align:start position:0%
aware of it or not
um

05:09:50.070 --> 05:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:52.470 --> 05:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
because i'm not um could you tell me
 
05:09:54.550 --> 05:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
where in new hampshire or the united
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
states constitution that it mentions
 
05:09:59.110 --> 05:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
baseball bats
 
05:10:01.750 --> 05:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
it does not as far as i'm aware oh thank
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
05:10:08.230 --> 05:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:09.110 --> 05:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
05:10:10.868 --> 05:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you mr chairman and
 
05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members of the
 
05:10:12.160 --> 05:10:14.070 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members of the
committee

05:10:14.070 --> 05:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:10:16.628 --> 05:10:16.638 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls joe hannon
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:25.110 --> 05:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for hearing me
 
05:10:26.470 --> 05:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
again my name is joe hennen from gun
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
owners of new hampshire
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:35.190 --> 05:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
we don't think that
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening should be allowed
 
05:10:39.590 --> 05:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
it should obviously be prosecuted but
 
05:10:41.350 --> 05:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
just the mere presence of an inanimate
 
05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
object is not threatening and it
 
05:10:44.390 --> 05:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be considered criminal
 
05:10:47.190 --> 05:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
activity we heard someone earlier say
 
05:10:49.350 --> 05:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
that this is intimidation
 
05:10:50.788 --> 05:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
and also right after that they said
 
05:10:53.990 --> 05:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
people are expressive and guns are not
 
05:10:56.310 --> 05:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
well they're not and we can't say that
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
if they're not expressive we're going to
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
consider just the mere presence of one
 
05:11:02.948 --> 05:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
being a crime
 
05:11:04.310 --> 05:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to have one according to
 
05:11:05.590 --> 05:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
this bill so it's okay to have as many
 
05:11:07.190 --> 05:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
as you want inside your code inside your
 
05:11:07.200 --> 05:11:08.628 align:start position:0%
as you want inside your code inside your
pants

05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
pants
 
05:11:10.868 --> 05:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure what the purpose is
 
05:11:13.750 --> 05:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
other if unless i'm not questioning the
 
05:11:14.948 --> 05:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
the motives of the bill but i don't
 
05:11:17.510 --> 05:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
understand why
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
banning just the presence of a gun
 
05:11:22.150 --> 05:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
would influence the person who's holding
 
05:11:24.868 --> 05:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
the firearm or other weapon in any way
 
05:11:26.708 --> 05:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
unless they're worried about i'm not
 
05:11:29.350 --> 05:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
sure if people are worried about being
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
starting a confrontation and people
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
don't like someone like we heard
 
05:11:35.270 --> 05:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
reference to the incident in wisconsin
 
05:11:36.868 --> 05:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
you know whether that individual had a
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
firearm concealed or not would have made
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
a difference we don't know but the fact
 
05:11:41.280 --> 05:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
a difference we don't know but the fact
is

05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:11:42.000 --> 05:11:43.270 align:start position:0%
is
that

05:11:43.270 --> 05:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:45.190 --> 05:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
that person had a firearm and used it to
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
defend themselves and was acquitted in
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
court under self-defense
 
05:11:49.680 --> 05:11:50.708 align:start position:0%
court under self-defense
so

05:11:50.708 --> 05:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:11:52.550 --> 05:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
i'm also not really sure whether we can
 
05:11:52.560 --> 05:11:53.910 align:start position:0%
i'm also not really sure whether we can
differentiate

05:11:53.910 --> 05:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
differentiate
 
05:11:53.920 --> 05:11:55.110 align:start position:0%
differentiate
what

05:11:55.110 --> 05:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:11:58.150 --> 05:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
a true riot is versus a political
 
05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
event or protest so when do we draw the
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
line there's nothing in here that says
 
05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay this protest is now in a hand it's
 
05:12:04.628 --> 05:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
not a riot so you you could have your
 
05:12:07.670 --> 05:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
firearm uh people may recall and a long
 
05:12:09.510 --> 05:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
time ago not some of the younger ones
 
05:12:11.270 --> 05:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
won't remember but 92 and the la riots
 
05:12:13.030 --> 05:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
there were korean store owners who were
 
05:12:15.030 --> 05:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
on their rooftops with with rifles to
 
05:12:16.628 --> 05:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
keep their their stores from burning
 
05:12:16.638 --> 05:12:17.350 align:start position:0%
keep their their stores from burning
down

05:12:17.350 --> 05:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:12:18.788 --> 05:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
now there was they were eventually
 
05:12:20.948 --> 05:12:20.958 align:start position:0%
declared riots during that period but
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
initially there were protests
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know when do you draw the line
 
05:12:27.110 --> 05:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
the pickup truck was a good example i do
 
05:12:29.190 --> 05:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
want to say that there are many ways of
 
05:12:31.030 --> 05:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
other vehicles that can have racks or a
 
05:12:32.390 --> 05:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
system of holding a
 
05:12:34.868 --> 05:12:34.878 align:start position:0%
firearm most police cars
 
05:12:37.350 --> 05:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
are sedans or something similar and they
 
05:12:39.350 --> 05:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
have a shotgun rack or other gun racks
 
05:12:41.350 --> 05:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
in the front seat or even on the back
 
05:12:43.030 --> 05:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon i've seen a prius with
 
05:12:44.868 --> 05:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
a gun wreck so
 
05:12:46.708 --> 05:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
you know it could be anything
 
05:12:46.718 --> 05:12:48.310 align:start position:0%
you know it could be anything
um

05:12:48.310 --> 05:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:49.750 --> 05:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
this it says this shall not apply to
 
05:12:50.948 --> 05:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement officers
 
05:12:53.670 --> 05:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
sheriffs police officers or other duly
 
05:12:55.990 --> 05:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
appointed peace law enforcement officers
 
05:12:57.750 --> 05:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
went on duty
 
05:12:58.868 --> 05:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure if that means that
 
05:13:00.070 --> 05:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
if they're off duty that a police
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
officer is not allowed to carry a
 
05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
firearm even though they are allowed to
 
05:13:02.878 --> 05:13:03.830 align:start position:0%
firearm even though they are allowed to
carry

05:13:03.830 --> 05:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
carry
 
05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
net with national reciprocity if they
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
meet requirements while off duty so if
 
05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
they're off duty does that not apply to
 
05:13:09.280 --> 05:13:10.550 align:start position:0%
they're off duty does that not apply to
them

05:13:10.550 --> 05:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
it also says that
 
05:13:14.390 --> 05:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
the regular and ordinary transportation
 
05:13:17.830 --> 05:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
epistles or revolvers as merchandise
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
05:13:21.030 --> 05:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
does not apply here so what does that
 
05:13:22.948 --> 05:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
mean does it mean if you just bought it
 
05:13:25.030 --> 05:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's okay but if you bought it a month
 
05:13:27.270 --> 05:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
ago and it's still in your car you
 
05:13:29.110 --> 05:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
brought it with you put on your seat or
 
05:13:31.190 --> 05:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
in a holster near your dash then you
 
05:13:33.190 --> 05:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of the law
 
05:13:35.030 --> 05:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
also there's no exception for being
 
05:13:36.868 --> 05:13:36.878 align:start position:0%
within 100 feet
 
05:13:39.350 --> 05:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
of a protest if you're in your car and
 
05:13:41.190 --> 05:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
you're at a stoplight or if you turn a
 
05:13:42.628 --> 05:13:42.638 align:start position:0%
corner in a city and they just happen to
 
05:13:43.910 --> 05:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
be protesting on the other side of the
 
05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
corner and you didn't know it was there
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
um you know you can be surprised and you
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
would be in
 
05:13:54.550 --> 05:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
i i heard references to you know uh
 
05:13:57.670 --> 05:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
different things that could be
 
05:13:59.190 --> 05:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
considered offensive
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know just because something's
 
05:14:02.550 --> 05:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
offensive doesn't mean it needs to be
 
05:14:03.750 --> 05:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
against the law i don't think we should
 
05:14:05.190 --> 05:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
amend this to add fist bumps is
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
something that shouldn't be allowed with
 
05:14:07.910 --> 05:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
public officials at a at a public
 
05:14:09.270 --> 05:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
gathering i mean that's you have a
 
05:14:10.550 --> 05:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
problem with that take it up with the
 
05:14:10.560 --> 05:14:12.230 align:start position:0%
problem with that take it up with the
department

05:14:12.230 --> 05:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:14:14.230 --> 05:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
um and how do we ban
 
05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
threatening images
 
05:14:18.470 --> 05:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
if you have a group of people who are
 
05:14:20.070 --> 05:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
maybe not as big as another group if one
 
05:14:21.510 --> 05:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
group just happens to be bigger that
 
05:14:23.590 --> 05:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
could be threatening to some you know do
 
05:14:25.510 --> 05:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
you say well we can't have a disparity
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
of size differences or age differences
 
05:14:29.270 --> 05:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
if you have a group of elderly people
 
05:14:31.990 --> 05:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
protesting you know do you not little
 
05:14:33.750 --> 05:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
but you know what if there's and this is
 
05:14:35.190 --> 05:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
purely ridiculous but what if you have
 
05:14:37.030 --> 05:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
some other group that is uh you know
 
05:14:39.430 --> 05:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
larger or stronger seeming showing up do
 
05:14:41.190 --> 05:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
you want is that not scary to that
 
05:14:42.948 --> 05:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
individual or that group it may be but
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to make something
 
05:14:46.150 --> 05:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
illegal because of someone's perceived
 
05:14:46.160 --> 05:14:47.350 align:start position:0%
illegal because of someone's perceived
differences

05:14:47.350 --> 05:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
differences
 
05:14:49.110 --> 05:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
and and the bottom line is if you can
 
05:14:50.788 --> 05:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
carry concealed at a protest or a
 
05:14:52.708 --> 05:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
funeral or anywhere else you've got the
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
weapon on you if someone's angering you
 
05:14:56.070 --> 05:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
so much that you're going to shoot and
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
kill them you already have the means to
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
do that it seems that this is more
 
05:15:01.350 --> 05:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
likely to stop someone else from
 
05:15:03.510 --> 05:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
provoking someone with a firearm which i
 
05:15:05.430 --> 05:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
do understand so do we want to make
 
05:15:07.110 --> 05:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
poking poking the bear so to speak
 
05:15:08.948 --> 05:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
against the law
 
05:15:10.708 --> 05:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
it's not a good idea i don't recommend
 
05:15:13.110 --> 05:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
it but people do have a right to defend
 
05:15:14.390 --> 05:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
themselves whether it's openly or
 
05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
concealed carry i don't think we need to
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
have laws that deal with just pure
 
05:15:20.550 --> 05:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
emotions and not facts criminal
 
05:15:22.150 --> 05:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
threatening should be prosecuted and the
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
mere presence of an object is not
 
05:15:25.990 --> 05:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
threatening nor criminal so i please ask
 
05:15:32.708 --> 05:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:35.350 --> 05:15:35.360 align:start position:0%

05:17:14.868 --> 05:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
ask the members of the public
 
05:17:16.470 --> 05:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
testifying with their testifying
 
05:17:16.480 --> 05:17:17.510 align:start position:0%
testifying with their testifying
individual

05:17:17.510 --> 05:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
individual
 
05:17:18.868 --> 05:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
individually or on behalf of an
 
05:17:21.030 --> 05:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
organization is for information relating
 
05:17:23.030 --> 05:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
05:17:27.430 --> 05:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.628 --> 05:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:36.868 --> 05:17:36.878 align:start position:0%
but you were recognized for follow-up
 
05:17:38.948 --> 05:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
well there's no need for it because i do
 
05:17:40.470 --> 05:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
know that he understands what i'm saying
 
05:17:40.480 --> 05:17:41.190 align:start position:0%
know that he understands what i'm saying
so

05:17:41.190 --> 05:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:17:43.190 --> 05:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to drop it at this point
 
05:17:43.200 --> 05:17:46.470 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to drop it at this point
um

05:17:46.470 --> 05:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:50.948 --> 05:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
point of order mr speaker or mr chair
 
05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you
 
05:17:53.190 --> 05:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
recognized for your point of voted
 
05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
police state your point of order
 
05:17:57.510 --> 05:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
um i would argue that
 
05:17:59.350 --> 05:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
a representative from a certain
 
05:17:59.360 --> 05:18:00.788 align:start position:0%
a representative from a certain
affiliation

05:18:00.788 --> 05:18:00.798 align:start position:0%
affiliation
 
05:18:03.510 --> 05:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
has every right to be questioned on his
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
ties and credibility on a subject matter
 
05:18:08.550 --> 05:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
related to this and that
 
05:18:10.948 --> 05:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
representative harriet gathering be
 
05:18:12.230 --> 05:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
05:18:14.788 --> 05:18:14.798 align:start position:0%
address and get a clear answer for her
 
05:18:17.750 --> 05:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
05:18:17.760 --> 05:18:19.270 align:start position:0%
question thank you
well

05:18:19.270 --> 05:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:18:20.948 --> 05:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
two things number one your point of
 
05:18:21.990 --> 05:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
order is
 
05:18:23.910 --> 05:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
not right you needed to have raised it
 
05:18:25.990 --> 05:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
right when i made that statement but in
 
05:18:27.990 --> 05:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
respect to the member who i addressed
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
that comment to
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
um i don't believe i actually stopped or
 
05:18:32.948 --> 05:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
prohibited that member from asking the
 
05:18:34.948 --> 05:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
question i just it was getting close to
 
05:18:36.708 --> 05:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
that boundary line so i was just kind of
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
as a reminder
 
05:18:46.390 --> 05:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative kline do you have a
 
05:18:49.030 --> 05:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
question for the witness
 
05:18:50.708 --> 05:18:50.718 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a question
 
05:18:52.230 --> 05:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:55.750 --> 05:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much mr chair um i just one
 
05:18:58.868 --> 05:18:58.878 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering uh if
 
05:19:02.948 --> 05:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
if everybody's concerned is that they're
 
05:19:05.430 --> 05:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
so scared of the first amendment that
 
05:19:05.440 --> 05:19:06.310 align:start position:0%
so scared of the first amendment that
that

05:19:06.310 --> 05:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
will outweigh their right
 
05:19:10.550 --> 05:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
and they go right to a second amendment
 
05:19:11.750 --> 05:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
are they
 
05:19:13.910 --> 05:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
they can't control themselves when they
 
05:19:15.830 --> 05:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
listen to people's first amendments is
 
05:19:18.868 --> 05:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
this is this the concern so that we need
 
05:19:21.190 --> 05:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
to outweigh the first amendment by
 
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
pushing the second amendment for a
 
05:19:25.030 --> 05:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
peaceful protest
 
05:19:27.110 --> 05:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely not that they're both they're
 
05:19:29.270 --> 05:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
both vital and important and
 
05:19:30.628 --> 05:19:30.638 align:start position:0%
i was just
 
05:19:32.470 --> 05:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
i think i was just hypothesizing that
 
05:19:33.990 --> 05:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
maybe some people
 
05:19:35.670 --> 05:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
you know wanted this to protect
 
05:19:35.680 --> 05:19:36.788 align:start position:0%
you know wanted this to protect
themselves

05:19:36.788 --> 05:19:36.798 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:19:38.070 --> 05:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
because they can't control themselves
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
when they see a firearm not the other
 
05:19:41.670 --> 05:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
way around the person has a firearm has
 
05:19:43.590 --> 05:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
it whether it's open or concealed so
 
05:19:44.948 --> 05:19:44.958 align:start position:0%
they've got the gun
 
05:19:46.390 --> 05:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of them having the
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
ability to cause harm if they chose to
 
05:19:51.350 --> 05:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
they often choose not to unless they're
 
05:19:53.110 --> 05:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
in danger or being threatened or
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
physically indeed you know
 
05:19:54.240 --> 05:19:56.470 align:start position:0%
physically indeed you know
life-threatening

05:19:56.470 --> 05:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
life-threatening
 
05:19:59.110 --> 05:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
situations you recognize for a follow-up
 
05:20:01.110 --> 05:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
are you saying that people are so
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
threatened by first amendment rights
 
05:20:06.070 --> 05:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
that that is why they need to carry a
 
05:20:08.070 --> 05:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
gun around
 
05:20:10.070 --> 05:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're so threatened by the freedom of
 
05:20:12.788 --> 05:20:12.798 align:start position:0%
speech that they feel the need to carry
 
05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
a weapon
 
05:20:16.708 --> 05:20:16.718 align:start position:0%
why would i say that i
 
05:20:18.310 --> 05:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
i believe you just i don't want to
 
05:20:19.990 --> 05:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
debate i'm just i'm not sure i've ever
 
05:20:21.510 --> 05:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
even insinuated that i think they're
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
both equally important one does not
 
05:20:25.670 --> 05:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
override the other they're completely
 
05:20:27.190 --> 05:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
separate entities that shouldn't
 
05:20:29.110 --> 05:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
contradict each other in any situation
 
05:20:32.310 --> 05:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
especially in a bill like this
 
05:20:34.230 --> 05:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
i believe that you you're saying that
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
you represented representative knight
 
05:20:36.718 --> 05:20:39.750 align:start position:0%
you represented representative knight
cleric

05:20:39.750 --> 05:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:41.830 --> 05:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend and i'm going to
 
05:20:43.350 --> 05:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
instruct the witness ought to respond to
 
05:20:47.350 --> 05:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
that if you have a follow-up question
 
05:20:49.910 --> 05:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand and as you can
 
05:20:52.070 --> 05:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
tell i've been recognizing every member
 
05:20:53.670 --> 05:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
to speak that there's no need for
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
yelling out questions without being
 
05:20:54.958 --> 05:20:56.310 align:start position:0%
yelling out questions without being
recognized

05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:02.070 --> 05:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative conley you're recognized
 
05:21:03.750 --> 05:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
to ask a question thank you mr chairman
 
05:21:05.430 --> 05:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question so
 
05:21:07.430 --> 05:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
i think the premise of this bill
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
as i understand it is that the presence
 
05:21:12.310 --> 05:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
of a firearm could be used
 
05:21:15.030 --> 05:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
by bad actors to
 
05:21:18.230 --> 05:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
threaten implicitly other people
 
05:21:20.070 --> 05:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
we all everyone in this room knows what
 
05:21:22.390 --> 05:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
the law is on constitutional carry on
 
05:21:24.150 --> 05:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
open carry that's not i don't think for
 
05:21:26.230 --> 05:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
a debate here but how would a reasonable
 
05:21:29.110 --> 05:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
person or could a reasonable person
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
distinguish between
 
05:21:36.868 --> 05:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:38.788 --> 05:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
going beyond that right to use the
 
05:21:40.948 --> 05:21:40.958 align:start position:0%
presence of a firearm to threaten could
 
05:21:44.708 --> 05:21:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
perception is relative to any individual
 
05:21:48.628 --> 05:21:48.638 align:start position:0%
but that shouldn't be what we base law
 
05:21:48.638 --> 05:21:49.670 align:start position:0%
but that shouldn't be what we base law
on

05:21:49.670 --> 05:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:21:51.830 --> 05:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know if something's legal it's legal
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be illegal when someone
 
05:21:55.590 --> 05:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
chooses it not to be for their own
 
05:21:57.670 --> 05:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
political purposes say for example
 
05:21:59.910 --> 05:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's a protest interior specifically
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
does not allow counter protests or
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
protests that firearms within 100 feet
 
05:22:04.948 --> 05:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
of another protest
 
05:22:07.230 --> 05:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
well that doesn't preclude the
 
05:22:10.070 --> 05:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
non-lethal weapon or firearm owning
 
05:22:11.750 --> 05:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
group from having
 
05:22:13.750 --> 05:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
confrontations within 100 feet they can
 
05:22:15.270 --> 05:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
get closer and what do you have to keep
 
05:22:16.628 --> 05:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
backing up and backing up but all of a
 
05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
sudden your voice isn't heard
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
you can have one group
 
05:22:23.670 --> 05:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
use their first amendment as a cudgel
 
05:22:25.350 --> 05:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
against another person's first amendment
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
right and that's exactly what this kind
 
05:22:34.230 --> 05:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:35.430 --> 05:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the
 
05:22:41.430 --> 05:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:01.270 --> 05:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
05:23:04.868 --> 05:23:04.878 align:start position:0%
for the record
 
05:23:07.430 --> 05:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
my name is alan rice i am a resident of
 
05:23:08.948 --> 05:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
bedford new hampshire
 
05:23:10.628 --> 05:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
i'm here on behalf of gun owners of
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
america a national
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
organization with over 2 million members
 
05:23:17.270 --> 05:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
and supporters nationwide
 
05:23:19.350 --> 05:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
rather than read from my testimony which
 
05:23:21.110 --> 05:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
is intended to cover
 
05:23:22.548 --> 05:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
this bill and one that you're going to
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
hear later today i'd like to offer some
 
05:23:26.548 --> 05:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
remarks in response to what some of the
 
05:23:28.628 --> 05:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
sponsors had to say
 
05:23:30.548 --> 05:23:30.558 align:start position:0%
representative muse seems to be
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about weapons toting
 
05:23:32.160 --> 05:23:33.910 align:start position:0%
concerned about weapons toting
protesters

05:23:33.910 --> 05:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
protesters
 
05:23:36.070 --> 05:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
well people have been carrying firearms
 
05:23:37.830 --> 05:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire for somewhere around
 
05:23:39.670 --> 05:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
300 years
 
05:23:42.390 --> 05:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
and no one should have to forfeit their
 
05:23:44.310 --> 05:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
second amendment rights
 
05:23:47.910 --> 05:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
to exercise their first amendment rights
 
05:23:50.390 --> 05:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
because certain people are uncomfortable
 
05:23:52.150 --> 05:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
around guns
 
05:23:54.708 --> 05:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean everyone else
 
05:23:57.750 --> 05:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
loses their right to have a gun
 
05:24:00.548 --> 05:24:00.558 align:start position:0%
kenosha was mentioned
 
05:24:02.788 --> 05:24:02.798 align:start position:0%
the gentleman in kenosha the young adult
 
05:24:04.548 --> 05:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
was found not guilty
 
05:24:05.990 --> 05:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
that was actually a case that we
 
05:24:08.150 --> 05:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
reviewed extensively
 
05:24:09.910 --> 05:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're very involved in use of force
 
05:24:09.920 --> 05:24:12.390 align:start position:0%
we're very involved in use of force
issues

05:24:12.390 --> 05:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:13.990 --> 05:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
when the adult
 
05:24:16.310 --> 05:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
a physically large adult male started
 
05:24:18.708 --> 05:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
swinging his skateboard and using it as
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
a deadly weapon that skateboard was no
 
05:24:23.270 --> 05:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
longer a toy it was a deadly weapon and
 
05:24:25.190 --> 05:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
mr rittenhouse responded absolutely
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
appropriately and we're glad that the
 
05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
jury agreed with him
 
05:24:32.548 --> 05:24:32.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a long history of not
 
05:24:34.390 --> 05:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
making crimes
 
05:24:36.948 --> 05:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
out of carrying guns it's never been a
 
05:24:38.708 --> 05:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
crime to carry a gun in the open in new
 
05:24:40.310 --> 05:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire ever
 
05:24:43.430 --> 05:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
and since 2017 it's not been a crime to
 
05:24:45.350 --> 05:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
carry a gun concealed
 
05:24:48.310 --> 05:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
without a license
 
05:24:50.628 --> 05:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
i would say that this long 300-year
 
05:24:52.708 --> 05:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
track record shows that the majority of
 
05:24:52.718 --> 05:24:54.070 align:start position:0%
track record shows that the majority of
residents

05:24:54.070 --> 05:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
residents
 
05:24:55.510 --> 05:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
agree with that
 
05:24:57.670 --> 05:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
there's no clamor for change i would say
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
that the sponsors of this bill
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
are not only the outliers they're part
 
05:25:02.830 --> 05:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
of a tiny
 
05:25:06.788 --> 05:25:06.798 align:start position:0%
minority they mentioned seven states
 
05:25:08.788 --> 05:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
most of the seven states that prohibit
 
05:25:10.788 --> 05:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
the carrying of guns at parades and
 
05:25:12.548 --> 05:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
protests and funerals
 
05:25:14.948 --> 05:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
are in the deep south
 
05:25:17.110 --> 05:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
the deep south did not allow people to
 
05:25:20.548 --> 05:25:20.558 align:start position:0%
carry guns until the mid 1990s
 
05:25:22.230 --> 05:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
it was a lot of jim crow laws that had
 
05:25:24.150 --> 05:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
to be overturned there was a lot of
 
05:25:26.310 --> 05:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
legislative compromise and deal making
 
05:25:28.390 --> 05:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
and one of the deals that was made
 
05:25:28.400 --> 05:25:29.110 align:start position:0%
and one of the deals that was made
in

05:25:29.110 --> 05:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:25:31.430 --> 05:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
multiple states was off limits places
 
05:25:33.190 --> 05:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
for concealed carry
 
05:25:34.948 --> 05:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's concealed carry law
 
05:25:37.350 --> 05:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
predated most of the southern states by
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
about 70 years
 
05:25:42.070 --> 05:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
we've always carried firearms without
 
05:25:42.080 --> 05:25:43.270 align:start position:0%
we've always carried firearms without
restriction

05:25:43.270 --> 05:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
05:25:46.230 --> 05:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
these restrictions were concessions
 
05:25:48.070 --> 05:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
so people could get the ability to carry
 
05:25:50.230 --> 05:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
guns at least some of the time
 
05:25:51.750 --> 05:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire to adopt the
 
05:25:54.070 --> 05:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
provisions of house bill 1151 would
 
05:25:55.990 --> 05:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
actually be going backwards
 
05:25:58.070 --> 05:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
backwards in our history and i don't
 
05:25:59.350 --> 05:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
think anybody
 
05:26:03.190 --> 05:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
in this general court wants to do that
 
05:26:04.948 --> 05:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
i want to respond to representative all
 
05:26:06.948 --> 05:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
chiller and i've said this before in
 
05:26:10.150 --> 05:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
other hearings coercive control
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely nothing
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
that prevents a victim or someone who
 
05:26:16.548 --> 05:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
thinks she might be a victim from
 
05:26:20.230 --> 05:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
legally arming herself for self-defense
 
05:26:22.310 --> 05:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's not coercive control if someone's
 
05:26:24.150 --> 05:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
peacefully carrying a weapon
 
05:26:26.070 --> 05:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm peacefully carrying a weapon right
 
05:26:28.310 --> 05:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
now but because we're in this particular
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
room in this building i can't take my
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
coat off if we were in your committee
 
05:26:34.948 --> 05:26:34.958 align:start position:0%
room i would take my coat off to show
 
05:26:37.270 --> 05:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
that it's a normal activity for people
 
05:26:39.510 --> 05:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to do every day
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
people get dressed wallet car keys
 
05:26:43.830 --> 05:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
reading glasses gun
 
05:26:45.910 --> 05:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
knife it's just people go about their
 
05:26:48.628 --> 05:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
daily business it's perfectly normal
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're not seeking to normalize anything
 
05:26:53.110 --> 05:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's already normal
 
05:26:54.628 --> 05:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
we're seeking to persuade the
 
05:26:57.270 --> 05:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
legislature not to go backwards so i
 
05:26:58.470 --> 05:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with
 
05:27:00.470 --> 05:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative all chiller
 
05:27:02.070 --> 05:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i would ask this committee to vote
 
05:27:05.430 --> 05:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 1151 in expedient to
 
05:27:05.440 --> 05:27:10.230 align:start position:0%
house bill 1151 in expedient to
legislate

05:27:10.230 --> 05:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:12.948 --> 05:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative bert you're recognized
 
05:27:14.788 --> 05:27:14.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:27:16.150 --> 05:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
05:27:19.190 --> 05:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
if you look at page one of the bill and
 
05:27:22.628 --> 05:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
it's line 24 and 25
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
and let me read it to you
 
05:27:25.830 --> 05:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's very short
 
05:27:27.990 --> 05:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
this section shall also apply to a
 
05:27:31.590 --> 05:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
person in a private vehicle who is who
 
05:27:34.390 --> 05:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
are part or traveling that's the word i
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
like is traveling on a public property
 
05:27:38.470 --> 05:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
within a hundred feet
 
05:27:40.948 --> 05:27:40.958 align:start position:0%
of the closest event
 
05:27:44.708 --> 05:27:44.718 align:start position:0%
as i travel down a road how would i know
 
05:27:47.510 --> 05:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
that there's an event coming up
 
05:27:49.830 --> 05:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
and what would i do with my firearm at
 
05:27:52.548 --> 05:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
that point would i have to stop and turn
 
05:27:54.708 --> 05:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
around or you know how would i handle
 
05:27:56.310 --> 05:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
that situation
 
05:27:58.628 --> 05:27:58.638 align:start position:0%
oh representative i appreciate that
 
05:27:58.638 --> 05:28:00.708 align:start position:0%
oh representative i appreciate that
question

05:28:00.708 --> 05:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:28:03.990 --> 05:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
this is a very serious section because
 
05:28:06.390 --> 05:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
cars are mobile and i've seen a lot of
 
05:28:08.868 --> 05:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
protests in parades that are mobile
 
05:28:10.628 --> 05:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
and when the two come upon one another
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
the person with a openly carried firearm
 
05:28:14.548 --> 05:28:14.558 align:start position:0%
in a vehicle
 
05:28:16.390 --> 05:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of this they could
 
05:28:18.548 --> 05:28:18.558 align:start position:0%
face arrest and jail time
 
05:28:21.350 --> 05:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
for what for having a gun and not using
 
05:28:23.910 --> 05:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
it and not harming anyone
 
05:28:26.708 --> 05:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
it's kind of absurd on its face but i
 
05:28:28.070 --> 05:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
05:28:29.910 --> 05:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
those two lines
 
05:28:32.150 --> 05:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
um clearly show the intentions of the
 
05:28:32.160 --> 05:28:33.270 align:start position:0%
um clearly show the intentions of the
sponsors

05:28:33.270 --> 05:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
sponsors
 
05:28:34.708 --> 05:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
which is to
 
05:28:37.350 --> 05:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
delegitimize firearms stigmatize those
 
05:28:39.590 --> 05:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
who use them and ultimately ban their
 
05:28:42.470 --> 05:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
ownership and use throughout our state
 
05:28:46.708 --> 05:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:48.150 --> 05:28:48.160 align:start position:0%

05:28:48.160 --> 05:28:49.590 align:start position:0%

my question are you saying your right to
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
have a gun at a peaceful protest
 
05:28:57.750 --> 05:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
outweighs the safety of the people
 
05:29:01.270 --> 05:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:04.390 --> 05:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
my right to have a gun
 
05:29:06.548 --> 05:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
is my right to have a gun
 
05:29:09.430 --> 05:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
my right and the practice of carrying a
 
05:29:09.440 --> 05:29:10.310 align:start position:0%
my right and the practice of carrying a
gun

05:29:10.310 --> 05:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
gun
 
05:29:12.948 --> 05:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
does not put anyone in any danger other
 
05:29:15.430 --> 05:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
than the person who might try to harm me
 
05:29:16.788 --> 05:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
i'm carrying a gun right now
 
05:29:18.948 --> 05:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
representative do you feel unsafe i
 
05:29:20.470 --> 05:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
haven't made any threatening movements
 
05:29:22.788 --> 05:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
and i have no plans to do so
 
05:29:24.230 --> 05:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you there's many other
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
people in this room carrying firearms
 
05:29:29.510 --> 05:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make anyone unsafe to the
 
05:29:37.750 --> 05:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:39.510 --> 05:29:39.520 align:start position:0%

05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:29:55.510 --> 05:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
you heard in testimony that
 
05:29:56.788 --> 05:29:56.798 align:start position:0%
gun owners of new hampshire is
 
05:29:59.990 --> 05:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated with gun owners of america
 
05:30:02.788 --> 05:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
are you aware that the gun owners of new
 
05:30:05.750 --> 05:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire's testimony sheet has uh gun
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
owners of america on it
 
05:30:10.390 --> 05:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
i i haven't seen it i'm sure dr hannan
 
05:30:13.670 --> 05:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:16.708 --> 05:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
but i haven't seen it
 
05:30:17.670 --> 05:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:30:21.030 --> 05:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:22.788 --> 05:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the witness
 
05:30:25.750 --> 05:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:35.910 --> 05:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:37.270 --> 05:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
05:30:39.030 --> 05:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
committee members for allowing me to
 
05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
speak i've heard a lot of talk today
 
05:30:44.230 --> 05:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
well actually i want to start with i
 
05:30:45.910 --> 05:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
want to start with dispelling some
 
05:30:49.350 --> 05:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
misnomer i was one of those protesters
 
05:30:51.590 --> 05:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
at the governor's house
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
i did see over 20 weapons visibly
 
05:30:57.430 --> 05:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
available uh readily available but i did
 
05:31:00.628 --> 05:31:00.638 align:start position:0%
not see one of those weapons unless on
 
05:31:03.270 --> 05:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
the less than 10 protesters all of those
 
05:31:06.708 --> 05:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
weapons over 20 of them were on the on
 
05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
the hips of the police officers
 
05:31:12.390 --> 05:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to dispel that rumor
 
05:31:15.110 --> 05:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
and i really appreciate being able to
 
05:31:17.830 --> 05:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
have the venue to finally clear that up
 
05:31:19.830 --> 05:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
um i heard a lot of talk today about
 
05:31:21.430 --> 05:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
that four letter word
 
05:31:24.150 --> 05:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
four-letter word that that is i'm
 
05:31:26.390 --> 05:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
hearing more and more and more since
 
05:31:28.628 --> 05:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
covert 19 fear
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is is if a bill like
 
05:31:33.590 --> 05:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
this were to pass
 
05:31:35.030 --> 05:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
then we
 
05:31:38.310 --> 05:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
are opening opening ourselves up for
 
05:31:40.708 --> 05:31:40.718 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness they're not wearing a
 
05:31:43.590 --> 05:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
mask we must be afraid
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
they're not they don't have a vaccine
 
05:31:47.910 --> 05:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
passport we must be afraid
 
05:31:50.070 --> 05:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
it is not fair or appropriate to
 
05:31:51.750 --> 05:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
identify people
 
05:31:51.760 --> 05:31:52.470 align:start position:0%
identify people
for

05:31:52.470 --> 05:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:31:55.430 --> 05:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
who they are or what they represent
 
05:31:58.470 --> 05:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
based on the color of their skin the way
 
05:32:00.470 --> 05:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
they choose to carry a weapon or not
 
05:32:02.788 --> 05:32:02.798 align:start position:0%
choose a carrier weapon their sex their
 
05:32:04.788 --> 05:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
political affiliation their religious
 
05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
affiliation or their or their um vaccine
 
05:32:09.670 --> 05:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine status
 
05:32:11.830 --> 05:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
and the bottom line here is i have
 
05:32:14.230 --> 05:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
listened to a lot of representatives
 
05:32:16.470 --> 05:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
talk about they want vaccine mandates
 
05:32:18.628 --> 05:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
they want mass mandates and then they
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
turn around and they come in here and
 
05:32:22.628 --> 05:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
they try to take our second amendment
 
05:32:24.548 --> 05:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
rights away
 
05:32:28.070 --> 05:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
i think that is a problem thank you and
 
05:32:32.150 --> 05:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:33.910 --> 05:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the witness
 
05:32:36.070 --> 05:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
is excused
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls lauren lepage
 
05:32:38.958 --> 05:32:44.628 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls lauren lepage
association

05:32:44.628 --> 05:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:46.708 --> 05:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon once again my name is
 
05:32:49.270 --> 05:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
lauren lepage i'm from sanford maine
 
05:32:50.708 --> 05:32:50.718 align:start position:0%
i'm here as the state director for the
 
05:32:52.310 --> 05:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
national rifle association in new
 
05:32:52.320 --> 05:32:53.830 align:start position:0%
national rifle association in new
hampshire

05:32:53.830 --> 05:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
i will submit a letter electronically to
 
05:32:57.510 --> 05:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
the committee covering both this and the
 
05:33:00.150 --> 05:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
following bill because our rationale in
 
05:33:02.230 --> 05:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
for opposition is largely based on the
 
05:33:02.240 --> 05:33:03.190 align:start position:0%
for opposition is largely based on the
same

05:33:03.190 --> 05:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
same
 
05:33:05.430 --> 05:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
rationale so i'll save you from having
 
05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
to hear from me twice
 
05:33:07.200 --> 05:33:08.708 align:start position:0%
to hear from me twice
um

05:33:08.708 --> 05:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:10.230 --> 05:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
i think joe i think alan i think
 
05:33:12.070 --> 05:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
everyone has summed it up
 
05:33:15.430 --> 05:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
simply open carrying a firearm
 
05:33:16.548 --> 05:33:16.558 align:start position:0%
should not be something that's made
 
05:33:17.990 --> 05:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
illegal i do want to talk about the
 
05:33:20.708 --> 05:33:20.718 align:start position:0%
mechanics of enforcement of the bill
 
05:33:22.548 --> 05:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be difficult to sort of
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
hypothetically assume
 
05:33:27.350 --> 05:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
that a parade is moving and so people
 
05:33:29.190 --> 05:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
are going to be moving in and out of
 
05:33:32.470 --> 05:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
that 100 foot buffer zone as the parade
 
05:33:35.510 --> 05:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
is moving in a public way
 
05:33:37.590 --> 05:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
that could result in someone who was law
 
05:33:37.600 --> 05:33:38.708 align:start position:0%
that could result in someone who was law
abiding

05:33:38.708 --> 05:33:38.718 align:start position:0%
abiding
 
05:33:40.390 --> 05:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
not a spectator of the event not
 
05:33:42.310 --> 05:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
participating in a counter protest
 
05:33:44.150 --> 05:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
potentially getting hung up in the
 
05:33:45.510 --> 05:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
system while they were having a
 
05:33:46.948 --> 05:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
conversation with their neighbor on the
 
05:33:48.628 --> 05:33:48.638 align:start position:0%
sidewalk simply because they were open
 
05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
carrying a firearm
 
05:33:53.510 --> 05:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
another thing is with a blazer
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
if my blazer accidentally gets stuck and
 
05:33:58.548 --> 05:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
my firearm becomes visible despite the
 
05:34:00.150 --> 05:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
fact that i was attempting to carry
 
05:34:00.160 --> 05:34:01.430 align:start position:0%
fact that i was attempting to carry
concealed

05:34:01.430 --> 05:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
concealed
 
05:34:03.750 --> 05:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
does that entrap a law-abiding
 
05:34:06.310 --> 05:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
citizen who is lawfully carrying a
 
05:34:08.150 --> 05:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
firearm concealed
 
05:34:10.548 --> 05:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
so to not repeat all of the points that
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
had been made
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
those are some sort of the mechanical
 
05:34:15.750 --> 05:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill that we've seen
 
05:34:17.750 --> 05:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
um and like i said i will submit written
 
05:34:19.430 --> 05:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
testimony on both of these for the
 
05:34:21.590 --> 05:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee to consider
 
05:34:25.190 --> 05:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:34:29.350 --> 05:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
the witness is excused
 
05:34:38.548 --> 05:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:40.628 --> 05:34:40.638 align:start position:0%
my name is penny dean i'm a resident of
 
05:34:42.470 --> 05:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
concord new hampshire
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
and i would ask that this bill be itl
 
05:34:47.030 --> 05:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
for many many reasons
 
05:34:49.110 --> 05:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
and it's not because i want to sell guns
 
05:34:50.548 --> 05:34:50.558 align:start position:0%
i don't sell guns for a living so i'm
 
05:34:53.110 --> 05:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
not here to sell guns i'd like to buy
 
05:34:55.750 --> 05:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
guns more guns but not sell
 
05:34:58.150 --> 05:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
next i think again we need to go back to
 
05:35:01.270 --> 05:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
the dictionary it's a very basic tool
 
05:35:03.750 --> 05:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
the term coercive control
 
05:35:06.470 --> 05:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
has been used repeatedly if one looks to
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
the dictionary in the history
 
05:35:11.750 --> 05:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's defined as harm punishment and
 
05:35:11.760 --> 05:35:13.110 align:start position:0%
it's defined as harm punishment and
threaten

05:35:13.110 --> 05:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
threaten
 
05:35:16.470 --> 05:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
is designed to harm punish and threaten
 
05:35:16.480 --> 05:35:17.670 align:start position:0%
is designed to harm punish and threaten
anyone

05:35:17.670 --> 05:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
05:35:19.510 --> 05:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think anyone can make a
 
05:35:21.750 --> 05:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable argument that those who are
 
05:35:24.150 --> 05:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
carrying open firearms are trying to
 
05:35:27.590 --> 05:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
harm punish or threaten another person
 
05:35:29.350 --> 05:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
because if they are we've got plenty of
 
05:35:31.270 --> 05:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
laws to take care of them
 
05:35:34.868 --> 05:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
but i think what's important and i think
 
05:35:37.510 --> 05:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
you have to look at this
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
a person who doesn't carry a gun i find
 
05:35:40.320 --> 05:35:42.070 align:start position:0%
a person who doesn't carry a gun i find
strange

05:35:42.070 --> 05:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
strange
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
because carrying a gun if there's a
 
05:35:46.548 --> 05:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
message that you're carrying openly
 
05:35:48.548 --> 05:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
sends i'll tell you what message i'm
 
05:35:51.510 --> 05:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
sending that i am responsible for my own
 
05:35:54.150 --> 05:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
personal safety i don't expect anyone
 
05:35:56.868 --> 05:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
else to buy my groceries i have a job i
 
05:35:59.190 --> 05:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
make money i don't expect anyone to pay
 
05:36:01.030 --> 05:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
my rent if you will in my light and my
 
05:36:03.510 --> 05:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
phone and i'm willing to take personal
 
05:36:06.070 --> 05:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility for my own well-being
 
05:36:08.150 --> 05:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
that means my own physical well-being
 
05:36:09.910 --> 05:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
and you sometimes show that by open
 
05:36:11.510 --> 05:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
caring i'm willing to take personal
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility for protecting my family
 
05:36:15.030 --> 05:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
and friends
 
05:36:16.390 --> 05:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
and if anything
 
05:36:18.788 --> 05:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
that's what open carrying a gun is meant
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:36:20.400 --> 05:36:21.510 align:start position:0%
to do
but

05:36:21.510 --> 05:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
firearms are tools and they break
 
05:36:26.390 --> 05:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
anybody who's carried a firearm even the
 
05:36:28.628 --> 05:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
best brand new firearms by the maker of
 
05:36:31.350 --> 05:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
your choice they jam and they break
 
05:36:33.830 --> 05:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
so most people consider carrying two
 
05:36:33.840 --> 05:36:35.350 align:start position:0%
so most people consider carrying two
firearms

05:36:35.350 --> 05:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
firearms
 
05:36:37.830 --> 05:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
because one gun is really no gun and two
 
05:36:39.590 --> 05:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
gun is one gun
 
05:36:41.830 --> 05:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
and one just has to pay attention to the
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
local paper
 
05:36:44.948 --> 05:36:44.958 align:start position:0%
they've had brand new cigs from the
 
05:36:46.708 --> 05:36:46.718 align:start position:0%
state police they pull out to use in an
 
05:36:48.628 --> 05:36:48.638 align:start position:0%
emergency situation
 
05:36:50.948 --> 05:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
they don't go bank
 
05:36:53.110 --> 05:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
so it's not unreasonable to carry
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
multiple firearms
 
05:36:57.030 --> 05:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
but when you look at this bill
 
05:36:59.510 --> 05:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
i see this bill as being ripe for abuse
 
05:37:01.590 --> 05:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
you've got a couple problems whenever
 
05:37:03.670 --> 05:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
you have vague terms
 
05:37:05.350 --> 05:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
right for abuse
 
05:37:07.430 --> 05:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
how many people have heard about people
 
05:37:09.830 --> 05:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
getting swatted they call 9-1-1 and
 
05:37:13.270 --> 05:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
report some fake activity next door
 
05:37:15.030 --> 05:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
other people who don't like firearms
 
05:37:16.628 --> 05:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
have claimed people just who are
 
05:37:18.708 --> 05:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
carrying firearms have pointed a firearm
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
at them just to get them in trouble
 
05:37:24.868 --> 05:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
and so to answer representative bert's
 
05:37:27.510 --> 05:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
question unless these people are
 
05:37:29.590 --> 05:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
actually carrying your body
 
05:37:31.430 --> 05:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
i say the open carriers are subject to
 
05:37:33.670 --> 05:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
get arrested and unless you have like a
 
05:37:35.830 --> 05:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
50-foot coffin or something
 
05:37:37.510 --> 05:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have trouble the people
 
05:37:39.030 --> 05:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
attending your
 
05:37:41.590 --> 05:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
wake no guns for them or at least no
 
05:37:42.628 --> 05:37:42.638 align:start position:0%
open ones
 
05:37:44.310 --> 05:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
but i think you need to look
 
05:37:46.948 --> 05:37:46.958 align:start position:0%
specifically at the terms in this
 
05:37:50.150 --> 05:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
particular bill and i think you look at
 
05:37:52.628 --> 05:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
for example lawful marches what is a
 
05:37:54.390 --> 05:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
lawful march
 
05:37:56.230 --> 05:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know what a lawful march it's a
 
05:37:58.788 --> 05:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
lawful march i see someone open carrying
 
05:38:00.150 --> 05:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't like them all been carrying
 
05:38:02.070 --> 05:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
so me and my friend start marching we've
 
05:38:03.430 --> 05:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
got two of us we're having a lawful
 
05:38:03.440 --> 05:38:04.310 align:start position:0%
got two of us we're having a lawful
march

05:38:04.310 --> 05:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
march
 
05:38:06.310 --> 05:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
and we can then say to the police arrest
 
05:38:07.830 --> 05:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
these people they're within 100 foot of
 
05:38:11.190 --> 05:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
us and we're having a lawful march
 
05:38:14.230 --> 05:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
what's a vigil how many people have seen
 
05:38:16.390 --> 05:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
people who have died or been killed and
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
you see a bunch of flowers by the road
 
05:38:19.830 --> 05:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
or a bunch of flowers in town and
 
05:38:19.840 --> 05:38:21.190 align:start position:0%
or a bunch of flowers in town and
candles

05:38:21.190 --> 05:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
candles
 
05:38:24.150 --> 05:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
and they'll have a nightly news thing
 
05:38:26.628 --> 05:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
but is a vigil one person so if i'm
 
05:38:29.350 --> 05:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
really sad because someone died and they
 
05:38:30.948 --> 05:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
have the little flowers there and a
 
05:38:33.270 --> 05:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
picture of them and a candle
 
05:38:35.430 --> 05:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
i can have a vigil right
 
05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
that means this hundred foot perimeter
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
no bugarian
 
05:38:41.270 --> 05:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
and what if you just happen to be
 
05:38:43.590 --> 05:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
walking down the street again right for
 
05:38:47.110 --> 05:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
abuse these terms are not defined
 
05:38:49.190 --> 05:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
who's a spectator
 
05:38:52.708 --> 05:38:52.718 align:start position:0%
can i be a spectator of something that's
 
05:38:54.868 --> 05:38:54.878 align:start position:0%
good distance away that means i'm
 
05:38:56.948 --> 05:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
essentially a roving
 
05:38:59.030 --> 05:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
no open carry zone
 
05:39:01.270 --> 05:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
because i'm a spectator of that funeral
 
05:39:03.670 --> 05:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
going on over there
 
05:39:05.590 --> 05:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
so the thing is you've got to ask
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
yourself how could this be abused and i
 
05:39:10.470 --> 05:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
think it could be abused 10 ways to
 
05:39:10.480 --> 05:39:12.708 align:start position:0%
think it could be abused 10 ways to
sunday

05:39:12.708 --> 05:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
sunday
 
05:39:15.430 --> 05:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
and we look at this
 
05:39:17.990 --> 05:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
and we say
 
05:39:20.628 --> 05:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
impromptu counter protest counter
 
05:39:22.470 --> 05:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
rallies counter marches
 
05:39:24.788 --> 05:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
what in the world are those
 
05:39:27.510 --> 05:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer
 
05:39:27.520 --> 05:39:28.390 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer
but

05:39:28.390 --> 05:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:39:30.628 --> 05:39:30.638 align:start position:0%
you don't have a right
 
05:39:33.030 --> 05:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
not to have firearms around you i have a
 
05:39:34.310 --> 05:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
right to carry firearms it's in the
 
05:39:36.868 --> 05:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
constitution last time i read it
 
05:39:39.350 --> 05:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
but you can show me just because
 
05:39:42.150 --> 05:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm intimidated by men in red shirts
 
05:39:43.910 --> 05:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think representatives should get
 
05:39:45.430 --> 05:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
to wear red shirts because that that
 
05:39:48.310 --> 05:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
makes me feel uncomfortable
 
05:39:50.948 --> 05:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
i mean where do we go with this
 
05:39:52.788 --> 05:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is
 
05:39:54.788 --> 05:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
nobody is saying that the people who are
 
05:39:57.350 --> 05:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
carrying firearms openly are doing or
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
saying anything to make a reasonable
 
05:39:59.520 --> 05:40:00.470 align:start position:0%
saying anything to make a reasonable
person

05:40:00.470 --> 05:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:40:02.788 --> 05:40:02.798 align:start position:0%
feel afraid there's laws for that
 
05:40:05.190 --> 05:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking that this bill be itl for
 
05:40:08.708 --> 05:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
many many reasons not the least of which
 
05:40:11.190 --> 05:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
is quite frankly
 
05:40:12.548 --> 05:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
05:40:15.510 --> 05:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
a recipe for every anti-gunner in the
 
05:40:15.520 --> 05:40:16.548 align:start position:0%
a recipe for every anti-gunner in the
state

05:40:16.548 --> 05:40:16.558 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:40:19.510 --> 05:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
to intimidate and harass gun owners
 
05:40:21.590 --> 05:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
and if that was their intention this is
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
the beautiful piece of legislation
 
05:40:25.750 --> 05:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
because it's going to do that
 
05:40:27.628 --> 05:40:27.638 align:start position:0%
it's what every
 
05:40:31.350 --> 05:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
anti-firearm person could wish for
 
05:40:34.470 --> 05:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
because it's like trying to say you
 
05:40:36.470 --> 05:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
can't do anything within 150 feet of
 
05:40:36.480 --> 05:40:37.590 align:start position:0%
can't do anything within 150 feet of
anything

05:40:37.590 --> 05:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:40:39.030 --> 05:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
wherever you measure there's going to be
 
05:40:40.548 --> 05:40:40.558 align:start position:0%
a visual wherever you measure there's
 
05:40:42.310 --> 05:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
going to be a counter protest wherever
 
05:40:42.320 --> 05:40:43.830 align:start position:0%
going to be a counter protest wherever
you

05:40:43.830 --> 05:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:40:45.110 --> 05:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have no chance
 
05:40:46.390 --> 05:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's the other thing you're not going
 
05:40:47.830 --> 05:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
to have you're not going to know what
 
05:40:49.430 --> 05:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
hit you
 
05:40:51.350 --> 05:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to answer practical
 
05:40:55.190 --> 05:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
questions but as i look at this
 
05:40:56.788 --> 05:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
i don't think the other thing you might
 
05:40:58.948 --> 05:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
want to look at is all the terms defined
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
in 6 25 11. if you look at new hampshire
 
05:41:04.470 --> 05:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
rsa 625-11
 
05:41:06.310 --> 05:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
which is a statute that talks about how
 
05:41:08.788 --> 05:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
things are meant to be used
 
05:41:11.030 --> 05:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
if i'm wearing some big long sharp
 
05:41:12.628 --> 05:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
earrings that you say
 
05:41:14.230 --> 05:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
that i could use them to poke with you
 
05:41:14.240 --> 05:41:14.948 align:start position:0%
that i could use them to poke with you
with

05:41:14.948 --> 05:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
is that one of the things i can't carry
 
05:41:18.708 --> 05:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
i have some of those cool hair sticks
 
05:41:20.548 --> 05:41:20.558 align:start position:0%
that are pokey on the end
 
05:41:23.110 --> 05:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
one of you guys don't like hair sticks
 
05:41:25.190 --> 05:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
so i respectfully say this needs to be
 
05:41:30.230 --> 05:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
ideal for many many reasons
 
05:41:34.150 --> 05:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:41.750 --> 05:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:43.270 --> 05:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
at this time when i'll close the public
 
05:41:52.310 --> 05:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:52.320 --> 05:41:53.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:41:53.670 --> 05:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:41:56.628 --> 05:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
so this is a procedural
 
05:41:59.030 --> 05:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
and i mean no disrespect i actually
 
05:42:00.628 --> 05:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
once the
 
05:42:02.070 --> 05:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
gavel hits them
 
05:42:03.350 --> 05:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing's been closed like i don't
 
05:42:09.750 --> 05:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:11.270 --> 05:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
it was pretty close i was trying to hold
 
05:42:16.708 --> 05:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:18.310 --> 05:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i don't have one on this one in
 
05:42:20.070 --> 05:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
the water
 
05:42:21.910 --> 05:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
05:42:23.190 --> 05:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized for a

i thought that wasn't going on the
direction

05:42:40.628 --> 05:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
direction
 
05:42:42.708 --> 05:42:42.718 align:start position:0%

uh this was the one that i definitely
 
05:42:55.270 --> 05:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
came to speak for so thank you very much
 
05:42:58.310 --> 05:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate that um david leroux so
 
05:43:00.070 --> 05:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
where to start obviously this should be
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
in my opinion uh itld i guess is the
 
05:43:03.110 --> 05:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
term for it
 
05:43:04.708 --> 05:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
i want to read you a quote
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
we cannot but pity the boy who has never
 
05:43:09.510 --> 05:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
fired a gun he is no more humane
 
05:43:11.430 --> 05:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
while his education has been sadly
 
05:43:14.070 --> 05:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
neglected anybody recognize that henry
 
05:43:15.350 --> 05:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
david thoreau
 
05:43:17.590 --> 05:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
1846 walden
 
05:43:17.600 --> 05:43:18.470 align:start position:0%
1846 walden
okay

05:43:18.470 --> 05:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:43:20.788 --> 05:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
not wanting to use carry be involved
 
05:43:23.270 --> 05:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
with firearms does not make you a more
 
05:43:26.868 --> 05:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh humane ethical better person
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
okay we have heard lots of things based
 
05:43:31.110 --> 05:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
on feelings we have heard the arguments
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
about how a firearm makes somebody feel
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the bottom line is your feelings i
 
05:43:37.110 --> 05:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
don't believe their reference in the
 
05:43:39.750 --> 05:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
constitution but i'm not a scholar
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
what i do know is we have a second
 
05:43:42.868 --> 05:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
amendment now
 
05:43:44.628 --> 05:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
why have i not heard anybody talk about
 
05:43:47.110 --> 05:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
any actual data if we're looking for a
 
05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
safer society let me give you 2020 fbi
 
05:43:51.120 --> 05:43:52.548 align:start position:0%
safer society let me give you 2020 fbi
data

05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
data
 
05:43:55.030 --> 05:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
now if i said is vermont a very safe
 
05:43:57.110 --> 05:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
state most people would say yes but what
 
05:43:58.548 --> 05:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
if you feel like vermont is not safe
 
05:44:01.030 --> 05:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
enough for you you could move to idaho
 
05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
they are safer per the 2020 fbi data
 
05:44:05.830 --> 05:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
what if idaho is still too scary for
 
05:44:08.628 --> 05:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
your feelings well you may move to maine
 
05:44:10.708 --> 05:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
but what if maine is not good enough you
 
05:44:12.310 --> 05:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
may move to new hampshire because
 
05:44:15.510 --> 05:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
according to the 2020 fbi data
 
05:44:17.990 --> 05:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire ranks 50.
 
05:44:20.470 --> 05:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
we are the safest for murder
 
05:44:23.590 --> 05:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
we are 49 sadly for violent crime i know
 
05:44:25.670 --> 05:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's terrible but if more people carried
 
05:44:27.510 --> 05:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
firearms perhaps we could get to the
 
05:44:29.190 --> 05:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
bottom of the barrel for violent crime
 
05:44:31.270 --> 05:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
as well those are numbers those are not
 
05:44:31.280 --> 05:44:33.270 align:start position:0%
as well those are numbers those are not
feelings

05:44:33.270 --> 05:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
feelings
 
05:44:33.280 --> 05:44:34.230 align:start position:0%
feelings
now

05:44:34.230 --> 05:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:44:37.590 --> 05:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
i open carry i dislike concealed carry
 
05:44:39.590 --> 05:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
i have spent my whole life since i have
 
05:44:41.670 --> 05:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
been using firearms training with open
 
05:44:43.590 --> 05:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
carry i was trained in the us coast
 
05:44:45.110 --> 05:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
guard as what we call a boarding team
 
05:44:47.590 --> 05:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
member our equivalent of coast guard
 
05:44:49.430 --> 05:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
police as a federal law enforcement
 
05:44:49.440 --> 05:44:50.628 align:start position:0%
police as a federal law enforcement
officer

05:44:50.628 --> 05:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
officer
 
05:44:52.150 --> 05:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
to open carry
 
05:44:53.830 --> 05:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
cops open carry for a multiple of
 
05:44:57.270 --> 05:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
reasons and i can uh talk about that we
 
05:44:59.830 --> 05:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
have retention holsters it is at high a
 
05:45:02.230 --> 05:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
hotly contested point that a holster
 
05:45:04.310 --> 05:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
that is concealed typically does not
 
05:45:05.830 --> 05:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
have a method of retention so if
 
05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
somebody sees your firearm and wishes to
 
05:45:09.830 --> 05:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
take it from you they can now just draw
 
05:45:11.190 --> 05:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
that out because there is nothing in the
 
05:45:13.590 --> 05:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
holster to physically hang on to that
 
05:45:15.510 --> 05:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
typically most
 
05:45:17.830 --> 05:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
open carry outside the hip holsters that
 
05:45:19.910 --> 05:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
you would see on a pistol have a method
 
05:45:22.150 --> 05:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
of retention some of them two or three
 
05:45:23.830 --> 05:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's what's known as a triple retention
 
05:45:26.390 --> 05:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
holster so a bad actor which we are
 
05:45:28.230 --> 05:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
totally afraid of comes up to try to
 
05:45:30.230 --> 05:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
take your firearm they now have to fight
 
05:45:32.230 --> 05:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
to try to get the firearm not only from
 
05:45:34.708 --> 05:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
you someone who has professed the experi
 
05:45:36.470 --> 05:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
the expression that you are willing to
 
05:45:38.070 --> 05:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for your life
 
05:45:39.670 --> 05:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
because when seconds count the cops are
 
05:45:42.070 --> 05:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
only minutes away and it has been shown
 
05:45:43.750 --> 05:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
that the police are not obligated to put
 
05:45:45.910 --> 05:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
themselves in harm's way
 
05:45:48.070 --> 05:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
um that they now have to not only
 
05:45:49.270 --> 05:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
contend with you but they have to try to
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
get the firearm out of your holster now
 
05:45:51.990 --> 05:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
when i was trained as a coast guard law
 
05:45:53.910 --> 05:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement member the one thing i was
 
05:45:56.948 --> 05:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
told when we were carrying firearms
 
05:45:58.708 --> 05:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
was that if somebody is trying to take
 
05:46:00.470 --> 05:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
your firearm they intend to use it for
 
05:46:02.708 --> 05:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
you so hanging on to your firearm is
 
05:46:04.470 --> 05:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
literally the fight for your life
 
05:46:07.910 --> 05:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
now we also have the fear of deadly
 
05:46:07.920 --> 05:46:08.948 align:start position:0%
now we also have the fear of deadly
weapons

05:46:08.948 --> 05:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
weapons
 
05:46:10.628 --> 05:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
now if if somebody is killed with a
 
05:46:12.708 --> 05:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
knife is that knife less deadly than a
 
05:46:12.718 --> 05:46:14.070 align:start position:0%
knife is that knife less deadly than a
firearm

05:46:14.070 --> 05:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
05:46:16.390 --> 05:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
we talk about the lethality lethality
 
05:46:19.030 --> 05:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
was said well whatever kills somebody is
 
05:46:19.040 --> 05:46:21.270 align:start position:0%
was said well whatever kills somebody is
lethal

05:46:21.270 --> 05:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
lethal
 
05:46:23.030 --> 05:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
now what we were trained on in the coast
 
05:46:24.708 --> 05:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
guard and this may be different now but
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
what i i remember and i still use is
 
05:46:29.030 --> 05:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
called the use of force triangle this is
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
not just related to deadly force and
 
05:46:33.590 --> 05:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'll define that in a second but it's
 
05:46:35.910 --> 05:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
related to any use of force because
 
05:46:37.510 --> 05:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
there are many levels of force as
 
05:46:39.590 --> 05:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
anybody who supports police or has been
 
05:46:41.750 --> 05:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
a policeman or does any self-defense
 
05:46:43.590 --> 05:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
training will understand that there are
 
05:46:45.350 --> 05:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
certain levels of force that are
 
05:46:47.190 --> 05:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
applicable and appropriate for the
 
05:46:48.868 --> 05:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
situation you are in
 
05:46:50.230 --> 05:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
we'll also talk about what is
 
05:46:51.990 --> 05:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate when you are carrying a
 
05:46:53.750 --> 05:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
firearm versus when you're not
 
05:46:55.350 --> 05:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
the use of force triangle as it stood
 
05:46:57.030 --> 05:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
when i was in the military and trained
 
05:46:58.788 --> 05:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
by the coast guard as a federal law
 
05:47:01.030 --> 05:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer where multiple times
 
05:47:03.590 --> 05:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
i stood over colombian drug smugglers
 
05:47:05.830 --> 05:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
and migrants and people who occasionally
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
had fully automatic weapons and things
 
05:47:09.190 --> 05:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
that we would confiscate doing drug
 
05:47:11.350 --> 05:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
interdiction the use of force triangle
 
05:47:13.270 --> 05:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
is three very simple parts
 
05:47:16.150 --> 05:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
ability opportunity and intent
 
05:47:19.190 --> 05:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
if somebody is 150 feet away from me and
 
05:47:21.830 --> 05:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
they have a knife i don't care what
 
05:47:23.590 --> 05:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
their intent is
 
05:47:24.948 --> 05:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
i do not have a right to shoot them
 
05:47:26.628 --> 05:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
because i am outside the effective range
 
05:47:29.590 --> 05:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
of that weapon if somebody is carrying a
 
05:47:31.830 --> 05:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
firearm they might be within range of
 
05:47:33.750 --> 05:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
you but what is the intent do they have
 
05:47:35.670 --> 05:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
the opportunity the ability if that
 
05:47:38.628 --> 05:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
rifle such as i normally carry is slung
 
05:47:41.510 --> 05:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
behind the back that is a very hard sell
 
05:47:43.590 --> 05:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
to shoot them in the face because the
 
05:47:45.910 --> 05:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
rifle is not able to be presented and is
 
05:47:47.670 --> 05:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
not a physical threat they must bring
 
05:47:49.590 --> 05:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
that weapon to bear we can talk about
 
05:47:51.910 --> 05:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
how police are um
 
05:47:54.230 --> 05:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicated on how their their process
 
05:47:55.990 --> 05:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
goes when
 
05:47:57.990 --> 05:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
they have a justified shooting these
 
05:47:59.670 --> 05:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
things are evaluated
 
05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
now we have rules and laws that cover
 
05:48:04.788 --> 05:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
the feelings aspect where somebody feels
 
05:48:06.070 --> 05:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
threatened by a firearm it's called
 
05:48:06.080 --> 05:48:07.670 align:start position:0%
threatened by a firearm it's called
brandishing

05:48:07.670 --> 05:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
brandishing
 
05:48:09.430 --> 05:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
okay it was mentioned if your shirt
 
05:48:12.070 --> 05:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
pulls up and the handle of your firearm
 
05:48:14.150 --> 05:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
is now exposed that could be considered
 
05:48:16.070 --> 05:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
brandishing in other states there are
 
05:48:18.390 --> 05:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
very specific rules and rsas already
 
05:48:20.628 --> 05:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
covered just like any violent crime
 
05:48:22.548 --> 05:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
against somebody who's afraid of the
 
05:48:24.788 --> 05:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
guns any violent crime that the gun
 
05:48:28.868 --> 05:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
carrier would enact upon that poor soul
 
05:48:30.390 --> 05:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
they're already being able to be
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
prosecuted by law
 
05:48:33.910 --> 05:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
now um
 
05:48:35.270 --> 05:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
let's see we talked about new hampshire
 
05:48:37.110 --> 05:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
we talked about use force differences in
 
05:48:39.110 --> 05:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
training and draw time i prefer open
 
05:48:40.548 --> 05:48:40.558 align:start position:0%
carry as i said that's the way i've
 
05:48:42.390 --> 05:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
always trained okay
 
05:48:44.628 --> 05:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
what is most important when using and
 
05:48:46.948 --> 05:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
carrying a firearm is that you are
 
05:48:49.430 --> 05:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
accurate you know your target you know
 
05:48:51.510 --> 05:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
why and you can articulate that this was
 
05:48:53.990 --> 05:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
justified because heavens forbid
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
somebody uses a firearm in a negligent
 
05:48:58.310 --> 05:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
way i would never want that and that
 
05:49:00.230 --> 05:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
must be the worst thing to be somebody
 
05:49:02.708 --> 05:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
who takes another life out of uh you
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
know when it's not necessary
 
05:49:06.708 --> 05:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
now it was mentioned written house it
 
05:49:10.150 --> 05:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
was clear that he used self-defense when
 
05:49:11.910 --> 05:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
he was physically being assaulted with a
 
05:49:11.920 --> 05:49:13.270 align:start position:0%
he was physically being assaulted with a
skateboard

05:49:13.270 --> 05:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
skateboard
 
05:49:13.280 --> 05:49:14.150 align:start position:0%
skateboard
okay

05:49:14.150 --> 05:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:49:16.070 --> 05:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
that was decided
 
05:49:17.670 --> 05:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
now it's also worth noting that the
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
criminals who were assaulting him who
 
05:49:21.750 --> 05:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
were the victims well i hate i won't use
 
05:49:23.030 --> 05:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
the word victim but who are the people
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
who got shot
 
05:49:26.390 --> 05:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
i believe one was a pedophile and one
 
05:49:28.390 --> 05:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
was a felon with a firearm
 
05:49:30.628 --> 05:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
criminals don't believe in the law we do
 
05:49:32.788 --> 05:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
now we're not only talking about you not
 
05:49:35.350 --> 05:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
being able to have an event where you
 
05:49:37.990 --> 05:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
can't prevent us or a gun owner an open
 
05:49:40.788 --> 05:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
carrier from coming to your event um
 
05:49:42.548 --> 05:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
we can't stop you from coming to an
 
05:49:44.230 --> 05:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
event that's the nature of freedom now
 
05:49:47.110 --> 05:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
you are free to have a no gun event of
 
05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
course you are
 
05:49:50.150 --> 05:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
you can rent a hall you can have a
 
05:49:52.390 --> 05:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
private event you can have security you
 
05:49:54.470 --> 05:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
can hire people and you cannot make it a
 
05:49:58.070 --> 05:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
public event but a public space a public
 
05:50:00.070 --> 05:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
event on the street where you do not
 
05:50:01.750 --> 05:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
have an expectation of privacy and
 
05:50:02.948 --> 05:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that says you have an
 
05:50:05.030 --> 05:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
expectation to be a hundred feet away
 
05:50:07.270 --> 05:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
from a firearm
 
05:50:09.030 --> 05:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
that that's an unreasonable expectation
 
05:50:10.628 --> 05:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
nobody would go for that
 
05:50:13.430 --> 05:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
we've also equated owning guns or the
 
05:50:15.590 --> 05:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
display of guns with crime as i
 
05:50:17.910 --> 05:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned there is brandishing there are
 
05:50:19.110 --> 05:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
actual crimes there's criminal
 
05:50:21.270 --> 05:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
threatening if i threaten you
 
05:50:22.708 --> 05:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
by mouth
 
05:50:24.788 --> 05:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
while i'm in possession of a firearm yes
 
05:50:26.470 --> 05:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's a much different thing
 
05:50:26.480 --> 05:50:33.910 align:start position:0%
that's a much different thing
now

05:50:33.910 --> 05:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:35.270 --> 05:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
now really
 
05:50:37.190 --> 05:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
this is not about the law because the
 
05:50:39.670 --> 05:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
law is pretty clear i don't see how
 
05:50:42.230 --> 05:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
anybody could read our constitution and
 
05:50:44.070 --> 05:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
our laws and understand constitutional
 
05:50:46.948 --> 05:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
carry and pass anything that looks
 
05:50:49.190 --> 05:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
anything like this
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
i'd be liable to call you a treasonous
 
05:50:52.868 --> 05:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
traitor to the constitution
 
05:50:54.708 --> 05:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
that's the bottom line the second
 
05:50:56.948 --> 05:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
amendment protects the first and i
 
05:50:59.830 --> 05:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
guarantee you if there was some anti-gun
 
05:50:59.840 --> 05:51:01.750 align:start position:0%
guarantee you if there was some anti-gun
rally

05:51:01.750 --> 05:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
rally
 
05:51:04.150 --> 05:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
and i was present or some other person
 
05:51:06.230 --> 05:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
was present with a firearm and then
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
there was a person who actually started
 
05:51:11.270 --> 05:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
to promote to enact violence against
 
05:51:13.350 --> 05:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
those protesters the people with the
 
05:51:14.788 --> 05:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
firearms would be the one to come to
 
05:51:16.470 --> 05:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
your aid
 
05:51:18.708 --> 05:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
we are addressing what is fundamentally
 
05:51:21.670 --> 05:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
the nature of self-defense the nature of
 
05:51:23.590 --> 05:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
the idea that you have a right to defend
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
yourself and your loved ones and as it
 
05:51:28.310 --> 05:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
was stated if
 
05:51:30.948 --> 05:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
the fear of something an inanimate
 
05:51:30.958 --> 05:51:32.150 align:start position:0%
the fear of something an inanimate
object

05:51:32.150 --> 05:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
object
 
05:51:35.350 --> 05:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
is allowed to be pushed as legislative a
 
05:51:37.110 --> 05:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
powerful reason to make a legislation
 
05:51:38.830 --> 05:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
like this what's
 
05:51:41.910 --> 05:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
next you don't teach
 
05:51:44.628 --> 05:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
a child who's afraid of black people
 
05:51:46.470 --> 05:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
because they had a piss-poor upbringing
 
05:51:48.070 --> 05:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
to stay away from black people because
 
05:51:50.150 --> 05:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
they're really dangerous you teach them
 
05:51:51.910 --> 05:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
not to be racist and to not hate
 
05:51:56.390 --> 05:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:58.470 --> 05:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
i could go on for days i'll take
 
05:51:58.480 --> 05:52:01.750 align:start position:0%
i could go on for days i'll take
questions

05:52:01.750 --> 05:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:03.190 --> 05:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the witness
 
05:52:11.350 --> 05:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:12.948 --> 05:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
any members of the public president wish
 
05:52:15.030 --> 05:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
to testify that have not testified
 
05:52:15.040 --> 05:52:16.310 align:start position:0%
to testify that have not testified
already

05:52:16.310 --> 05:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:52:17.910 --> 05:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none will now close the public
 
05:52:46.390 --> 05:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:48.070 --> 05:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
this time we'll now open the executive
 
05:52:53.030 --> 05:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:54.868 --> 05:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative burke to
 
05:52:58.948 --> 05:52:58.958 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker mr chair and i'll
 
05:53:02.830 --> 05:53:02.840 align:start position:0%

has that been seconded by representative
 
05:53:14.000 --> 05:53:17.190 align:start position:0%
has that been seconded by representative
wallace

05:53:17.190 --> 05:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:18.470 --> 05:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative berta we should speak to
 
05:53:20.230 --> 05:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
05:53:24.470 --> 05:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:27.430 --> 05:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
i just see so many problems in this bill
 
05:53:30.470 --> 05:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
and you know really i guess
 
05:53:31.590 --> 05:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know i don't even know where to
 
05:53:35.270 --> 05:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
start other than on line 24 and 25. if i
 
05:53:38.390 --> 05:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
or anybody's just traveling on page one
 
05:53:40.628 --> 05:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
if anybody is traveling down the road
 
05:53:42.628 --> 05:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
and there's a protest
 
05:53:44.788 --> 05:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
you know they could get nabbed
 
05:53:47.670 --> 05:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
now yes the first offense is a hundred
 
05:53:49.270 --> 05:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
dollars but
 
05:53:51.670 --> 05:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
each offense after that is a thousand
 
05:53:51.680 --> 05:53:53.030 align:start position:0%
each offense after that is a thousand
dollars

05:53:53.030 --> 05:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:53:55.590 --> 05:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
and i assure you if somebody saw john
 
05:53:58.070 --> 05:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
burt driving by a
 
05:54:00.390 --> 05:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
protest that is against guns they're
 
05:54:02.948 --> 05:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
going to look and go oh he's within 100
 
05:54:04.868 --> 05:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
you know 100 feet of us
 
05:54:07.270 --> 05:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
and chances are he's carrying so they're
 
05:54:09.430 --> 05:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
going to call the police on me and i can
 
05:54:11.190 --> 05:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
see a lot of people getting trapped in
 
05:54:11.200 --> 05:54:12.628 align:start position:0%
see a lot of people getting trapped in
there

05:54:12.628 --> 05:54:12.638 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:54:14.070 --> 05:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know if you just go throughout the
 
05:54:14.080 --> 05:54:14.868 align:start position:0%
you know if you just go throughout the
bill

05:54:14.868 --> 05:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:54:17.910 --> 05:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman there just seems to be
 
05:54:21.110 --> 05:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues to entrap people and
 
05:54:23.510 --> 05:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's why i am going to support
 
05:54:30.230 --> 05:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:33.270 --> 05:54:33.280 align:start position:0%

05:54:38.150 --> 05:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
i would just like to echo everything
 
05:54:40.470 --> 05:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
that the last speaker miss larue said
 
05:54:47.590 --> 05:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:54.150 --> 05:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
yes i want to be very clear
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:54:58.628 --> 05:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about feelings
 
05:55:00.548 --> 05:55:00.558 align:start position:0%
this bill is protecting
 
05:55:02.788 --> 05:55:02.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is all about protecting
 
05:55:04.548 --> 05:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights
 
05:55:06.548 --> 05:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
they were
 
05:55:08.548 --> 05:55:08.558 align:start position:0%
and i think if as you read the bill i
 
05:55:10.708 --> 05:55:10.718 align:start position:0%
think it's very clear from the language
 
05:55:11.910 --> 05:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
05:55:14.868 --> 05:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
that there was a great deal of care
 
05:55:17.590 --> 05:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
taken in the drafting of this bill to
 
05:55:20.310 --> 05:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
protect second amendment rights
 
05:55:22.548 --> 05:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
the right to care the right to conceal
 
05:55:25.830 --> 05:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
carry during protests and demonstrations
 
05:55:28.230 --> 05:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
is in the bill if you want to bring a
 
05:55:30.070 --> 05:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
weapon for self-defense to one of these
 
05:55:32.548 --> 05:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
events you can do that
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill is expressly intended to
 
05:55:36.000 --> 05:55:36.868 align:start position:0%
what this bill is expressly intended to
do

05:55:36.868 --> 05:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
is to prevent situations where people
 
05:55:43.430 --> 05:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
bring firearms to protests to
 
05:55:45.750 --> 05:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrations to rallies
 
05:55:45.760 --> 05:55:46.708 align:start position:0%
demonstrations to rallies
and

05:55:46.708 --> 05:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:55:48.948 --> 05:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
make them and essentially display them
 
05:55:51.110 --> 05:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
in a way that intimidates others it's
 
05:55:52.788 --> 05:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
exactly what representative all chiller
 
05:55:54.948 --> 05:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
was talking about when she was talking
 
05:55:57.910 --> 05:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
about coercive control that's exactly
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
05:56:00.868 --> 05:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
when you show up when you have a
 
05:56:02.310 --> 05:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
especially when you have a group of
 
05:56:05.110 --> 05:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
people who show up at somebody else's
 
05:56:05.120 --> 05:56:06.548 align:start position:0%
people who show up at somebody else's
demonstration

05:56:06.548 --> 05:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
demonstration
 
05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
carrying firearms it sends a message and
 
05:56:11.270 --> 05:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
the message is
 
05:56:13.510 --> 05:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
knuckle under or else
 
05:56:16.150 --> 05:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
and that's totally unacceptable
 
05:56:18.830 --> 05:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
this is a democracy
 
05:56:21.350 --> 05:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
and it just
 
05:56:23.270 --> 05:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
makes me incredibly sad that we've
 
05:56:25.910 --> 05:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
gotten to a point in this country
 
05:56:28.150 --> 05:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
where we don't
 
05:56:30.150 --> 05:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
seem to understand
 
05:56:30.160 --> 05:56:31.830 align:start position:0%
seem to understand
anymore

05:56:31.830 --> 05:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:56:34.548 --> 05:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
what we have to protect
 
05:56:36.310 --> 05:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
i mean we're going through a period of
 
05:56:36.320 --> 05:56:37.670 align:start position:0%
i mean we're going through a period of
incredible

05:56:37.670 --> 05:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
incredible
 
05:56:39.830 --> 05:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
division and divisiveness i think
 
05:56:42.390 --> 05:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that right now it's not
 
05:56:44.470 --> 05:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
easy for anybody
 
05:56:46.628 --> 05:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
and and i think one of the literally one
 
05:56:48.868 --> 05:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
of the worst things that we can do
 
05:56:48.878 --> 05:56:49.670 align:start position:0%
of the worst things that we can do
is

05:56:49.670 --> 05:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:56:51.350 --> 05:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
to essentially
 
05:56:53.830 --> 05:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
legitimize the
 
05:56:56.868 --> 05:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
care the open carrying of firearms
 
05:56:59.990 --> 05:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
at public demonstrations
 
05:57:02.070 --> 05:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i think we've seen repeatedly over
 
05:57:03.750 --> 05:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
the especially over the last couple of
 
05:57:06.310 --> 05:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
years how when that happens when that is
 
05:57:08.868 --> 05:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
allowed to happen it basically turns
 
05:57:08.878 --> 05:57:09.750 align:start position:0%
allowed to happen it basically turns
these

05:57:09.750 --> 05:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:57:12.948 --> 05:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh these events that that are already uh
 
05:57:15.110 --> 05:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
in danger of erupting into violence it
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
it basically becomes the match that
 
05:57:20.548 --> 05:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
lights the powder the tin the tinderbox
 
05:57:22.788 --> 05:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
and it's totally unacceptable
 
05:57:22.798 --> 05:57:23.910 align:start position:0%
and it's totally unacceptable
um

05:57:23.910 --> 05:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:23.920 --> 05:57:24.788 align:start position:0%
um
i

05:57:24.788 --> 05:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
i i fear for new hampshire going forward
 
05:57:31.190 --> 05:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
if we don't have uh if we don't have
 
05:57:32.788 --> 05:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
laws like this
 
05:57:34.788 --> 05:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
because it's important for people to be
 
05:57:35.990 --> 05:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
able to
 
05:57:39.110 --> 05:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
express express themselves without fear
 
05:57:41.030 --> 05:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
of intimidation that that's really kind
 
05:57:43.430 --> 05:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
of what our democracy is all about
 
05:57:45.910 --> 05:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
um and this whole argument
 
05:57:48.310 --> 05:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
that uh that that somehow
 
05:57:51.190 --> 05:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
we're the ones who are in fear is
 
05:57:54.788 --> 05:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh is basically total bs
 
05:57:56.548 --> 05:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
you know what about the people who feel
 
05:57:58.948 --> 05:57:58.958 align:start position:0%
like they can't go to a protest without
 
05:58:00.548 --> 05:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
bringing a firearm
 
05:58:03.430 --> 05:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
especially peaceful protests
 
05:58:03.440 --> 05:58:04.948 align:start position:0%
especially peaceful protests
it's

05:58:04.948 --> 05:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:58:04.958 --> 05:58:06.230 align:start position:0%
it's
it's

05:58:06.230 --> 05:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:58:08.948 --> 05:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
it's sickening and i urge you to reject
 
05:58:10.548 --> 05:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
those arguments
 
05:58:12.070 --> 05:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i urge uh
 
05:58:14.230 --> 05:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
i urge you to also reject
 
05:58:16.470 --> 05:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
the an expedient to legislate uh
 
05:58:21.110 --> 05:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:23.030 --> 05:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm just gonna clear this is just a
 
05:58:24.830 --> 05:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
clarification criminal threatening is
 
05:58:26.948 --> 05:58:26.958 align:start position:0%
already illegal
 
05:58:29.110 --> 05:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's codified under new hampshire law
 
05:58:31.190 --> 05:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
and that's rsa 6
 
05:58:34.070 --> 05:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
631 colon 4. and if you review that
 
05:58:36.070 --> 05:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
there is an enhanced penalty if you
 
05:58:37.430 --> 05:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
threaten someone with
 
05:58:39.030 --> 05:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
a deadly weapon which would obviously
 
05:58:41.430 --> 05:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
include a firearm so any
 
05:58:43.350 --> 05:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
under new hampshire's existing law it's
 
05:58:46.230 --> 05:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
already illegal to threaten someone
 
05:58:47.750 --> 05:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
with a firearm it's actually a class b
 
05:58:47.760 --> 05:58:48.788 align:start position:0%
with a firearm it's actually a class b
felony

05:58:48.788 --> 05:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
felony
 
05:58:48.798 --> 05:58:50.548 align:start position:0%
felony
already

05:58:50.548 --> 05:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:58:53.590 --> 05:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative roy you're recognized
 
05:58:55.430 --> 05:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:58:55.440 --> 05:58:56.150 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:58.708 --> 05:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
i would just as far as um these this
 
05:59:00.150 --> 05:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
notion of these
 
05:59:02.230 --> 05:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
peaceful protests goes
 
05:59:04.788 --> 05:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
i amongst other people watched many of
 
05:59:08.390 --> 05:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
our major cities burn last year
 
05:59:10.948 --> 05:59:10.958 align:start position:0%
that started out as peaceful protest we
 
05:59:13.270 --> 05:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
watched entire sections of major cities
 
05:59:15.350 --> 05:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
in this country be annexed
 
05:59:17.590 --> 05:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
by terrorists and held
 
05:59:19.830 --> 05:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
in some kind of their own i don't know
 
05:59:21.910 --> 05:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
zone or something that they did
 
05:59:23.270 --> 05:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:59:25.350 --> 05:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
nothing could be more peaceful than a
 
05:59:27.270 --> 05:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
christmas parade where i watched a bunch
 
05:59:29.750 --> 05:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
of children get mowed down by a vehicle
 
05:59:32.868 --> 05:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
so this whole notion of peaceful protest
 
05:59:35.270 --> 05:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
i think is suspect at best
 
05:59:37.430 --> 05:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
i think that the person's right to
 
05:59:40.708 --> 05:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
self-defense does indeed trump their uh
 
05:59:43.990 --> 05:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to to be able to hold a
 
05:59:46.310 --> 05:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
peaceful protest when when you have no
 
05:59:47.910 --> 05:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
evidence that these protests remain
 
05:59:47.920 --> 05:59:53.750 align:start position:0%
evidence that these protests remain
peaceful

05:59:53.750 --> 05:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:55.990 --> 05:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
at this time to met
 
05:59:57.350 --> 05:59:57.360 align:start position:0%

05:59:57.360 --> 05:59:59.990 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you're
recognized

05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
06:00:03.670 --> 06:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you members
 
06:00:05.830 --> 06:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
for listening to all the testimony and
 
06:00:07.510 --> 06:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
members of the public for coming in and
 
06:00:07.520 --> 06:00:09.110 align:start position:0%
members of the public for coming in and
peacefully

06:00:09.110 --> 06:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
peacefully
 
06:00:10.868 --> 06:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
exercising your first amendment right
 
06:00:12.868 --> 06:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
without the need to uh
 
06:00:15.510 --> 06:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
brandish anything as it were
 
06:00:17.110 --> 06:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:00:18.868 --> 06:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
it was very nice and peaceful good
 
06:00:18.878 --> 06:00:20.150 align:start position:0%
it was very nice and peaceful good
conversation

06:00:20.150 --> 06:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
06:00:21.990 --> 06:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
but that being said and penalties
 
06:00:23.670 --> 06:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
already existing that's all well and
 
06:00:25.270 --> 06:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
good but
 
06:00:28.470 --> 06:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
all it takes is one man with an ak-47 to
 
06:00:30.548 --> 06:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
wipe out hundreds of people we've seen
 
06:00:33.510 --> 06:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
it in concerts we've seen it in
 
06:00:34.948 --> 06:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
you know we've just seen it in movie
 
06:00:37.190 --> 06:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
theaters we've seen it
 
06:00:39.990 --> 06:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
in so many public spaces
 
06:00:43.350 --> 06:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
and yes it you do have a right to
 
06:00:43.360 --> 06:00:44.830 align:start position:0%
and yes it you do have a right to
protection

06:00:44.830 --> 06:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
protection
 
06:00:48.788 --> 06:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
but you know an eye for an eye and
 
06:00:51.350 --> 06:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
one gun just to cancel out another gun
 
06:00:53.110 --> 06:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
just to cancel out it's just gonna bring
 
06:00:55.270 --> 06:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's it i don't
 
06:00:58.150 --> 06:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
i really don't understand why you need
 
06:01:01.670 --> 06:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
something of such violence and
 
06:01:04.548 --> 06:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
destruction in a peaceful place to
 
06:01:04.558 --> 06:01:05.910 align:start position:0%
destruction in a peaceful place to
co-exist

06:01:05.910 --> 06:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
co-exist
 
06:01:08.788 --> 06:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
unless you are looking to intimidate
 
06:01:12.070 --> 06:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
somebody or take something by force
 
06:01:13.750 --> 06:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
like the january 6
 
06:01:13.760 --> 06:01:24.788 align:start position:0%
like the january 6
insurrection

06:01:24.788 --> 06:01:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:30.948 --> 06:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:32.708 --> 06:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
remember his freak will be recognized if
 
06:01:35.190 --> 06:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
he wishes to speak
 
06:01:38.788 --> 06:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:40.628 --> 06:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
you know i am
 
06:01:42.788 --> 06:01:42.798 align:start position:0%
i think that the sponsor deserves a lot
 
06:01:46.390 --> 06:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:48.948 --> 06:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
it's a subject that is hard to have a
 
06:01:51.350 --> 06:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
rational debate around where people can
 
06:01:54.788 --> 06:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:56.628 --> 06:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
without passions getting inflamed it's
 
06:01:58.788 --> 06:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
very hard to do
 
06:02:00.548 --> 06:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
um i don't like
 
06:02:02.868 --> 06:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
when i see people out and about open
 
06:02:06.150 --> 06:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
carrying i don't understand it
 
06:02:08.788 --> 06:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's necessary
 
06:02:10.230 --> 06:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
i don't really think it's necessary to
 
06:02:12.628 --> 06:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
carry a gun anywhere but that is my own
 
06:02:14.150 --> 06:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
personal thought
 
06:02:14.160 --> 06:02:15.990 align:start position:0%
personal thought
um

06:02:15.990 --> 06:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:17.750 --> 06:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the law in this state
 
06:02:19.350 --> 06:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as i see it the law in the
 
06:02:22.230 --> 06:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
state is that one is allowed to carry a
 
06:02:22.240 --> 06:02:23.030 align:start position:0%
state is that one is allowed to carry a
gun

06:02:23.030 --> 06:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
gun
 
06:02:27.190 --> 06:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
i would rather those laws be changed
 
06:02:31.750 --> 06:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
rather than a piecemeal approach so i'll
 
06:02:36.390 --> 06:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:39.990 --> 06:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:42.948 --> 06:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
i just want to comment that
 
06:02:44.868 --> 06:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
i believe that there are peaceful
 
06:02:44.878 --> 06:02:46.230 align:start position:0%
i believe that there are peaceful
protests

06:02:46.230 --> 06:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
protests
 
06:02:47.990 --> 06:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the first amendment
 
06:02:49.270 --> 06:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
allows for the petition of the
 
06:02:51.110 --> 06:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
government and i assume that our
 
06:02:52.948 --> 06:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
forefathers at that time thought that
 
06:02:55.110 --> 06:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
there would be peaceful protests and i
 
06:02:57.270 --> 06:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
still still think
 
06:02:59.670 --> 06:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of peaceful protests
 
06:03:02.470 --> 06:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
however i don't think that the
 
06:03:03.910 --> 06:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
what happened at the capitol was a
 
06:03:05.590 --> 06:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
peaceful protest
 
06:03:07.030 --> 06:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
06:03:08.548 --> 06:03:08.558 align:start position:0%
i think people can be
 
06:03:11.270 --> 06:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
intimidated by open carry and i'm not
 
06:03:13.750 --> 06:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
going to split i'm not going to support
 
06:03:18.948 --> 06:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:20.390 --> 06:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
this time the matter will now be put to

thank you much
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
let me start by saying that in this
 
06:07:30.310 --> 06:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
country no american should ever be
 
06:07:32.470 --> 06:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
threatened with guns either explicitly
 
06:07:33.910 --> 06:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
or implicitly
 
06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
while simply exercising their right to
 
06:07:35.760 --> 06:07:37.030 align:start position:0%
while simply exercising their right to
vote

06:07:37.030 --> 06:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
vote
 
06:07:39.270 --> 06:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
intimidation including intimidation by
 
06:07:41.190 --> 06:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
armed civilians has long been a tool
 
06:07:43.430 --> 06:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
that some have used to prevent full
 
06:07:46.628 --> 06:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
participation in american democracy
 
06:07:49.030 --> 06:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
during and after reconstruction guns
 
06:07:51.350 --> 06:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
were often used to scare black voters
 
06:07:53.030 --> 06:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
away from the polls
 
06:07:55.670 --> 06:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
that history of armed voter intimidation

misinformation and questionable claims
 
06:08:35.830 --> 06:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
of voter fraud and election rigging have
 
06:08:37.910 --> 06:08:37.920 align:start position:0%

i'm introducing hb 10 1096 today as a
 
06:08:53.590 --> 06:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
proactive attempt to make our election
 
06:08:56.628 --> 06:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
safer for all of our citizens this bill
 
06:08:58.628 --> 06:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
would prohibit open carrying or display
 
06:09:00.708 --> 06:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
of a deadly weapon within 100 feet of a
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
polling place on the days where federal
 
06:09:05.750 --> 06:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
state and or municipal elections are
 
06:09:08.070 --> 06:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
taking place
 
06:09:09.910 --> 06:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
what this bill does not do is eliminate
 
06:09:11.750 --> 06:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
the right to self-defense
 
06:09:13.670 --> 06:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
there are exceptions for voters and
 
06:09:15.910 --> 06:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
election officials legally carrying
 
06:09:17.510 --> 06:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
concealed weapons
 
06:09:19.190 --> 06:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
there are also exceptions for law
 
06:09:21.430 --> 06:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials and pickup truck
 
06:09:23.350 --> 06:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
owners with shotguns or rifles secured
 
06:09:26.150 --> 06:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
and gun racks because this is new
 
06:09:28.070 --> 06:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire and people do come into
 
06:09:30.230 --> 06:09:30.240 align:start position:0%

them
 
06:09:35.190 --> 06:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
what this bill does not
 
06:09:38.150 --> 06:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it is modify new
 
06:09:40.150 --> 06:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire's voter intimidation statute
 
06:09:43.510 --> 06:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's rsa 629
 
06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
it also requires that notices be posted
 
06:09:48.310 --> 06:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
letting people know
 
06:09:51.430 --> 06:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
that this that this law is in effect
 
06:09:53.830 --> 06:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
there are also exceptions
 
06:09:55.270 --> 06:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
06:09:56.948 --> 06:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
six states in the district of columbia
 
06:09:59.030 --> 06:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
have already explicitly
 
06:10:01.990 --> 06:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited guns in polling places
 
06:10:03.990 --> 06:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
and this bill is needed because under
 
06:10:05.910 --> 06:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
current law state and local authorities
 
06:10:07.670 --> 06:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
can't prevent people from bringing guns
 
06:10:10.230 --> 06:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
into polling places even those located
 
06:10:11.830 --> 06:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
in school buildings
 
06:10:13.590 --> 06:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
as an open carry state new hampshire
 
06:10:15.430 --> 06:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
allows gun owners to openly carry a
 
06:10:17.190 --> 06:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
loaded firearm onto public property
 
06:10:19.750 --> 06:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
without a license or a permit
 
06:10:22.470 --> 06:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
and since 2017 the state has also
 
06:10:24.310 --> 06:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
allowed any lawful gun owner to carry a
 
06:10:27.350 --> 06:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
concealed weapon without a license
 
06:10:30.470 --> 06:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
with hp 1096 we have the power
 
06:10:33.110 --> 06:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
to fix a problem in our election law and
 
06:10:34.708 --> 06:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
we also have the constitutional
 
06:10:36.788 --> 06:10:36.798 align:start position:0%
authority to do it
 
06:10:38.470 --> 06:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
the supreme court of the united states
 
06:10:39.910 --> 06:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
said it best when they reasoned in
 
06:10:42.628 --> 06:10:42.638 align:start position:0%
westbury versus sanders that no right is
 
06:10:44.868 --> 06:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
more precious in a free country than
 
06:10:46.868 --> 06:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
having a voice in the election of those
 
06:10:49.190 --> 06:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
who make the laws under which is good
 
06:10:51.830 --> 06:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
citizens we must live
 
06:10:54.390 --> 06:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
other rights even the most basic are
 
06:10:54.400 --> 06:10:55.510 align:start position:0%
other rights even the most basic are
illusory

06:10:55.510 --> 06:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
illusory
 
06:10:58.548 --> 06:10:58.558 align:start position:0%
if the right to vote is undermined
 
06:11:00.948 --> 06:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
however the fundamental right to vote
 
06:11:03.110 --> 06:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
without fear of intimidation
 
06:11:05.750 --> 06:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
vital to our democracy is in is
 
06:11:08.230 --> 06:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
endangered when we allow deadly weapons
 
06:11:10.230 --> 06:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
to be displayed as an implicit threat to
 
06:11:12.390 --> 06:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
others inside and outside our polling
 
06:11:12.400 --> 06:11:13.910 align:start position:0%
others inside and outside our polling
places

06:11:13.910 --> 06:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
places
 
06:11:15.510 --> 06:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
in the heller decision
 
06:11:18.150 --> 06:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
justice antonin scalia wrote that while
 
06:11:19.830 --> 06:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
the second amendment protects the right
 
06:11:21.990 --> 06:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
of law-abiding responsible citizens to
 
06:11:24.628 --> 06:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
use arms and defense of hearth and home
 
06:11:26.868 --> 06:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
he also wrote that nothing in our
 
06:11:29.430 --> 06:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
opinion should be taken to cast doubt on
 
06:11:32.310 --> 06:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
long-standing prohibitions on laws
 
06:11:34.868 --> 06:11:34.878 align:start position:0%
forbidding the carrying of firearms in
 
06:11:37.350 --> 06:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
sensitive places such as schools and
 
06:11:39.750 --> 06:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
government buildings
 
06:11:42.150 --> 06:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
several states including georgia have
 
06:11:44.788 --> 06:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
already interpreted sensitive places to
 
06:11:46.868 --> 06:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
include polling places
 
06:11:49.350 --> 06:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
polling places are public areas they are
 
06:11:51.110 --> 06:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
used for the purpose of facilitating
 
06:11:52.788 --> 06:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
elections that are vital to our
 
06:11:52.798 --> 06:11:54.788 align:start position:0%
elections that are vital to our
democracy

06:11:54.788 --> 06:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
06:11:57.030 --> 06:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
for fans of american history it's also
 
06:11:58.390 --> 06:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
worth pointing out
 
06:12:00.628 --> 06:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
that the very same generation that added
 
06:12:03.430 --> 06:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
the second amendment to the constitution
 
06:12:05.750 --> 06:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
also passed state laws prohibiting
 
06:12:07.910 --> 06:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
bringing guns to the polls
 
06:12:09.190 --> 06:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
for example
 
06:12:12.310 --> 06:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
the 1776 delaware state constitution
 
06:12:15.590 --> 06:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
provides that no person shall come armed
 
06:12:17.670 --> 06:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
to any of them and that no muster of
 
06:12:20.708 --> 06:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
militia shall be made on that day
 
06:12:23.430 --> 06:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
it further provided that no battalion or
 
06:12:25.270 --> 06:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
company could come within a mile of the
 
06:12:28.230 --> 06:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
polling place for 24 hours before or
 
06:12:29.670 --> 06:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
after an election
 
06:12:31.910 --> 06:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
to prevent violence or force to be used
 
06:12:33.910 --> 06:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
at set elections
 
06:12:35.830 --> 06:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
the same year maryland passed a nearly
 
06:12:37.590 --> 06:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
identical resolution
 
06:12:40.070 --> 06:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
new york followed suit a decade later
 
06:12:41.910 --> 06:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
and more and more states added similar
 
06:12:43.910 --> 06:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
laws during reconstruction in the early
 
06:12:46.548 --> 06:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
20th century
 
06:12:49.670 --> 06:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
hb 1096 is not an anti-gun law as some
 
06:12:50.948 --> 06:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
would frame it
 
06:12:53.350 --> 06:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
but instead it's a pro-voter law that
 
06:12:54.628 --> 06:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
will lower the risk of armed
 
06:12:57.030 --> 06:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
intimidation happening in a place where
 
06:13:00.070 --> 06:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
it should absolutely never happen
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that if this bill passes is
 
06:13:02.000 --> 06:13:02.788 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that if this bill passes is
written

06:13:02.788 --> 06:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
written
 
06:13:04.548 --> 06:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
voters and election officials will
 
06:13:06.788 --> 06:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
continue to be able to carry concealed
 
06:13:08.548 --> 06:13:08.558 align:start position:0%
weapons to polling places for
 
06:13:08.558 --> 06:13:10.070 align:start position:0%
weapons to polling places for
self-defense

06:13:10.070 --> 06:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
self-defense
 
06:13:12.708 --> 06:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
the right to self-defense is protected
 
06:13:16.390 --> 06:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:19.190 --> 06:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
the right to vote without intimidation
 
06:13:21.430 --> 06:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
is also protected which is extremely
 
06:13:21.440 --> 06:13:22.868 align:start position:0%
is also protected which is extremely
important

06:13:22.868 --> 06:13:22.878 align:start position:0%
important
 
06:13:24.070 --> 06:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
and this will leave it up to new
 
06:13:25.750 --> 06:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters to do what new
 
06:13:27.750 --> 06:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters do best
 
06:13:30.310 --> 06:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
to choose the best candidates possible
 
06:13:32.150 --> 06:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
without the chilling effect of armed
 
06:13:32.160 --> 06:13:34.628 align:start position:0%
without the chilling effect of armed
intimidation

06:13:34.628 --> 06:13:34.638 align:start position:0%
intimidation
 
06:13:36.150 --> 06:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
i asked the committee to give this bill
 
06:13:38.390 --> 06:13:38.400 align:start position:0%

06:13:42.310 --> 06:13:42.320 align:start position:0%

um where
 
06:13:57.190 --> 06:13:57.200 align:start position:0%

i'm sorry i'm sorry you have to get a
 
06:14:00.548 --> 06:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
little closer to the microphone

most polling places are located in

06:14:36.628 --> 06:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
represent klein knight you recognize for
 
06:14:37.910 --> 06:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
06:14:40.868 --> 06:14:40.878 align:start position:0%
usually in these um peaceful buildings
 
06:14:44.230 --> 06:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:46.548 --> 06:14:46.558 align:start position:0%

or
 
06:15:06.150 --> 06:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:06.160 --> 06:15:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:15:07.030 --> 06:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:15:09.270 --> 06:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
i just said um usually in those kinds of
 
06:15:11.510 --> 06:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
buildings especially whether
 
06:15:13.910 --> 06:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
children would you really need do you
 
06:15:15.910 --> 06:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
feel you would really need
 
06:15:17.670 --> 06:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
to flash a weapon
 
06:15:19.030 --> 06:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if it's the particular
 
06:15:19.910 --> 06:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
microphone in front of the
 
06:15:21.830 --> 06:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative but
 
06:15:23.270 --> 06:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
representatives do you mind repeating
 
06:15:27.190 --> 06:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:28.470 --> 06:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to put the put you in an
 
06:15:30.628 --> 06:15:30.638 align:start position:0%
unfair position
 
06:15:35.590 --> 06:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:37.430 --> 06:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
i believe the the
 
06:15:39.270 --> 06:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
the question was is
 
06:15:41.590 --> 06:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not there were children uh
 
06:15:45.590 --> 06:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:57.590 --> 06:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:07.190 --> 06:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:08.788 --> 06:16:08.798 align:start position:0%
so an answer to what i think i think was
 
06:16:11.110 --> 06:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
your question
 
06:16:12.948 --> 06:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
yes there are some schools i know in
 
06:16:15.270 --> 06:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
ward 5 and portsmouth
 
06:16:17.030 --> 06:16:17.040 align:start position:0%

06:16:17.040 --> 06:16:18.628 align:start position:0%

elections

06:16:18.628 --> 06:16:18.638 align:start position:0%

06:16:20.548 --> 06:16:20.558 align:start position:0%
children are actually have a day off
 
06:16:23.590 --> 06:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
from school during municipal elections
 
06:16:25.590 --> 06:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
they are actually in school during
 
06:16:25.600 --> 06:16:26.628 align:start position:0%
they are actually in school during
voting

06:16:26.628 --> 06:16:26.638 align:start position:0%

you for your testimony the
 
06:16:42.390 --> 06:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:43.990 --> 06:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls representative
 
06:16:48.868 --> 06:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:51.110 --> 06:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members
 
06:16:52.548 --> 06:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the criminal
 
06:16:55.750 --> 06:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
justice and public safety committee
 
06:17:00.708 --> 06:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
i stand in opposition of this bill
 
06:17:03.030 --> 06:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
and i ask that you uh
 
06:17:05.510 --> 06:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
committed to inexpedient to legislate
 
06:17:07.350 --> 06:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is uh basically part two of
 
06:17:08.788 --> 06:17:08.798 align:start position:0%
the last bill it just adds one more
 
06:17:08.798 --> 06:17:11.030 align:start position:0%
the last bill it just adds one more
constraint

06:17:11.030 --> 06:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
constraint
 
06:17:12.868 --> 06:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
there's nothing new to see here
 
06:17:14.788 --> 06:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's bad legislation and it should
 
06:17:16.150 --> 06:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
not continue
 
06:17:17.750 --> 06:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll leave you for the last time
 
06:17:17.760 --> 06:17:18.948 align:start position:0%
and i'll leave you for the last time

and
 
06:17:36.708 --> 06:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
if you need to check that i'm sure
 
06:17:39.750 --> 06:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
everybody has a copy of the constitution
 
06:17:43.750 --> 06:17:43.760 align:start position:0%

thank you for your testimony thank you
 
06:17:45.600 --> 06:17:47.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
chairman

06:17:47.830 --> 06:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:17:53.910 --> 06:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:55.430 --> 06:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for allowing me to
 
06:17:57.350 --> 06:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
speak today just want to talk a little
 
06:17:59.350 --> 06:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
bit about bottom line is this is
 
06:18:02.150 --> 06:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination bottom line absolute
 
06:18:04.628 --> 06:18:04.638 align:start position:0%
discrimination the fact that
 
06:18:04.638 --> 06:18:05.510 align:start position:0%
discrimination the fact that
um

06:18:05.510 --> 06:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:08.150 --> 06:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
i was identified as someone who has an
 
06:18:11.270 --> 06:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
arsenal because i mentioned earlier that
 
06:18:13.750 --> 06:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
i owned more than one gun or that i had
 
06:18:15.830 --> 06:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
applied for more than one gun for the
 
06:18:18.310 --> 06:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
record my first gun was a hunting rifle
 
06:18:19.990 --> 06:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
that i learned to hunt with with my
 
06:18:22.708 --> 06:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
father when i was very young my second
 
06:18:25.990 --> 06:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
gun became a concealed carry um
 
06:18:28.310 --> 06:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
well a second gun became a
 
06:18:30.390 --> 06:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
pistol and the reason for that is
 
06:18:32.548 --> 06:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
because during a
 
06:18:34.948 --> 06:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
mostly peaceful protest
 
06:18:34.958 --> 06:18:36.030 align:start position:0%
mostly peaceful protest
in

06:18:36.030 --> 06:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:18:40.868 --> 06:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
2016 i was physically attacked with a
 
06:18:42.788 --> 06:18:42.798 align:start position:0%
sign poll
 
06:18:45.830 --> 06:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i made the decision that day
 
06:18:47.910 --> 06:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
that i would rather die
 
06:18:52.070 --> 06:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
protecting my life than die a victim
 
06:18:55.670 --> 06:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line here is this again
 
06:18:58.628 --> 06:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
speaks to that sign poll was no
 
06:19:01.350 --> 06:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
different than the sign polls that folks
 
06:19:04.708 --> 06:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
have as you're walking into the election
 
06:19:07.270 --> 06:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
arena additionally if we're talking
 
06:19:09.350 --> 06:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
about chilling let's talk about the
 
06:19:12.390 --> 06:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
number of one party or the other that
 
06:19:14.150 --> 06:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
happens to be at some of these polling
 
06:19:17.350 --> 06:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
places intimidating and coercing people
 
06:19:20.788 --> 06:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
to sign up or by giving away free things
 
06:19:24.628 --> 06:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
or uh you know they've got 23 signs to
 
06:19:27.910 --> 06:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
your one side and they're not allowed as
 
06:19:30.310 --> 06:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
far as i know in my area they're not
 
06:19:32.310 --> 06:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to approach you or
 
06:19:34.788 --> 06:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
continue to run for any kind of
 
06:19:37.910 --> 06:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
political office during that time
 
06:19:40.390 --> 06:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
but i can honestly tell you that they
 
06:19:43.510 --> 06:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
are very intimidating and they do
 
06:19:46.390 --> 06:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
make you feel uncomfortable
 
06:19:48.310 --> 06:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
am i saying that they can't be there
 
06:19:51.110 --> 06:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
anymore because if this guilt bill gets
 
06:19:54.230 --> 06:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
passed then we will expect to see that
 
06:19:55.830 --> 06:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
there can be no
 
06:19:58.788 --> 06:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
solicitation or polling at any polling
 
06:19:58.798 --> 06:19:59.750 align:start position:0%
solicitation or polling at any polling
place

06:19:59.750 --> 06:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:20:01.590 --> 06:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'll take any questions of
 
06:20:01.600 --> 06:20:03.990 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'll take any questions of
here

06:20:03.990 --> 06:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:05.910 --> 06:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the witness
 
06:20:05.920 --> 06:20:06.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the witness
is

06:20:06.830 --> 06:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:20:09.350 --> 06:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
excused the committee now calls david
 
06:20:09.360 --> 06:20:13.990 align:start position:0%
excused the committee now calls david
larue

06:20:13.990 --> 06:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:16.788 --> 06:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
come on david larue um everything i said
 
06:20:18.868 --> 06:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
last time plus i personally voted last
 
06:20:21.590 --> 06:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
year wearing a firearm in my town hall
 
06:20:23.430 --> 06:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
not a school not a library not a place
 
06:20:25.430 --> 06:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
with little kids we voted in our town
 
06:20:27.590 --> 06:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
hall and i will tell you i'm sure i was
 
06:20:29.590 --> 06:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
not the only one with a firearm but i
 
06:20:30.628 --> 06:20:30.638 align:start position:0%
might have been the only one open
 
06:20:32.788 --> 06:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
carrying because as i said i train open
 
06:20:35.270 --> 06:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
carry that's the way i'm most proficient
 
06:20:36.868 --> 06:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
that is the way i'm most able to
 
06:20:39.750 --> 06:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
accurately self-defend myself um again
 
06:20:41.350 --> 06:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
we have this concept that the mere
 
06:20:44.070 --> 06:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
presence of a firearm is a threat again
 
06:20:45.990 --> 06:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
reference criminal threatening
 
06:20:48.230 --> 06:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
brandishing issues getting in somebody's
 
06:20:50.390 --> 06:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
face the way you conduct yourself
 
06:20:53.270 --> 06:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
when you carry a firearm if you're smart
 
06:20:54.548 --> 06:20:54.558 align:start position:0%
not necessarily if you're a responsible
 
06:20:55.910 --> 06:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
gun owner if you smart you conduct
 
06:20:57.670 --> 06:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
yourself differently when you have a
 
06:21:00.150 --> 06:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
firearm you cannot afford to get into a
 
06:21:02.150 --> 06:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
pissing contest with somebody over a
 
06:21:03.910 --> 06:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion because you now
 
06:21:06.788 --> 06:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
have a firearm with you which as we know
 
06:21:09.030 --> 06:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
aggravates crimes under the law
 
06:21:10.628 --> 06:21:10.638 align:start position:0%
so we already have covered this whole
 
06:21:12.788 --> 06:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
dangerous firearm thing
 
06:21:15.430 --> 06:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
we also have this idea that somehow the
 
06:21:17.350 --> 06:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
firearm is intimidating people which
 
06:21:19.510 --> 06:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
direction is the fire intimidating
 
06:21:21.750 --> 06:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
people to vote because as i understand
 
06:21:24.150 --> 06:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
it we're not allowed to wear a political
 
06:21:26.468 --> 06:21:26.478 align:start position:0%
shirt when i go in to vote i can't have
 
06:21:28.708 --> 06:21:28.718 align:start position:0%
on a hillary clinton shirt when i go to
 
06:21:30.230 --> 06:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
cast my vote
 
06:21:32.468 --> 06:21:32.478 align:start position:0%
they won't allow it i know people this
 
06:21:34.070 --> 06:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
last election who were told to change
 
06:21:36.628 --> 06:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
their clothing because you can't do that
 
06:21:38.468 --> 06:21:38.478 align:start position:0%
so if you're not allowed to wear or
 
06:21:40.868 --> 06:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
display anything that says
 
06:21:42.310 --> 06:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
how you're voting how are you
 
06:21:44.548 --> 06:21:44.558 align:start position:0%
intimidating somebody again it's the
 
06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
mere presence of a physical inanimate
 
06:21:48.788 --> 06:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
object that is the reason why this is
 
06:21:51.190 --> 06:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
being pushed um
 
06:21:52.948 --> 06:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
you know and then the last thing is if
 
06:21:54.468 --> 06:21:54.478 align:start position:0%
we are to follow the train because i
 
06:21:56.310 --> 06:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
will use any logic you wish i will
 
06:21:58.468 --> 06:21:58.478 align:start position:0%
debate any logic you wish with your
 
06:21:59.910 --> 06:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
logic that the mere presence of the
 
06:22:02.070 --> 06:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
firearm is threatening and coercive in
 
06:22:04.708 --> 06:22:04.718 align:start position:0%
intimidation what about the cops
 
06:22:06.708 --> 06:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
what about state police chilling of
 
06:22:08.708 --> 06:22:08.718 align:start position:0%
rights chilling of free speech
 
06:22:10.948 --> 06:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
anybody at the executive council
 
06:22:12.708 --> 06:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
anybody ever had a cop right up in your
 
06:22:15.030 --> 06:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
face cops are allowed under all these
 
06:22:17.910 --> 06:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
bills the state is allowed to intimidate
 
06:22:20.868 --> 06:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
and uh coerce and threaten just with the
 
06:22:22.708 --> 06:22:22.718 align:start position:0%
mere presence of a firearm
 
06:22:24.788 --> 06:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
i don't agree that that's the premise
 
06:22:28.788 --> 06:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
but if that's the logic that flies
 
06:22:31.350 --> 06:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
your two minutes is up thank you
 
06:22:36.628 --> 06:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:38.788 --> 06:22:38.798 align:start position:0%
once again the honorable joe hannon the
 
06:22:45.830 --> 06:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:47.910 --> 06:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
hello joe hannan from gun owners of new
 
06:22:50.310 --> 06:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire and uh thank you for listening
 
06:22:51.430 --> 06:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
to me today
 
06:22:53.990 --> 06:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
um like it's been said this has been a
 
06:22:55.590 --> 06:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
lot of the same points as a previous
 
06:22:57.750 --> 06:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
bill but a lot of the words are still
 
06:22:59.910 --> 06:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
the same problem officers on duty does
 
06:23:02.310 --> 06:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
that mean not off-duty pickup truck like
 
06:23:04.230 --> 06:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
i mentioned there are priuses out there
 
06:23:05.830 --> 06:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
with gun racks
 
06:23:07.030 --> 06:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
but it also means if someone has
 
06:23:08.628 --> 06:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
something in their car they can't remove
 
06:23:10.070 --> 06:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
it from their rack and put in their
 
06:23:11.430 --> 06:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
trunk if they're in a neighborhood they
 
06:23:12.868 --> 06:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
might not feel safe leaving it in a
 
06:23:14.390 --> 06:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
visible position so someone can't even
 
06:23:15.990 --> 06:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
take it off of a gun rack and lock it
 
06:23:17.350 --> 06:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in the vehicle if they're
 
06:23:19.510 --> 06:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
parked in a bad area not a lot of them
 
06:23:24.150 --> 06:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire but there are a few um
 
06:23:25.190 --> 06:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of people who are
 
06:23:27.110 --> 06:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
unable to easily carry concealed this
 
06:23:29.670 --> 06:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
allows for concealed carry at poles but
 
06:23:31.110 --> 06:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
usually it's pretty cold and people are
 
06:23:32.948 --> 06:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
wearing jackets so if i go into a
 
06:23:35.590 --> 06:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
polling place i can't take my coat off
 
06:23:36.788 --> 06:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
i'll be i'll be all right i'll be a
 
06:23:37.910 --> 06:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
little sweaty for a while but what if
 
06:23:39.350 --> 06:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
someone goes in that's unable to handle
 
06:23:41.590 --> 06:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
the heat for 20 30 minutes and passes
 
06:23:43.110 --> 06:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
out you know that's not really a good
 
06:23:44.548 --> 06:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
situation to be in someone shouldn't
 
06:23:47.110 --> 06:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
have to dictate their dress code by
 
06:23:48.948 --> 06:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
other people's emotions and if that's
 
06:23:50.468 --> 06:23:50.478 align:start position:0%
the case we can go through a whole list
 
06:23:52.150 --> 06:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
of laws that should be on the books
 
06:23:53.670 --> 06:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
which i don't think should be as far as
 
06:23:56.230 --> 06:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:57.990 --> 06:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
last thing i'd like to say is
 
06:23:59.750 --> 06:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
brandishing has been thrown around a lot
 
06:24:01.590 --> 06:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
is you know something that's a problem
 
06:24:02.868 --> 06:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
the word brandishing does not appear
 
06:24:05.030 --> 06:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere in new hampshire
 
06:24:07.190 --> 06:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
rsas it just doesn't exist
 
06:24:08.868 --> 06:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
uh there are some states that use the
 
06:24:11.350 --> 06:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
word brandishing uh as a specific
 
06:24:13.910 --> 06:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited prohibited act and you know
 
06:24:15.910 --> 06:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
most of those places describe it as
 
06:24:17.270 --> 06:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
waving or
 
06:24:19.190 --> 06:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
especially something usually a weapon in
 
06:24:21.030 --> 06:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
a threatening
 
06:24:22.868 --> 06:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
in a threatening manner in anger or
 
06:24:22.878 --> 06:24:24.150 align:start position:0%
in a threatening manner in anger or
excitement

06:24:24.150 --> 06:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
excitement
 
06:24:26.070 --> 06:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
just holding something even according to
 
06:24:27.670 --> 06:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
that definition or having it on their
 
06:24:29.590 --> 06:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
person openly would not be brandishing
 
06:24:31.750 --> 06:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
in any way so um
 
06:24:33.590 --> 06:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know we also passed a bill last year
 
06:24:35.670 --> 06:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
that said that just the mere display of
 
06:24:37.750 --> 06:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
a firearm is not threat criminal
 
06:24:39.830 --> 06:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
threatening and that was clarified and i
 
06:24:41.350 --> 06:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
believe another i won't mention the bill
 
06:24:42.788 --> 06:24:42.798 align:start position:0%
but it was last year it was passed and
 
06:24:46.150 --> 06:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:47.990 --> 06:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
anyway that's it i'd be happy to take
 
06:24:49.910 --> 06:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:24:51.110 --> 06:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
06:24:52.868 --> 06:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
may inquire with the question
 
06:24:55.350 --> 06:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh so my understanding that this bill it
 
06:24:57.110 --> 06:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
creates uh it would create a restriction
 
06:24:58.948 --> 06:24:58.958 align:start position:0%
with an open carrying with 100 feet of a
 
06:25:00.230 --> 06:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
06:25:00.240 --> 06:25:01.590 align:start position:0%
polling place
so

06:25:01.590 --> 06:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:03.590 --> 06:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
would that apply to a person who's on
 
06:25:05.190 --> 06:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
their own private property this happens
 
06:25:07.110 --> 06:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
to be within 100 feet of a polling place
 
06:25:09.190 --> 06:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't have an exception and also
 
06:25:11.510 --> 06:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh my polling place i know know it very
 
06:25:13.270 --> 06:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
well because i ran there and held signs
 
06:25:15.110 --> 06:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
and electioneering isn't allowed within
 
06:25:17.350 --> 06:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
100 feet and people had to stand pretty
 
06:25:19.030 --> 06:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
close to the entrance some places the
 
06:25:21.270 --> 06:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
100 feet may preclude the entrance to a
 
06:25:22.628 --> 06:25:22.638 align:start position:0%
polling place they might not be even
 
06:25:24.230 --> 06:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to go into the polling place
 
06:25:25.430 --> 06:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
with their vehicle they may have to go
 
06:25:27.430 --> 06:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
home out of their way or be unable to
 
06:25:29.270 --> 06:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
vote that day and could theoretically be
 
06:25:30.628 --> 06:25:30.638 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised because they couldn't go
 
06:25:33.110 --> 06:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
into the parking lot let alone the place
 
06:25:35.110 --> 06:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
itself even if they did lock it up in
 
06:25:36.070 --> 06:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
their car
 
06:25:37.590 --> 06:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
just by being in their vehicle open
 
06:25:39.190 --> 06:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
carry they have to like hide it or they
 
06:25:41.190 --> 06:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
pull in and then not let anyone see them
 
06:25:42.788 --> 06:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
put in their trunk
 
06:25:42.798 --> 06:25:44.310 align:start position:0%
put in their trunk
so

06:25:44.310 --> 06:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:45.270 --> 06:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:25:47.030 --> 06:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:25:48.628 --> 06:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
all good this time the witness is
 
06:25:50.948 --> 06:25:50.958 align:start position:0%
excused thank you for your testimony
 
06:25:53.030 --> 06:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls alan rice gun
 
06:25:58.230 --> 06:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:00.070 --> 06:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
06:26:02.788 --> 06:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
mr chairman once again for the record my
 
06:26:05.110 --> 06:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
name is alan rice and i am a resident of
 
06:26:06.788 --> 06:26:06.798 align:start position:0%
bedford new hampshire
 
06:26:08.788 --> 06:26:08.798 align:start position:0%
and i am here representing gun owners of
 
06:26:11.670 --> 06:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
america national organization
 
06:26:13.830 --> 06:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
all this talk about not being able to
 
06:26:15.270 --> 06:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
carry a gun in the open makes you want
 
06:26:17.350 --> 06:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
to carry a gun in the open i usually
 
06:26:19.830 --> 06:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
carry a gun concealed
 
06:26:21.750 --> 06:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
for personal safety
 
06:26:24.070 --> 06:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to have to reconsider that
 
06:26:26.070 --> 06:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
i have to reconsider that i wanted to
 
06:26:27.750 --> 06:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
expand on something that was said on the
 
06:26:29.590 --> 06:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
previous bill because i think it's on
 
06:26:29.600 --> 06:26:30.548 align:start position:0%
previous bill because i think it's on
point

06:26:30.548 --> 06:26:30.558 align:start position:0%
point
 
06:26:33.270 --> 06:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh this coercive control
 
06:26:35.910 --> 06:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
to me is a fancy word basically to say
 
06:26:37.830 --> 06:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'm too chicken and i don't trust
 
06:26:39.990 --> 06:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
anybody and i have no way to take and
 
06:26:42.070 --> 06:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm unwilling to take responsibility for
 
06:26:43.750 --> 06:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
my personal safety
 
06:26:46.468 --> 06:26:46.478 align:start position:0%
um that that just it's just way out of
 
06:26:48.548 --> 06:26:48.558 align:start position:0%
step with new hampshire values
 
06:26:50.230 --> 06:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
um i'm not going to take the full two
 
06:26:52.390 --> 06:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
minutes um because most of the points
 
06:26:53.910 --> 06:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
are the same as i made on a previous
 
06:26:55.750 --> 06:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
bill and i would ask the committee to
 
06:27:02.868 --> 06:27:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:07.350 --> 06:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:18.468 --> 06:27:18.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:19.990 --> 06:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
06:27:22.548 --> 06:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
hearing my name is penny dean a resident
 
06:27:24.310 --> 06:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
of concord new hampshire
 
06:27:26.788 --> 06:27:26.798 align:start position:0%
and i respectfully ask that you itl this
 
06:27:28.548 --> 06:27:28.558 align:start position:0%
bad bill
 
06:27:33.110 --> 06:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
i would ask you look at rsa 659 43 roman
 
06:27:35.590 --> 06:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
3 which is referenced
 
06:27:38.628 --> 06:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
in roman one of the bill
 
06:27:41.190 --> 06:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that allows the moderators shall
 
06:27:43.110 --> 06:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
designate a preferred area for
 
06:27:45.430 --> 06:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
electioneering and it goes on and on and
 
06:27:45.440 --> 06:27:46.230 align:start position:0%
electioneering and it goes on and on and
on

06:27:46.230 --> 06:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:27:48.548 --> 06:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
so what can happen and what likely would
 
06:27:51.350 --> 06:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
happen is the actual area would be more
 
06:27:53.350 --> 06:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
than a hundred feet
 
06:27:55.670 --> 06:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
circumference from the actual polling
 
06:27:55.680 --> 06:27:57.030 align:start position:0%
circumference from the actual polling
place

06:27:57.030 --> 06:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:27:59.590 --> 06:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
the statute or the bill also proposes
 
06:28:01.830 --> 06:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
that this be all day even if the polling
 
06:28:03.510 --> 06:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
is only part of the day
 
06:28:05.510 --> 06:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
so a person will think well gee the
 
06:28:07.190 --> 06:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
polling is only going on from noon to
 
06:28:07.200 --> 06:28:08.310 align:start position:0%
polling is only going on from noon to
eight

06:28:08.310 --> 06:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
eight
 
06:28:10.070 --> 06:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
this only applies then we'll know it
 
06:28:11.670 --> 06:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
applies the whole day
 
06:28:13.190 --> 06:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of what i call tricky
 
06:28:15.270 --> 06:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
things but i think the most important
 
06:28:16.948 --> 06:28:16.958 align:start position:0%
thing for those who don't carry a
 
06:28:18.310 --> 06:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
firearm every day and don't take
 
06:28:19.670 --> 06:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility for their own
 
06:28:21.990 --> 06:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
self-defense and personal protection
 
06:28:24.948 --> 06:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
i want the taxpayers to foot that
 
06:28:28.070 --> 06:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
people do not deliberately quote unquote
 
06:28:30.150 --> 06:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
bring a gun to the polls
 
06:28:31.830 --> 06:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
when i get up in the morning and get
 
06:28:34.390 --> 06:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
dressed and i put on my guns
 
06:28:36.468 --> 06:28:36.478 align:start position:0%
i put them on just like i put on my bra
 
06:28:38.548 --> 06:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
and skivvies and i take them off at
 
06:28:41.110 --> 06:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
night so i'm not quote unquote bringing
 
06:28:43.750 --> 06:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
them anywhere they're already with me
 
06:28:45.830 --> 06:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
because just like if i knew which day i
 
06:28:47.350 --> 06:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
was going to get in a car accident i'd
 
06:28:49.750 --> 06:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
stay home that day be real simple
 
06:28:51.670 --> 06:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
same day if i knew which day i was going
 
06:28:53.590 --> 06:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
to get attacked by some bad person i
 
06:28:55.350 --> 06:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go out that day but i don't
 
06:28:56.948 --> 06:28:56.958 align:start position:0%
know that
 
06:28:59.190 --> 06:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
and so people are not quote-unquote
 
06:29:01.590 --> 06:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
bringing their guns anywhere most people
 
06:29:03.190 --> 06:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
that take responsibility for their own
 
06:29:05.910 --> 06:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
self-defense have their gun with them
 
06:29:07.910 --> 06:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
and the polling place is no different
 
06:29:09.350 --> 06:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
you don't know if when you leave the
 
06:29:10.628 --> 06:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
06:29:12.390 --> 06:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have a problem and
 
06:29:14.150 --> 06:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the other point which i
 
06:29:15.910 --> 06:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
think another speaker made which is
 
06:29:18.548 --> 06:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
really good i was half my size before my
 
06:29:20.468 --> 06:29:20.478 align:start position:0%
injuries i was a distance runner
 
06:29:22.070 --> 06:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately now i still have some
 
06:29:24.310 --> 06:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
injuries and i'm a much bigger girl and
 
06:29:26.390 --> 06:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that carrying
 
06:29:29.110 --> 06:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
carrying firearms now more likely to be
 
06:29:30.708 --> 06:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
open because they don't fit the way they
 
06:29:31.750 --> 06:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
used to
 
06:29:33.510 --> 06:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to answer any
 
06:29:33.520 --> 06:29:34.788 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to answer any
questions

06:29:34.788 --> 06:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:29:36.948 --> 06:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:29:48.310 --> 06:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:49.670 --> 06:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
any members of the public who wish to
 
06:29:51.990 --> 06:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
testify have that who have not testified
 
06:29:52.000 --> 06:29:55.030 align:start position:0%
testify have that who have not testified
already

06:29:55.030 --> 06:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:56.788 --> 06:29:56.798 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now close the
 
06:30:05.030 --> 06:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:06.310 --> 06:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
at this time we'll now open the
 
06:30:10.468 --> 06:30:10.478 align:start position:0%
executive session house bill 1096.
 
06:30:11.590 --> 06:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative burke do you wish to be
 
06:30:11.600 --> 06:30:14.468 align:start position:0%
representative burke do you wish to be
recognized

06:30:14.468 --> 06:30:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:16.628 --> 06:30:16.638 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman i would like to make a
 
06:30:20.150 --> 06:30:20.160 align:start position:0%

roy
representative

06:30:28.070 --> 06:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:30:30.070 --> 06:30:30.080 align:start position:0%

please

please
 
06:30:36.548 --> 06:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:38.390 --> 06:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
there are several things
 
06:30:41.430 --> 06:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
well like the last speaker said
 
06:30:44.708 --> 06:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:47.270 --> 06:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of tricky things in this
 
06:30:47.280 --> 06:30:49.350 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of tricky things in this
bill

06:30:49.350 --> 06:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:30:51.270 --> 06:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
and one of them is
 
06:30:54.150 --> 06:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
my poland place bartlett elementary in
 
06:30:55.990 --> 06:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
goffstown which has been there over 100
 
06:30:59.190 --> 06:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:02.708 --> 06:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
is within a hundred feet of the road
 
06:31:05.910 --> 06:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
so again i go back to i am driving by
 
06:31:06.948 --> 06:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
the school
 
06:31:09.270 --> 06:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
and at that point i am in violation of
 
06:31:09.280 --> 06:31:10.310 align:start position:0%
and at that point i am in violation of
this

06:31:10.310 --> 06:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:31:13.750 --> 06:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
law this bill if it became law
 
06:31:16.468 --> 06:31:16.478 align:start position:0%
there's just again many things that
 
06:31:19.350 --> 06:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
they're trying to address a problem that
 
06:31:21.670 --> 06:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist
 
06:31:23.030 --> 06:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
i've seen
 
06:31:25.590 --> 06:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
several people open carry
 
06:31:29.430 --> 06:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
at the polling place i myself open carry
 
06:31:34.310 --> 06:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:35.910 --> 06:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not the only one in that building
 
06:31:37.590 --> 06:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
06:31:39.670 --> 06:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
every policeman there's open carrying
 
06:31:41.830 --> 06:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the voters are also open
 
06:31:41.840 --> 06:31:43.510 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the voters are also open
carrying

06:31:43.510 --> 06:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
carrying
 
06:31:45.750 --> 06:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
i don't see any intimidation toward
 
06:31:47.670 --> 06:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
anybody forcing them to vote one way or
 
06:31:49.750 --> 06:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
another because i can't wear a
 
06:31:49.760 --> 06:31:51.110 align:start position:0%
another because i can't wear a
particular

06:31:51.110 --> 06:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
particular
 
06:31:54.310 --> 06:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
political shirt that i wish to wear
 
06:31:56.868 --> 06:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
they're very strict on that
 
06:31:59.270 --> 06:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
so i just don't see where this bill is
 
06:32:01.190 --> 06:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
going to fix anything
 
06:32:03.510 --> 06:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
other than they're looking for a problem
 
06:32:11.350 --> 06:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:16.868 --> 06:32:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:19.030 --> 06:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
so if we don't pass this bill
 
06:32:21.350 --> 06:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
we put one more gauntlet in front of the
 
06:32:23.030 --> 06:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
average person
 
06:32:25.670 --> 06:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
who wants to go to the polls uh to take
 
06:32:27.670 --> 06:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
advantage of
 
06:32:29.190 --> 06:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
something that every american has the
 
06:32:30.868 --> 06:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
right to take advantage in the due and
 
06:32:32.310 --> 06:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
that's to vote for the candidates of
 
06:32:33.430 --> 06:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
their choice
 
06:32:36.948 --> 06:32:36.958 align:start position:0%
without fear of intimidation
 
06:32:39.350 --> 06:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
again we are not saying that people have
 
06:32:41.590 --> 06:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
to go to the polls defenseless
 
06:32:44.708 --> 06:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
this bill does allow for people
 
06:32:47.270 --> 06:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
for poll workers and for voters
 
06:32:48.868 --> 06:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
06:32:50.548 --> 06:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
to bring concealed weapons into the
 
06:32:53.270 --> 06:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
polls what this what this bill tries to
 
06:32:55.030 --> 06:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
specifically address
 
06:32:57.910 --> 06:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
is the open carrying and display of
 
06:33:00.628 --> 06:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
weapons outside polling places which has
 
06:33:02.948 --> 06:33:02.958 align:start position:0%
become a real problem
 
06:33:05.510 --> 06:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
this is not a made up thing this is not
 
06:33:07.910 --> 06:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
not a made up problem these incidents
 
06:33:09.670 --> 06:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
are real and they've been happening
 
06:33:11.350 --> 06:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
06:33:12.628 --> 06:33:12.638 align:start position:0%
and again
 
06:33:14.230 --> 06:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
given the level of division that we're
 
06:33:15.670 --> 06:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
going through right now given the way
 
06:33:18.310 --> 06:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
that so many people are questioned
 
06:33:19.990 --> 06:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
questioning the integrity of our
 
06:33:22.070 --> 06:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
elections questioning the integrity of
 
06:33:24.708 --> 06:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
the voting process the bills that we've
 
06:33:27.670 --> 06:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
seen uh demanding that uh
 
06:33:31.830 --> 06:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
that that that people uh uh be
 
06:33:34.230 --> 06:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
you'll be allowed to uh to stand close
 
06:33:36.788 --> 06:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
to election workers um and and monitor
 
06:33:40.468 --> 06:33:40.478 align:start position:0%
results um we even had one i think where
 
06:33:41.830 --> 06:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
people are going to be allowed i guess
 
06:33:44.070 --> 06:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
to do that now uh in
 
06:33:47.590 --> 06:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
in candidate and campaign regalia
 
06:33:49.670 --> 06:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
the the issue is it is one thing to
 
06:33:51.030 --> 06:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
express yourself
 
06:33:53.270 --> 06:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's another thing
 
06:33:53.280 --> 06:33:54.868 align:start position:0%
it's it's another thing
completely

06:33:54.868 --> 06:33:54.878 align:start position:0%
completely
 
06:33:56.708 --> 06:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
to do it in a way that's that's
 
06:33:58.948 --> 06:33:58.958 align:start position:0%
intimidating to other people
 
06:34:01.430 --> 06:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
coming to the polls to vote should be a
 
06:34:03.670 --> 06:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
liberating experience for every american
 
06:34:04.948 --> 06:34:04.958 align:start position:0%
it should be the
 
06:34:06.230 --> 06:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things that we're
 
06:34:07.830 --> 06:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
proudest to do it's one of our biggest
 
06:34:10.548 --> 06:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as citizens the polls
 
06:34:12.868 --> 06:34:12.878 align:start position:0%
should be an inviting and welcoming
 
06:34:12.878 --> 06:34:13.830 align:start position:0%
should be an inviting and welcoming
place

06:34:13.830 --> 06:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:34:16.230 --> 06:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
not a place where people have to go
 
06:34:18.150 --> 06:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
to run a gauntlet of other people with
 
06:34:20.310 --> 06:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
with firearms
 
06:34:20.320 --> 06:34:21.350 align:start position:0%
with firearms
again

06:34:21.350 --> 06:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:34:23.670 --> 06:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
you know we are not talking about taking
 
06:34:25.510 --> 06:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
away anybody's second amendment rights
 
06:34:27.510 --> 06:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
with this bill what we're basically
 
06:34:29.350 --> 06:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
saying is keep the weapons in your pants
 
06:34:29.360 --> 06:34:31.750 align:start position:0%
saying is keep the weapons in your pants
people

06:34:31.750 --> 06:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:34:31.760 --> 06:34:32.548 align:start position:0%
people
um

06:34:32.548 --> 06:34:32.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:34.390 --> 06:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
i urge you to uh
 
06:34:36.628 --> 06:34:36.638 align:start position:0%

06:34:40.868 --> 06:34:40.878 align:start position:0%

is a disconnect and i think it's a
 
06:35:43.920 --> 06:35:45.270 align:start position:0%
is a disconnect and i think it's a
disconnect

06:35:45.270 --> 06:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
disconnect
 
06:35:47.430 --> 06:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
not only in this hall but in this
 
06:35:47.440 --> 06:35:49.030 align:start position:0%
not only in this hall but in this
country

06:35:49.040 --> 06:35:51.590 align:start position:0%
country
that

06:35:51.590 --> 06:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:55.270 --> 06:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
there is a second amendment
 
06:35:57.110 --> 06:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
that grants
 
06:35:59.750 --> 06:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
u.s citizens rights
 
06:36:01.430 --> 06:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people don't like those
 
06:36:01.440 --> 06:36:03.030 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people don't like those
rights

06:36:03.030 --> 06:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
rights
 
06:36:03.040 --> 06:36:07.670 align:start position:0%
rights
however

06:36:07.670 --> 06:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:10.310 --> 06:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
somebody can't say that my
 
06:36:12.150 --> 06:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
i don't believe
 
06:36:14.390 --> 06:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
somebody should be allowed to say
 
06:36:16.548 --> 06:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
that my second amendment must be
 
06:36:16.558 --> 06:36:19.030 align:start position:0%
that my second amendment must be
curtailed

06:36:19.030 --> 06:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
curtailed
 
06:36:23.590 --> 06:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:27.190 --> 06:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
and that's what i think this is it's
 
06:36:29.190 --> 06:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
they they they want to take away they
 
06:36:30.548 --> 06:36:30.558 align:start position:0%

06:36:32.390 --> 06:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
right so it's not really the gun that
 
06:36:34.948 --> 06:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
they're afraid of right the the town
 
06:36:36.628 --> 06:36:36.638 align:start position:0%
policeman standing there maybe two of
 
06:36:36.638 --> 06:36:37.590 align:start position:0%
policeman standing there maybe two of
them

06:36:37.590 --> 06:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:36:39.510 --> 06:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
they're walking the gauntlet through the
 
06:36:42.788 --> 06:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
police when they get to the polls
 
06:36:44.708 --> 06:36:44.718 align:start position:0%

06:36:46.070 --> 06:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
want to take away
 
06:36:48.070 --> 06:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
my right just to peacefully carry and
 
06:36:51.030 --> 06:36:51.040 align:start position:0%

that's the that's the disconnect
and

06:36:52.070 --> 06:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:55.030 --> 06:36:55.040 align:start position:0%

i'm sorry we're taking witnesses
 
06:40:54.948 --> 06:40:54.958 align:start position:0%

you recognized for a parliamentary
 
06:40:56.320 --> 06:40:57.750 align:start position:0%
you recognized for a parliamentary
inquiry

06:40:57.750 --> 06:40:57.760 align:start position:0%

um are we listening to testimony now
 
06:41:03.110 --> 06:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
that even though this uh prime sponsor
 
06:41:05.830 --> 06:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
moved to interim study
 
06:41:08.070 --> 06:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
yes any member of the public who's here
 
06:41:09.430 --> 06:41:09.440 align:start position:0%

06:41:13.510 --> 06:41:13.520 align:start position:0%

06:41:18.548 --> 06:41:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:20.788 --> 06:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and members of health
 
06:41:22.548 --> 06:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
attorney penny dean
 
06:41:25.670 --> 06:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
in support of hb 1281
 
06:41:28.310 --> 06:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
i think this bill is badly needed
 
06:41:29.910 --> 06:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
the only
 
06:41:32.390 --> 06:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
criticism i have which is actually rare
 
06:41:33.990 --> 06:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
normally i have criticism of bills this
 
06:41:36.150 --> 06:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
bill was actually pretty darn detailed
 
06:41:38.948 --> 06:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
and so i'm puzzled as to why it's being
 
06:41:40.548 --> 06:41:40.558 align:start position:0%
pulled the only
 
06:41:42.150 --> 06:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
amendment i would have respectfully
 
06:41:42.160 --> 06:41:43.510 align:start position:0%
amendment i would have respectfully
suggested

06:41:43.510 --> 06:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
06:41:43.520 --> 06:41:44.708 align:start position:0%
suggested
is

06:41:44.708 --> 06:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:41:47.270 --> 06:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
the person being guilty of a felony
 
06:41:48.830 --> 06:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
and in line
 
06:41:52.150 --> 06:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
12 a person who's taking these firearms
 
06:41:53.750 --> 06:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
is taking on a lot of responsibility and
 
06:41:56.548 --> 06:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
this method is really good and this is
 
06:41:58.070 --> 06:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
good drafting actually most of that's
 
06:42:00.070 --> 06:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
good drafting and so i'd respectfully
 
06:42:02.468 --> 06:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
say that maybe a small amendment
 
06:42:06.230 --> 06:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
but rarely do i see gun bills this good
 
06:42:06.240 --> 06:42:08.230 align:start position:0%
but rarely do i see gun bills this good
so

06:42:08.230 --> 06:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:42:10.230 --> 06:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
so that that's my only thing is i think
 
06:42:11.990 --> 06:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is desperately needed people
 
06:42:14.468 --> 06:42:14.478 align:start position:0%
in domestic situations they sometimes
 
06:42:16.390 --> 06:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
need to sell their firearms to be able
 
06:42:18.390 --> 06:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
to pay on going legal fees or personal
 
06:42:20.230 --> 06:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
expenses when they leave their primary
 
06:42:21.590 --> 06:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
home and they now have to rent another
 
06:42:23.750 --> 06:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
home so i think the bill is a wonderful
 
06:42:26.150 --> 06:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
idea it's timely it's been needed for
 
06:42:26.160 --> 06:42:27.510 align:start position:0%
idea it's timely it's been needed for
decades

06:42:27.510 --> 06:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
decades
 
06:42:29.350 --> 06:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
and respectfully suggest whenever it's
 
06:42:31.590 --> 06:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
ready to be put back out
 
06:42:33.750 --> 06:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
that this concept i mean i can't speak
 
06:42:36.150 --> 06:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
proactively to new language but this
 
06:42:42.708 --> 06:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:44.230 --> 06:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the witness
 
06:42:58.628 --> 06:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:00.070 --> 06:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain you recognize
 
06:43:14.390 --> 06:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:14.400 --> 06:43:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
well

06:43:15.270 --> 06:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:43:16.468 --> 06:43:16.478 align:start position:0%
first they would have to we would have
 
06:43:18.468 --> 06:43:18.478 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing
 
06:43:19.910 --> 06:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
and then we have to open an executive
 
06:43:19.920 --> 06:43:21.270 align:start position:0%
and then we have to open an executive
session

06:43:21.270 --> 06:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
session
 
06:43:23.190 --> 06:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
which i intend to do right after i close
 
06:43:24.788 --> 06:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
06:43:27.270 --> 06:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i will likely be recognizing
 
06:43:30.150 --> 06:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative roy to make a motion of
 
06:43:31.910 --> 06:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
an interim study
 
06:43:34.868 --> 06:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
that provide that motion is seconded
 
06:43:36.070 --> 06:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
it would mean that we're not going to
 
06:43:38.948 --> 06:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
take any action on the bill
 
06:43:41.190 --> 06:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
this year however
 
06:43:42.230 --> 06:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
it would be something that could be
 
06:43:50.868 --> 06:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:52.548 --> 06:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now close the
 
06:43:54.948 --> 06:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
public hearing on
 
06:43:56.948 --> 06:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
06:44:00.548 --> 06:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:02.150 --> 06:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
this time we'll now open the executive
 
06:44:05.590 --> 06:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
session on house bill 1281
 
06:44:05.600 --> 06:44:07.590 align:start position:0%
session on house bill 1281
and

06:44:07.590 --> 06:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:44:08.948 --> 06:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
the chair will recognize representative
 
06:44:11.270 --> 06:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
rory to make a motion
 
06:44:14.628 --> 06:44:14.638 align:start position:0%

reminder the microphone that you're

order
 
06:44:55.990 --> 06:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
as i've been looking through this lovely
 
06:44:58.548 --> 06:44:58.558 align:start position:0%
book of mason's manual of legislative
 
06:45:01.510 --> 06:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
procedures i did happen to glance at a
 
06:45:05.110 --> 06:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
rule that says the body is entitled to
 
06:45:07.350 --> 06:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
debate and healthy discussion in an
 
06:45:07.360 --> 06:45:09.990 align:start position:0%
debate and healthy discussion in an
executive

06:45:10.000 --> 06:45:12.310 align:start position:0%
 
executive

executive
 
06:45:14.628 --> 06:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
session before
 
06:45:14.638 --> 06:45:15.590 align:start position:0%
session before
moving

06:45:15.590 --> 06:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
moving
 
06:45:20.310 --> 06:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:22.628 --> 06:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
that is a correct uh
 
06:45:24.548 --> 06:45:24.558 align:start position:0%
reading and application of the rules i
 
06:45:27.110 --> 06:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
will say that
 
06:45:29.110 --> 06:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
the question has not been moved yet the
 
06:45:31.430 --> 06:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
motion was made it was seconded and then
 
06:45:32.788 --> 06:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
i opened it i was going to open up for
 
06:45:35.270 --> 06:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
discussion so absolutely when it's
 
06:45:38.548 --> 06:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
opened up for discussion uh the rule is
 
06:45:40.468 --> 06:45:40.478 align:start position:0%
generally each member who wishes to
 
06:45:42.070 --> 06:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
participate in the discussion may
 
06:45:44.310 --> 06:45:44.320 align:start position:0%

opened
 
06:45:46.788 --> 06:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
it's within the discretion that you had
 
06:45:48.948 --> 06:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
to recognize a member a second time
 
06:45:50.468 --> 06:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
however that's provided all the members
 
06:45:52.628 --> 06:45:52.638 align:start position:0%

06:46:55.990 --> 06:46:56.000 align:start position:0%

order raised in a proper manner with the
 
06:46:59.350 --> 06:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
exception of you talking over me but
 
06:47:01.750 --> 06:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise it was okay well
 
06:47:04.070 --> 06:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you again and all i wanted to say
 
06:47:06.230 --> 06:47:06.240 align:start position:0%

representative

06:47:11.030 --> 06:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:47:14.310 --> 06:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
roy's decision to
 
06:47:16.468 --> 06:47:16.478 align:start position:0%
interim study this it's greatly
 
06:47:19.670 --> 06:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
appreciated especially for
 
06:47:21.990 --> 06:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
domestic and abuse survivors in the
 
06:47:22.000 --> 06:47:23.270 align:start position:0%
domestic and abuse survivors in the
state

06:47:23.270 --> 06:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:47:25.510 --> 06:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
it just needs a little bit more work but
 
06:47:26.548 --> 06:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
i do
 
06:47:30.628 --> 06:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
wonder why we can't move to itl and vote
 
06:47:32.468 --> 06:47:32.478 align:start position:0%
down this interim study so another
 
06:47:36.390 --> 06:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
motion can be made such as that because
 
06:47:38.468 --> 06:47:38.478 align:start position:0%
it could be brought up again in the next
 
06:47:38.478 --> 06:47:46.150 align:start position:0%
it could be brought up again in the next
term

06:47:46.150 --> 06:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:47.590 --> 06:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
 
06:47:47.600 --> 06:47:50.708 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
recognized

06:47:50.708 --> 06:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:52.070 --> 06:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
based on that
 
06:47:54.468 --> 06:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
excellent point of order i have a
 
06:47:59.030 --> 06:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:01.990 --> 06:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
what is the effect of
 
06:48:02.000 --> 06:48:02.708 align:start position:0%
what is the effect of
the

06:48:02.708 --> 06:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:48:04.708 --> 06:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
interim study this year given our
 
06:48:07.350 --> 06:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
accelerated calendar does that just mean
 
06:48:08.868 --> 06:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
it could come up next year does it mean
 
06:48:10.868 --> 06:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
it could come up in this session or
 
06:48:14.310 --> 06:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:16.390 --> 06:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
if i recall and last term was my first
 
06:48:18.070 --> 06:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
term as i believe it was
 
06:48:19.750 --> 06:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
your first term
 
06:48:22.948 --> 06:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
when they were we had a we had a single
 
06:48:25.350 --> 06:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
hearing where we discussed all the bills
 
06:48:26.708 --> 06:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
that were
 
06:48:29.110 --> 06:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
interim studied in in that
 
06:48:30.788 --> 06:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
when we voted on each of those bills the
 
06:48:32.390 --> 06:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation was
 
06:48:35.190 --> 06:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
do we believe further legislation is
 
06:48:37.670 --> 06:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
necessary in the future or not
 
06:48:37.680 --> 06:48:38.468 align:start position:0%
necessary in the future or not
so

06:48:38.468 --> 06:48:38.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:48:40.310 --> 06:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
this is something that as a committee we
 
06:48:42.948 --> 06:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
would if and this would be
 
06:48:44.548 --> 06:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
more closer to the fall
 
06:48:47.110 --> 06:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
would we make a recommendation that
 
06:48:48.628 --> 06:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
this be discussed
 
06:48:50.390 --> 06:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
06:48:52.548 --> 06:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
as opposed to not and that's that's what
 
06:48:54.150 --> 06:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
the conversation would be
 
06:48:56.390 --> 06:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh index being to legislate is simply a
 
06:48:58.230 --> 06:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
negative recommendation
 
06:49:00.150 --> 06:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your excellent
 
06:49:07.590 --> 06:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:09.110 --> 06:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
at this time the matter will now be put
 
06:49:11.270 --> 06:49:11.280 align:start position:0%

doesn't does an
 
06:51:00.150 --> 06:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh interim study require
 
06:51:02.708 --> 06:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
a report it would go to nobody would it
 
06:51:05.670 --> 06:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
