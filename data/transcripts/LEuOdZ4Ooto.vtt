00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
brought by
 
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
leader cushing
 
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
establishing a secure psychiatric

hospital advisory committee
 
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
as you all know this is an issue that
 
00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
leader cushing has worked on for many
 
00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.670 align:start position:0%
leader cushing has worked on for many
years

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
his concerns are
 
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
that the secure psychiatric facility as
 
00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 align:start position:0%
it has been for many years has been
 
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
located inside the prison
 
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.309 align:start position:0%
located inside the prison
and

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.390 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital but their
 
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
behavior is such they can't stay there
 
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.309 align:start position:0%
behavior is such they can't stay there
but

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
the concern is
 
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
the facility and
 
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.150 align:start position:0%
the facility and
the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh issues of
 
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
whether any therapeutic benefit for
 
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
patients who are civilly committed can
 
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
be achieved in that setting which if you
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
have seen it is very very grim
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 align:start position:0%
what was proposed was a committee
 
00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 align:start position:0%
of of members of the house and the
 
00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:07.990 align:start position:0%
of of members of the house and the
senate

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
to uh advise on
 
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh the location construction building
 
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
and and implementation of the uh
 
00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
of a new secure psychiatric unit that
 
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
would not be part of a prison
 
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.750 align:start position:0%
would not be part of a prison
and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
that process is underway
 
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think there is still work to be done
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.390 align:start position:0%
in terms of
uh

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
how things are set up and how they will
 
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
be run but
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
i think that as matters have evolved
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
the time for the advisory committee may
 
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.750 align:start position:0%
the time for the advisory committee may
be

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
nearly over now and by the time a bill
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
gets passed
 
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
that that ship may have sailed so
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
with that i will take any questions if
 
00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh how much
 
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
how much
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
do we have to
 
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
you know we need to turn your microphone
 
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.550 align:start position:0%
you know we need to turn your microphone
on

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
is this better yes much better okay
 
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh what actually is the heavy lift that
 
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
we have to do because you know the needs
 
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
been there for a long long time is it
 
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
need to raise
 
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate a lot of money
 
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
well my understanding and there may be
 
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
other people in the room who know this
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
better than i do because i did not
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
become prepared to give you the
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
background the whole thing but
 
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.990 align:start position:0%
background the whole thing but
uh

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
the issues over the years have been
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
first of all that it's a very small
 
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
number of patients it's a very large
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation of money
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
it the security that whatever is built
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be secure and safe
 
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
which means that
 
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
if you're looking simply at a cost
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
analysis the cost per patient is
 
00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.710 align:start position:0%
analysis the cost per patient is
enormous

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
enormous
 
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
now what has happened over the course of
 
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
the years and i i'm not aware of all of
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
the specifics of this so i apologize but
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'm introducing this as a courtesy
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
we have over the last year and a half
 
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
made arrangements for
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
more building at the concord hospital
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
site more beds at various other sites
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
and the hope is to rearrange placements
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
in a more appropriate and more
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
therapeutic manner
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
the concerns that leader cushing had is
 
00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.189 align:start position:0%
the concerns that leader cushing had is
that

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
whenever we get into a budget crisis
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
this project although very important is
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
the first one that falls off the radar
 
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.790 align:start position:0%
the first one that falls off the radar
so

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
so
his

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.510 align:start position:0%
his
concern

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
is making sure that there are people
 
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
around who are working hard at keeping
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
people's feet to the fire and keep them
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
and getting people who are civilly
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
committed out of the criminal facility
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
as chairman of oversight
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
i've had conversations with commissioner
 
00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.550 align:start position:0%
i've had conversations with commissioner
shibanet

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
shibanet
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
on this issue
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
in general but also in the context of
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
the state acquiring hampstead hospital
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
which is literally half a mile up the
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
road from where i live
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that a facility partnering
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
with portsmouth hospital to be cited in
 
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
epping and an additional project just
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
got the newspapers here some of those
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
are secure facilities or some of them
 
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
have secure places or wards or units in
 
00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.430 align:start position:0%
have secure places or wards or units in
them

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
so it looks like
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
his efforts over years
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
are being realized and in this time when
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of money available it
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
looks like the plans are going forward
 
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.950 align:start position:0%
looks like the plans are going forward
and

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
when i first was running
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
he was one of the first people i met who
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
was in the legislature and we talked
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
about this a lot
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps he's seeing his
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
vision his hope his dreams in the
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
process of finally being fulfilled
 
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
let us hope it continues to move forward
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 1391 and open an executive
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
session on the same
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
i will be moving itl but i'll let you
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
know how i'm going to write the blurb
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
the committee report if this should pass
 
00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:10.309 align:start position:0%
the committee report if this should pass
itl

00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
will be very laudatory and appreciative
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
of his great work over the years
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
this will not be so much the bill failed
 
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
as it will be your hopes of triumph and
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's how i'm going to write it should
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
this pass
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
so the chair moves as i can do
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
itl the bill
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
could you please explain why
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
why what
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
why would you want an itl is there
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
already a committee
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
no it is to establish a committee that
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
is no longer needed
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
oh because we've already accomplished
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
what the goal was i think so yeah
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
but i'm waiting for a second would
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
somebody wish to second
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
i do too
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative mckay would like to
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
second that now we can discuss
 
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.030 align:start position:0%
second that now we can discuss
this

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
if there's any questions or any
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
discussion it doesn't have to be a
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
the original problem was
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
from the city of concord did not want
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
that placed
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
up behind the brown building
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
and that became a political issue
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
all of that is behind us
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
and the need for a committee
 
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.190 align:start position:0%
and the need for a committee
is

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
is not needed that the oversight
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
committee has that responsibility
 
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.269 align:start position:0%
committee has that responsibility
already

00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
so that the necessity for a committee
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
and you've already stated over and over
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
that nobody wants more committees
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
hope that the itl
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
will pass
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
the facility will
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
be built
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
and the oversight committee will serve
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative shapiro
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um i'm
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
ambivalent about this bill
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
however i would like to point out that
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
the expansions that
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
were talked about in terms of hampstead
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
hospital and
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
other things that have done to make
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
inpatient room
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
i think are a little bit different than
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
what's being talked about in terms of um
 
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
this new hospital which would have to be
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
a forensic hospital
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
um because it is really has to be built
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
to deal with um people who are dangerous
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
serious danger to themselves in a
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
serious danger to other people
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful that there will be you know
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
plenty of advice given in other from
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
other avenues about how this should be
 
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.030 align:start position:0%
other avenues about how this should be
built

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
built
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
but we are talking about a very specific
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
facility and
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
while i know there was some money
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
devoted to this last year or the year
 
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.710 align:start position:0%
devoted to this last year or the year
before

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
i'm very hopeful that it'll actually
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
move forward and there will be a
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
specific facility because
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
people in the old facility are not only
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
not being taken care of properly
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
but they are being essentially
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
imprisoned in a correctional institution
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
even though they have not been convicted
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
of any crime which is the real issue
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
here that we're trying to solve
 
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.350 align:start position:0%
here that we're trying to solve
so

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
i'm ambivalent about how to vote on the
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill but i think that
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
this is an important thing and i'm not
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
sure we're completely over the hurdle in
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
terms of moving forward thank you
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to ask um
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
would you answer the uh representative's
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
concerns may i ask for the
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative to please state the
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
um do you yield
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
i think what we'd like to hear
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
are the plans for the transfer of the
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric unit and and what is
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
being proposed going forward and how far
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
we should probably have done that in the
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
hearing but
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
there were no more pink cards so here we
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
are sure so i'm happy to update you on
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
where we stand with this project right
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
now um i do have a high level of
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
confidence that everything is moving
 
00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:04.150 align:start position:0%
confidence that everything is moving
forward

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
as new hampshire hospital is concerned
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
we are working diligently with the
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
public works department
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
and this project is a design build
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
bid project so at this point we are
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
coming to gnc on wednesday tomorrow with
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
the proposed
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
design firm that has been selected
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
through the rfp process
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
and seeking approval of that company to
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
start the design of the forensic
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
hospital we anticipate that design phase
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
to take us through the summer of 2022
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
at some point in 2022 we will be working
 
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.110 align:start position:0%
at some point in 2022 we will be working
on

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
creating the rfp
 
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.110 align:start position:0%
creating the rfp
to

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
seek the construction company and
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
bringing that to governor and council
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%

in regards to what the programming and
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
setup of the facility should look like
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
to best serve the population
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%

department of corrections currently has
 
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
a secure psychiatric unit which is not
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
part of the new hampshire state prison
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
for men but is on the grounds of the new
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%

services and their plans moving forward
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
i think our bigger role of course will
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
be at the point that they are ready to
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
open their new facility
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit that is currently
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
operated by the new hampshire department
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%

who are incarcerated throughout the
 
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire so there are
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
people receiving services there
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate treatment from qualified
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
professionals to

illness and acute phase of their mental
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
illness so again the department of
 
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.270 align:start position:0%
illness so again the department of
corrections

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
is very happy to collaborate with dhhs
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
as we move forward in effectuating this
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
these laws
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you all
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you paula for your many years of
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
service in a very difficult
 
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.870 align:start position:0%
service in a very difficult
position

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
my pleasure thank you is this transfer
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
from corrections to department of health
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
and human services is that is that
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
what's happening or
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
is this a facility that's
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.510 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
this is obviously the facility
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
as was outlined earlier um is still
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
under planning and construction hasn't
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
been constructed yet so it is my
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
understanding until that time
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
the secure psychiatric unit as
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
established by previous uh policy makers
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
will continue to operate as it has and
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
we will continue to again collaborate
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
with all the people who rely on the
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric unit for that level
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
of care
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
for follow-ups
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
is the end result going to be a transfer
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
or is it going to stay as it is
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
so the end result will be a transfer of
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
some of the populations currently served
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
by the secure psychiatric unit
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
follow up the uh i don't think you're
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
getting my question i may not be i
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
apologize yeah and i'm just going to
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
pretend that i'm working for the
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
department of corrections for a few
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
seconds some of the population that are
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
being served by the secured psychiatric
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
unit come through the criminal process
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
they've actually been adjudicated and
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
they come in and because of the fact
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
that they meet the otherwise criteria
 
00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:03.990 align:start position:0%
that they meet the otherwise criteria
for

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
being forensically
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
want a better word dangerous
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
that it also serves an additional
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
population that is that starts off
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps at new hampshire hospital but
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
not through the criminal process through
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
a civil process but they become of a
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
level of acuity uh that they have to be
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
transferred for a higher level service
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
at the secured psychiatric unit so i
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
hope and i'm going to look at miss
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
mattis because she's got that look in
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
her eye that either i got it dead right
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
or she's going to clarify so
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
i apologize to you representative mckay
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
i misunderstood so the secure
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
in short currently as it exists serves
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
many masters
 
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.470 align:start position:0%
many masters
we

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
people who have been convicted of crimes
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
who are sent to state prisons or houses
 
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
of corrections and need the
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
level of inpatient care because of an
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
acute mental illness are served there as
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
well as people from specifically the
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
developmental services committee
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
community who may be seen as dangerous
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
people who are at new hampshire hospital
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
who the hospital requests transfer to
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
the secure psychiatric unit because of
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
dangerousness primarily to others but
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
occasionally to self in addition we also
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
serve those who are
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
adjudicated ngri or not guilty by reason
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
of insanity which is another court
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
process and then finally this is rare
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
but it does occur there's a level of
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
civil commitment in our state that came
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
into being
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
a decade or so ago
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
called the sexually violent predator act
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
and that under rsa 135e
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
people who
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
have been incarcerated for a sexual
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
offense and are seen as
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
having a mental defect or condition
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
resulting in continued dangerousness
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
will go through a court process and then
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
be if found to be a sexually violent
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
predator will be remanded to the secure
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit so in general
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
no quite frankly specifically there are
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
five major populations served not all of
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
them are going to be transferred to this
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
new facility
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
the secure psychiatric unit as we know
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
it today will obviously change but will
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
still be needed because there are other
 
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.510 align:start position:0%
still be needed because there are other
again

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
populations served
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
i apologize for my confusion earlier on
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
one more question okay
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to get at is that
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
will this new facility
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
come under the
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
responsibilities given to the oversight
 
00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:44.310 align:start position:0%

committee
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
i can answer that through an email from
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner shibanet to me as chairman
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%

of the doc
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%

that's clarified what i was hoping to
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
clarify my my concern was making it very
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
clear that the new facility to be built
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
will be under
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
moved and or the
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%

manchester awards eight and nine um i am
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
not the prime sponsor on this bill um i
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
did draw short straw when mark told me
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
that he couldn't make it today um so i
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
will not hold myself up as an expert on
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
this issue i'm doing a courtesy to my
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
seat mate
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
who did a lot of door knocking with me
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
so i think he was cashing in those uh
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
he's cashed in that favor today
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
um what this bill does is it allows um
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
a facility to take direct payments uh
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
for from services
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
when speaking with representative mclean
 
00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:24.789 align:start position:0%
when speaking with representative mclean
he

00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
sold it to me as a price transparency
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
bill so as this committee is extremely
 
00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:31.510 align:start position:0%
bill so as this committee is extremely
aware

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has some of the highest
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
health care deductibles in the country
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
some of that comes from a lack of
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
understanding of what things cost
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
and the reason this was near and dear to
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
me was
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
about two or three years ago i went to
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
the hospital under the advice of my
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
doctor who believed i was having a
 
00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:51.590 align:start position:0%
doctor who believed i was having a
stroke

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
stroke
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
i believed i was having bell's palsy it
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
in the course of that they did a i
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
believe it was a cat scan
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
and found a
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
cloudiness on my brain which the doctor
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
in the emergency room told me might be
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
brain cancer
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
um so i in talking with the doctor um i
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
said well i don't think it's brain
 
00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:18.950 align:start position:0%
said well i don't think it's brain
cancer

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
you guys have already missed one today
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
so i think you're going to miss two i
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
said well what should i do he said well
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
you can go get an mri right now and i
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
said get an mri from the emergency room
 
00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:29.350 align:start position:0%
said get an mri from the emergency room
or

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
what or could i go get an external mri
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
and he said well you could get an
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
external mri it would probably be a lot
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
cheaper i said what does an mri here
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
cost he said well i don't know
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
and so i had a very
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
blunt conversation with him i said well
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
let's say doctor you are right let's say
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
it is brain cancer i said uh what's a
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
week going to be to wait to get an
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
outpatient mri says in ankle matter
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
so i got the outpatient mri and i do not
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
have brain cancer thankfully it was a
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
previous injury that i knew about um
 
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.750 align:start position:0%
previous injury that i knew about um
so

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
doctors zero ross too that day
 
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.510 align:start position:0%
doctors zero ross too that day
um

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
so that's how mark mark sold it to me
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it allows a facility
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
to set up a very simple direct payment
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
in lieu of all of the other options that
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
they are required to take
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
the the negatives that i saw from this
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill because was that
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know if
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
a facility wants to enter into this
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
there might be less facilities on the
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
market i highly doubt that will happen
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
um because
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
everyone is going to be a medicaid
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
medicare insurance um the amount of
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
people that would probably take
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
advantage of should be very low
 
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.549 align:start position:0%
advantage of should be very low
however

00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
i believe it would create tr price tax
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
would create price transparency which i
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
think we desperately need
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
you guys know a lot more about health
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
care than i ever will but i do know that
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
our system is inherently broken and one
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
of the biggest ways it's broken is just
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
how things are priced differently for
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
different people for different reasons
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe that that's right so
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's why i signed on to the bill
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
there are people coming up behind me
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
which will be much
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
better at answering the technical
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
questions because i am not going to once
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
again do not hold myself up as an expert
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
in this field at all um i'm i'm willing
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
to take a stab at it but please do not
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
be offended if i
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
choose to uh punt
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh doctor excuse me oh yes yes i like
 
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.590 align:start position:0%
uh doctor excuse me oh yes yes i like
this

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative barry um
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
is it not a law in new hampshire that
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
prices should be posted and readily
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
available so
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
that doctor could very quickly consult
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
what his facility would charge you
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
i would hope so once again not an expert
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
in this field
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
so you you're probably correct
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
uh may i ask representative kenner who
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
or that he can ask a question of his own
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
choosing well i had planned and asked a
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
question but i mean i think one of the
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
difficulties in trying to get prices is
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
it all depends on what your insurance is
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
because they each negotiate different
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
rates and when they negotiate different
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
rates they also consider that
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
proprietary information that they don't
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
want to disclose that's what one of the
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
concerns was about the posting of prices
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
so i think it's very confusing but
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
you're right there was a ruling that
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
came out
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
a few years ago to require transparency
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh and have lists i don't know exactly
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
how well that's all been implemented yet
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
you may now ask your own question okay
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate your pinch hitting
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for doing so you did a good
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
job and you did allude to a very
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
important factor that many of the
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals a large proportion of their
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
patients are
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid and we refer to
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
that as a payer mix for the various
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
things do you have any uh
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
thoughts about the implications for our
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
when we are going to skim off the high
 
00:31:51.919 --> 00:31:53.990 align:start position:0%
when we are going to skim off the high
revenue

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
paying patients
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
leaving them with only the low revenue
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
paying patients
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
that is likely to lead to their closure
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
since they run on razor thin margins
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
they're thereby
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
losing access to obstetrical and
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
emergency services in many of our
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals that serve as critical access
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals do you have any concerns about
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
that uh yes but i think to the greater
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
point i mean specifically i do know
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
because my dad worked for the largest
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
health care provider in the state of
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
texas he actually worked with
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
insurances on how they set these prices
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if the statistic is
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
true it's probably 10 years old now but
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
he told me
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
this was back when i was in high school
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
that medicaid and medicare typically pay
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
like 80 percent of actual cost
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
um he said it was way underneath i don't
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
know it might be lower
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i i guess my my counter
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
you are you are correct in your
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
assertion uh there's no denying that my
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
counterpoint would be that's a problem
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
with medicaid and medicare that this the
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
state or this or the um the program as a
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
whole has to address is why it's not
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
properly paying for the services that
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
it's using those costs are already being
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
passed on
 
00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.710 align:start position:0%
passed on
um

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
to the other patients including myself
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
i'm having health insurance right
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
you know that's how that works because a
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
hospital at the end of the day as much
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
as they may not like to admit it is a
 
00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:12.950 align:start position:0%
as they may not like to admit it is a
business

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
and they do have to make payroll and i
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
do know from the business world that if
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
you're losing money on one customer it's
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative merchant was next and
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
and also representative thank you for
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
it says in here direct payment
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
now does that imply that
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
i paid the bill but then i turned around
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
and sent the bill to my insurance
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
company to get reimbursed because that's
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
a back door into what you're trying to
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
avoid um no because it says is not
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursed or otherwise paid by a third
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you this this i think everybody's
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
been trying to get at this but i'm going
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
to try and get at it a different way
 
00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:04.470 align:start position:0%
to try and get at it a different way
uh

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
you talked to us a great deal about the
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
lack of transparency and fees and costs
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the concerns that everybody has that
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
one person is charged differently from
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
other people but isn't it true that this
 
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.430 align:start position:0%
other people but isn't it true that this
bill

00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
by its own wording
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about fees and
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
costs it just exempts
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
those facilities
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
who take direct payment that's
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
unreimbursed by anybody else and only
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
take that from having to serve anybody
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
who can't show up with their cash in
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
their hand
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
that's all this bill does it does
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
nothing to address the issue of the
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
differential payment problems is that
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
correct uh correct but you would still
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
if you're making a direct payment you're
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
still going to be able to find out what
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
you're paying so it's the the underlying
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
concept is still there but it's a fair
 
00:34:53.839 --> 00:34:56.550 align:start position:0%
concept is still there but it's a fair
point

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative for being here and
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
presenting the bill for our colleague
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
as we're discussing this discrepancies
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
in payment um i think that the
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
difference between state reimbursed the
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid firs and insurance
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
companies makes a lot of sense but here
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
we're looking only at people who are
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
paying cash who will know what they're
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
paying for
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
so do you see these people paying out of
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
pocket as the people who are the ones
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
making up the cost of the of the
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid in the critical
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
access hospitals or do you see these as
 
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.270 align:start position:0%
access hospitals or do you see these as
just

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
a smaller group not the ones who are
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
being paid by insurance with all of
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
those big premiums behind them and
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
therefore not draining off
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
off our hospitals i view this as a very
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
small subset um if if if this were to
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
become law i would still have health
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
insurance we wouldn't go to a cash
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
system myself
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
thank you just like you don't have to
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
have car insurance but you know what i
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
renewed it last night
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking dollars
 
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.390 align:start position:0%
we're talking dollars
but

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
in the midst that it is also quality was
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
there any discussion
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh when you were talking with your
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
physician or anybody else for that
 
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.430 align:start position:0%
physician or anybody else for that
matter

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
about the difference between the mri at
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
versus the mri at the other facility
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is actually my favorite
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
part of the story i'm glad you brought
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
it up i got the exact same mri i would
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
have i still went to the hospital for
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
the mri
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
i just scheduled it
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up when you say you got
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
the same mri uh how would you interpret
 
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.710 align:start position:0%
the same mri uh how would you interpret
that

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
it's the same machine at the same
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
location i don't think cmc has that many
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
mri machines
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh what about the
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
hospitals have different mris
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh are you aware that
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
a particular note uh called the power of
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
the magnets called tesla
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
saying that you are now way outside of
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
my scope well this is critically
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
important i'll give you an example why
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
this is critically important and it
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
should be transparent to patients and is
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
not i'm a retired
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
orthopedic hand surgeon
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
i've done a lot of technical things in
 
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.270 align:start position:0%
i've done a lot of technical things in
hand

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
a patient comes in workers comp
 
00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.790 align:start position:0%
a patient comes in workers comp
and

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
needs a wrist
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
evaluation by sending for an mri at a
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
facility that i know has the correct
 
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.870 align:start position:0%
facility that i know has the correct
tesla

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
tesla
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
the insurance company says no
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to go to another facility
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
that tesla
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
the magnet is not sufficiently powerful
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
to give the data the data came back norm
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
or the reading came back normal
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
i said no
 
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:42.950 align:start position:0%
i said no
the

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
magnet is not a sufficient size to give
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
the proper reading
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
for that for this particular entity the
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
basic uh
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
i was able to get it uh cleared through
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
workers comp hearing to get a higher
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
tesla which showed a terror in his
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
what's called the tfc in his wrist
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
that is critically important and it can
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
be for other entities as well
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the economics and
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
that should be transparent
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
and evened out but i think the patients
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
also need to be aware
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
that the physics that involved in mris
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
is not the same just because they have
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
an mri it's not the same in the next one
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
the tesla power can vary dramatically
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the same facility because they have
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
multiple mris representative would you
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
believe that i i would yes yes i would
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
allowing another question
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
my question is when
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
we're seeing people that have to jump
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
through the hoops of going through one
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
mri machine before getting to the one
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct by being in a direct
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
payment model and people choosing to
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
pursue their care through this direct
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
payment can they avoid that first one
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's the f that's the insurance first
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
gatekeeping step in order to receive the
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
proper quality of diagnosis without
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
having to do all of these different
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
checks in order to make sure in order to
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
do what right now people are doing to
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
limit cost in order to seek the
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate level of care the first time
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
correct it allows for the direct
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
purchasing of medical procedures so that
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
would be one of the medical procedures
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
that you could directly purchase and not
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
have to deal with the bureaucracy of
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
your insurance company or another
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
workers comp claim
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
so this would mean that you would get
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
the service and if you have your own
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
insurance you would fight over the
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
insurance later but you would get the
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
service no no you would not so if if you
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
if you go through your insurance you
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
can't option you can't exercise this
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
option because that's a as
 
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.030 align:start position:0%
option because that's a as
a

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative merchant pointed out or
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
was making the point it's uh that would
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
be a reimbursement later so you would be
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
you'd be circumventing that um so no you
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
could not do that okay representative
 
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
so what's to prevent a patient today
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
to go into a hospital any medical
 
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.470 align:start position:0%
to go into a hospital any medical
facility

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
and pay cash to begin with because in
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
the world of pharmacy which is my
 
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.109 align:start position:0%
the world of pharmacy which is my
background

00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
we have times in which the patient can
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
pay cash and avoid using their insurance
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
company so they don't come into the
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy of the insurance company
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
that they chose and said to do it by
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
cash why could this happen in this
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
situation too where patients would walk
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
into a er anywhere else if they wanted
 
00:40:30.319 --> 00:40:31.030 align:start position:0%
into a er anywhere else if they wanted
to

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
pay cash and ask the questions
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
correct so they i i i will assume that
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
answers that is that they probably could
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
i do not know the answer to that i'll
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
let somebody behind me do that however
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
what this would do is allow a facility
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
to only take cash if they so chose
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman pearson and thank you
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative barry oh sorry i'm
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
just a clarification on the whole are
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
you reimbursed
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
over the holidays i was visiting my
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
brother and his wife
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
decided to purchase some health
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
insurance they looked around
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
and what she ended up with is once a
 
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.710 align:start position:0%
and what she ended up with is once a
month

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
she receives the name of a person and
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
their address and she writes a check to
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
that person
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
and it's a cost sharing type of thing
 
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.870 align:start position:0%
and it's a cost sharing type of thing
and

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
so if she then goes to the doctor runs
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
up some bills
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
then she starts getting
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
checks ev every month until that's paid
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
off from people around the country
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
that's reimbursed but it's not through
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
an insurance company is there a way to
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
loop that in
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
so that would probably require once
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
again not holding myself up an expert on
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
this field um but it does say or
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise paid by a third party i would
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
consider that a third party but once
 
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.309 align:start position:0%
consider that a third party but once
again

00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's a question the committee
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
needs to solve
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's a very good question it sounds like
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
a good system i might be
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
maybe might be asking for some addresses
 
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.589 align:start position:0%
maybe might be asking for some addresses
later

00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question would you believe
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
that i recently had to get an mri
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
and it needed to be done quickly
 
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.990 align:start position:0%
and it needed to be done quickly
i

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
contacted a local hospital
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh in near my home
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
and they wanted fifteen hundred dollars
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i contacted another facility not
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
near my home and they wanted eight
 
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.630 align:start position:0%
near my home and they wanted eight
hundred

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
so i was
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
able to choose
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
which facility i wanted to go to and i
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
did pay cash i had no insurance at that
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
time would you believe that i i would
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
believe that in fact um i believe
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
um one of my favorite people to watch in
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
the medical field is
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
nick valus with bedford ambulatory
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that he prides
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
himself with
 
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:07.990 align:start position:0%
himself with
is

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
is lowering the costs of ever of common
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
procedures and making them more
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
accessible to everyone um i think he had
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
one of the first uh
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh open mri machines is what they were
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
what they referred to um my
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
my fiancee and now wife had to it may
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
have been with some other i hope it was
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
an mri machine
 
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.030 align:start position:0%
an mri machine
um

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
and my my fiance my wife keep saying
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
fiance we were married in april um she's
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
extremely claustrophobic so she when she
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
had a workers comp issue she went there
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm very supportive whenever we can
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of medicine especially
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
through the free market
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
and it's such a
 
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.109 align:start position:0%
and it's such a
intrinsically

00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
intrinsically
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
flawed system to begin with and there's
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
just so much i don't even know how you
 
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
guys deal with it all it's it's so
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
tangled up and
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's no wonder why it's grossly
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
expensive representative barry we really
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
being a quick study on this subject but
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
we do have a couple people behind you
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
who are probably a little bit more
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
expert i am more than happy to stop and
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
get out of the hot seat you might like
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
to yield to them thank you he's yielding
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%

state we are opposed to this bill we

have concerns that this bill would
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
impede access to services if a health

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
such as ambulatory surgery centers
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
hospice facilities urgent care centers
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
and or birthing centers
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
in addition healthcare special
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
healthcare license would be cardiac cath
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
laboratory services open heart coronary
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
artery bypass
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
graft surgery and mega voltage what i
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
did not name
 
00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.030 align:start position:0%
did not name
was

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
what representative berry was talking
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
about radiology services are not
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
licensed under the state of new
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire so
 
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.069 align:start position:0%
hampshire so
um

00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
if people want to go and well first of
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
all like representative merchants said
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
you can go and pay cash wherever you
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
would like if you choose not to use your
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
insurance what this does is really
 
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
bypass the requirement for charity care
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
policy and i think that is a very
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
dangerous approach to
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
allow health care facilities to not
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
provide charity care policies that is
 
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.349 align:start position:0%
provide charity care policies that is
fundamental

00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
fundamental
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
to ensuring access to care
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
and um so you can pay out of pocket if
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
you want but again
 
00:46:50.319 --> 00:46:51.270 align:start position:0%
you want but again
that's

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
the charity care policy is really what
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
is impacted by this that it would allow
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire to license
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
facilities and not require them to have
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
charity care policies i think that's
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
that is something that um
 
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.630 align:start position:0%
that is something that um
is

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
i think really problematic um it also
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
would allow for these types of
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
facilities to exclusively provide
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
services to persons who make direct
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
payment and to not have charity care
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
policies as i said
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
we of course the hospitals fall under
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
this policy or the statute provide care
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
to all patients regardless of their
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
ability to pay
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
we do not believe it's in the best
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
interest of the patients seeking care in
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
these facilities to not be assured that
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
the facility maintain a charity care
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
policy and to rep to representative
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
knurk's point
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
that this would be
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
a negative impact to all facilities and
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
certainly the critical access hospitals
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
because their margins are so low
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
and their
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
payer mix of medicare and medicaid are
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
so high as well as uncompensated care
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
so again
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is would really negatively impact
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
them i'm also not aware of any licensed
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
health care facility that only accepts
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
payments directly from a patient that
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
would mean that the facility would not
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
accept any form of insurance including
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
medicare medicaid and third party
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
we do not believe this bill is
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate and we ask that you find
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
this bill in expedient to legislate it's
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
worth noting this exact bill was
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
introduced last year by the same sponsor
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
and heard in this committee your
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
committee voted 18 to 3 in expedient to
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
legislate but due to time constraints
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
during the house session back in
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
february of 21 the bill was special
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
ordered to the next session day and was
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately not voted on it was we always
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
call it the miscellaneous category
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
that's where this bill landed last year
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
so um we asked that you vote this in
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate as you did last
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
year i'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
but i did want to address a couple
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
things i think it's
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
people use the word getting
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
priced differently by different care
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
there is no different pricing um
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals have a charge master which is
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
about 50 000 codes um probably more um
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative merchants shaking his
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
head um and so the charge is a charge is
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
a charge what's different is the
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and so in addition so i
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
think that's important to
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge that they're not charged
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
differently they're charged the same
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
what an uninsured person gets because of
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
the law that's on the books in new
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire is they have a discounted rate
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
if they are if they're
 
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
what's called self-pay actually what's
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
kind of been i think kind of ironic is
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals have to fall under that
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
self-pay policy which reduces their
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursement their
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
their what they
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
bill to the individual that's
 
00:49:52.359 --> 00:49:54.069 align:start position:0%
bill to the individual that's
uninsured

00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
uninsured
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
but a lot of other um
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
facilities don't it doesn't apply to
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
them um so i think that's kind of ironic
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is the no surprises
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
act um is what everyone's talking about
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
that is the transparency bill that was
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
passed by congress and is being
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
implemented as we speak
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
the hospitals
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
parts of that that went into effect in
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
21 and now the carriers
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
in 22 just this month are responsible
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
for certain components of it it's very
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
complex lots and lots of components to
 
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.150 align:start position:0%
complex lots and lots of components to
it

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
you will find the hospitals have to and
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
they do
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
by law they have to
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
post their charges on their
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
websites which they do um i will readily
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
admit it's um it's a bit cumbersome
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
because i mentioned there are 50 000
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
codes so it's it's a bit cumbersome but
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
that is what the law says so
 
00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:47.589 align:start position:0%
that is what the law says so
um

00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
and then in addition to that hospitals
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
do provide
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
services and they they answer questions
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
for individuals help them if they have a
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
question i would contend that a patient
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
financial services person is better
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
equipped to answer a question versus an
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
ed doc relative to what an mri would
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
cost but
 
00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:07.589 align:start position:0%
cost but
um

00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
regardless it's on their website so i am
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions but again
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
our hospitals have worked diligently to
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are providing care to
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
all members
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
of the public and
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
again i i encourage you all to go on
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
their websites and i'm happy to answer
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
taking the question and being here today
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
i know reimbursement is a really
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
challenging issue and it's one that i've
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
dealt with a lot in the past i'm curious
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
what percentage of care is paid at the
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
charge master rate
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
relative to those that are discounted
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
off through either the
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%

discount the cms and the medicaid
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
discounts do we have anyone paying full
 
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.710 align:start position:0%
discounts do we have anyone paying full
vote

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
likely not
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
i mean no because they either fall under
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
insurance or they they
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
raise their hand they say i'm self
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
i don't have any insurance or on
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
self-pay and then they are required it
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if you're a millionaire
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
or if you um
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
just happen to not have any insurance
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
and unable to pay for it uh able to pay
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
for insurance they must by law
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
provide them that discount so i think
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
basically no one's paying
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
charge master rates
 
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.030 align:start position:0%
charge master rates
follow-up

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
when when prices are going to be
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
provided will it be that charge master
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
rate and so then people pretty much know
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
what they're maxed out on for the
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
payment but they can't but they're not
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
sure where it'll actually fall
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
it i am not an expert when it comes to
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
the no surprises act my prior job before
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
i did this job at the hospital
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
association um 20 years ago was working
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
in reimbursement so i as i am as well
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
very versed in this but not in the last
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
six years so
 
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.390 align:start position:0%
six years so
um

00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
they um again you i encourage you to go
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
on their websites and see and the
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
insurers are also responsible for for
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
providing that information i believe
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
they actually have to show what
 
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
depending on what your insurance is what
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
the um what the
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
balance is that you would be due but
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
remember they're very high deductible
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
plans now so
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with a hospital
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
that has to do with your insurance
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
but for self pay
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
again the there are self-paid discounts
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
if you go to the department of insurance
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
website you will see what those
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
self-paid discounts are on their health
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
cost website that is another really good
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
resource that i know this committee has
 
00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.950 align:start position:0%
resource that i know this committee has
had

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
presentations by the department the
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
self-paid discounts are right on the
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
website so that is also um
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
um for anyone to to
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
access thank you i would have needed
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
cardiac care if i had to pay the 80 000
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
build for my leg it was only 25k
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
milligan always good to see you nice to
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
see you
 
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.549 align:start position:0%
see you
um

00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
24 hours
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
it says unless the facility
 
00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:15.829 align:start position:0%
it says unless the facility
exclusively

00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
exclusively
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
provides services to persons who make
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
direct payments for services
 
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.670 align:start position:0%
direct payments for services
exclusively

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
exclusively
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
does this mean
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
that a healthcare professional
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
a physical therapist occupational
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
therapist speech therapist um
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps even you know a camp surgeon who
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
can hang a sign out in their office
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
saying we do not accept
 
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.870 align:start position:0%
saying we do not accept
insurance

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
you must self-pay
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
and therefore we can charge what we want
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
to charge does this then create a
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
two-tier system in which people who have
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
the ability to pay out of pocket
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
get private services
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
people who rely on health insurance have
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
to go to different providers
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
and these i'm going to call them
 
00:55:04.559 --> 00:55:06.230 align:start position:0%
and these i'm going to call them
entrepreneurial

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial
 
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.510 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial
providers

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
thereby avoid the cost the paper
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
processing cost of filing for insurance
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
is that what happens well
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
this bill wouldn't do that per se
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
because it's the statute they're
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
changing um physicians physical
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
therapists speak all the professionals
 
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned are not don't
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
don't fall under the statute this is
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
health facilities they fall under oplc
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
they fall under their individual
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
clinical licenses um so they're not
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
licensed that way in the state of new
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire they and that's considered
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
what i think
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative marsh would call
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
concierge medicine right um so
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
that is allowable um now um and i i know
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
that there are some um certainly
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
positions um that that offer that like
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
you said you have to you i don't quite
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
mechanics but i think you either pay a
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
monthly fee i'm looking at
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
the doctors in the in the room you pay a
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
monthly fee maybe an annual fee and then
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
you get certain number of visits and
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
then whatever it is um so
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
direct primary thank you yes i call it
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
concierge medicine but
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
my my daughter always corrects me she's
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
a family doc and she says no it's direct
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
primary care mom my wife is a family dog
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
and we do it for poor people because we
 
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
don't have any rich people coming to us
 
00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.309 align:start position:0%
don't have any rich people coming to us
[Laughter]

00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:56:28.319 --> 00:56:29.589 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
um

00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:29.599 --> 00:56:30.549 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i answered your
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
question except that's not what this
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill does i guess um and it's still
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
allowable i would say but we can open a
 
00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.470 align:start position:0%
allowable i would say but we can open a
facility

00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
that offers a wide variety of services
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
that comes under this bill it just has
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
to be a facility we can open a
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
corporation we can have offices we can
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
have a building
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
does that then become a healthcare
 
00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.150 align:start position:0%
does that then become a healthcare
facility

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
as i was just looking at the
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
department's website i will
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
they license for instance residential
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
care facilities they license um
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
nursing homes they license laboratory
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
walk-in centers urgent care centers ascs
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
laboratories hospitals they don't
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
license um
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
a doctor's office they they just don't
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
um if it's an if it's an ambulatory
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
surgery center like concord orthopedics
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
has an ambulatory surgery center that
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
has to be licensed the doctor's office
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
per se
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
home care um hospital i mentioned
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's the difference it's just kind of
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
not a quirk but it's just you that's
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
just the way our licensing statute works
 
00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:51.990 align:start position:0%
just the way our licensing statute works
um

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
what i think this does is establish a my
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
concern is this establishes in state law
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
that the that the department would
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
actually license facilities that don't
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
take all comers that don't um accept
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
patients that can't can't pay
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
that don't accept medicaid it it just
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense to me that the
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire would support
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
that when they are
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
they they focus the department of hhs
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
focuses on trying to take care of the
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable in our population thank
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
you for your wisdom has been ahead you
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
 representative cushman
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
so as we're having this discussion um
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
what's coming to my mind is so in new
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire there's no opportunity for
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
alternative health care systems to prop
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
up that do not take medicare and
 
00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:44.950 align:start position:0%
up that do not take medicare and
medicaid

00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
so we are restricted to all of our
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know pretty much the majority except
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
direct primary care offices
 
00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:53.910 align:start position:0%
direct primary care offices
to

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
following medicare and medicaid uh the
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
centers for medicare and medicaid
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
services regulations
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
so that means that all of the health
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
care workers who were disenfranchised by
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
the biden administration cms mandate now
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
have no
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
have a very limited pool of
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
options when it comes to employment
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
is that what i'm
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:22.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire um they
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
are they have to be licensed
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
to provi as i stated all those
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
facilities if you want to open a
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
facility and again in order to ensure
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
that there's access for all
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
then they must be willing to accept um
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
care for have a charity care policy they
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
i do not and i
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
henry littman is here the director of
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
medicaid so he can answer
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
better than i i don't know that they
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
must take medicare and medicaid
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
to be a licensed health care facility i
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
have to i actually
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
they don't henry's shaking his head no
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
so they don't
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
so you're when you mention the biden
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
mandate you're referring to
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
their requirement that all
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
all facilities that actually accept
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid and medicare services ensure
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
that their
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
their staff is um
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
in order to provide safe care uh have
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
are vaccinated so again if they're
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
medicaid and medicare which all our
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
hospitals are
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
they do fall under that requirement
 
01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.910 align:start position:0%
they do fall under that requirement
follow-up

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.349 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so

01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
um it is my understanding that they are
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
required they are required to accept all
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
pay sources um so that would include
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid but um
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
subject of uh so excuse me can i answer
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
that question so a nurse practitioner
 
01:00:48.559 --> 01:00:49.270 align:start position:0%
that question so a nurse practitioner
can

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
i just ask the nurse practitioner you're
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
just you're saying what i
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
what i didn't didn't say what a nurse
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
practitioner can can practice um
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
independent in the state of new
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire so they don't need to take
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
they could practice independently right
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
but hospitals and uh ambulatory surgery
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
centers we can't do that without
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
accepting medicare and medicaid
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
we can't set up those kind of facilities
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
under this section without accepting all
 
01:01:18.319 --> 01:01:19.589 align:start position:0%
under this section without accepting all
payers

01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
payers
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
so there's no option to set up
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
alternative health care systems in new
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire that don't take
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid and therefore have
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
to follow those regulations
 
01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:31.349 align:start position:0%
to follow those regulations
so

01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
again i'd have to look at the licensing
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
regs but you do not have to you have to
 
01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.190 align:start position:0%
regs but you do not have to you have to
take

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
all comers
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
in order to be
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
a licensed healthcare facility so my
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.470 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
was

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
to the point of a mandatory charity care
 
01:01:47.359 --> 01:01:48.950 align:start position:0%
to the point of a mandatory charity care
policy

01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
i am a direct primary care consumer and
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's nothing requiring my physician
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
to have a charity care
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
option or policy in place but they do
 
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.150 align:start position:0%
option or policy in place but they do
offer

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
offer
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
a sliding scale and uh doesn't
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
the idea of a mandated charity fly in
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
the face of what charity actually is
 
01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:14.549 align:start position:0%
the face of what charity actually is
um

01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
i believe it
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
ensures access to to care for all so i
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
think i just that's my position okay the
 
01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.549 align:start position:0%
think i just that's my position okay the
chair's

01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
chair's
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
fascinated by this discussion and i'm
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
sure it will come up again and again i'm
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
not quite sure that it needs to come up
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
right now on this bill
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
so let's focus very narrowly onto this
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
bill in our questions representative gay
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
line five
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
says unless the facility exclusively
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
provides services to persons who make
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
direct payment so that would say that
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
this is not in the category we're
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
talking about a facility that is not in
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
the category that excludes charitable
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh charitable what is the right phrase
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
charitable charity care plan charity
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
care so this bill doesn't even talk
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
about establishing a facility that would
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
provide only
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
direct care and not charitable
 
01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.349 align:start position:0%
direct care and not charitable
so

01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think i think we're putting in another
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
the facility no if you read the current
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
law is the first part that's not bolded
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
adopt and enforce a written policy to
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that the facility provides its
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
services to all persons who require the
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
services regardless of their source of
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
payment that means
 
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.390 align:start position:0%
payment that means
um

01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
all that you accept all
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
and those that don't don't have
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
insurance and those that do
 
01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.150 align:start position:0%
insurance and those that do
i

01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
and there is
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill i'm just leaving
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
you may follow up yes thank you uh
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is just saying
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
to me this is this bill is saying that
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
you can provide services to people who
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
but they can't
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
do this unless they are offering
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
charitable care
 
01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.430 align:start position:0%
charitable care
i

01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not reading it that way oh these
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
double negatives are difficult so and it
 
01:04:23.039 --> 01:04:23.910 align:start position:0%
double negatives are difficult so and it
says

01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
so this is under health facilities
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
licensing statute it's a pretty big
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
statute and
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
so a piece of it is relative to
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
what representative mclean added unless
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
the facility exclusively provides
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
services to persons who make direct
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
payment for services he doesn't define
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
well he does actually a direct payment
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
is one that is paid
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
directly by the patient and is not
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursed or otherwise paid by a third
 
01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.789 align:start position:0%
reimbursed or otherwise paid by a third
party

01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:04:54.799 --> 01:04:55.829 align:start position:0%
party
so

01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
that is saying what that would mean is
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
that the facility does not have to
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
follow does not have to take all comers
 
01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
if they only do direct payments
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
and that means that you would not accept
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
medicaid medicaid and and not
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
one more i read exactly the opposite
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay because it says you would allow all
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
i can see in this bill is that you allow
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
people to come and purchase
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
a service
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
but there's two caveats one is the
 
01:05:30.799 --> 01:05:32.230 align:start position:0%
but there's two caveats one is the
facility

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
has to provide services for everybody
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
because it's exclusively
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
can't make direct payment they can't
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
just say we're only going to take people
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
who make direct payment
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
and the other caveat is that they can't
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
even have insurance where some policies
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
some of these bills that we've studied
 
01:05:51.839 --> 01:05:52.789 align:start position:0%
some of these bills that we've studied
before

01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
you could go
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
to a and pay directly and submit your
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
paperwork yourself to your insurance so
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
this has two caveats in it to me it
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's perfectly
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly fair and safe and it would not
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
impact the hospital that's trying to
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh except for their particular cost
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
their that one patient
 
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
they still have to provide charitable
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
care because
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
they can't even use a facility that
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
exclusively provides services to people
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
who make direct payment
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm going to wave off what i hoped
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
was a clarification and save it for your
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
executive session i think that's wise um
 
01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:43.839 align:start position:0%
we are and urge others to do the same
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
and i would thank you i agree with her
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative leon was next
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you again mr chairman uh
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
this looks that it's only in 151 to f1
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
the charity care is in the section too
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
do you see this applying more broadly to
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
all of the rules or simply about
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
requiring all payers because the way i'm
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
reading this you they still need to
 
01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.470 align:start position:0%
reading this you they still need to
provide

01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
they need to provide adopt publicize and
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
apply an assistance plan for persons the
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
uninsured doesn't matter in this or who
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
do not have financial resources to pay
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
for the facility services due to
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
financial hardship
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to let my testimony stand on
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair but on the wisdom of
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative weber i also wave off
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
representative canaric
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
i was actually suggested we might see if
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
somebody from dhhs might be able to
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
provide the clarity on this but
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
we went through this two years ago and i
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
have one year yeah
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative acton
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
i thank you mr chair and not thank you
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
paula again for taking our questions
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
my question is regarding the charity
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
care policy itself
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
you know in in and i was in medical i.t
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
for for 10 years so i i'm familiar with
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of this too it seems like everyone
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
i talked to outside of the system says
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
it's fundamentally broken
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
those inside the system defended um
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
rather staunchly my my concern and maybe
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong but
 
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the charity care
 
01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.309 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the charity care
policy

01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
is maybe used to shut down innovation
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
from the insiders that are already
 
01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
working to to shut down any type of new
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
innovation new offerings to uh people
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
because of this onerous charity care
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
policy is can only be handled by the big
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
guys so
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
the affordable care act and um you know
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
believes that all everyone should have
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
access to services and hospitals support
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
that and believe
 
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
robust charity care policies for all
 
01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.709 align:start position:0%
robust charity care policies for all
facilities

01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that there is no um
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
cherry-picking of um of those that are
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
unable to afford care so we we support
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
charity care policies for all and i'm
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
going to thank ms minahan for her coming
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
up here and then i'm going to call on
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
greg moore from americans for prosperity
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to come up and he's
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
committee

01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is greg moore i'm
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
the state director with americans for
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
prosperity in new hampshire and i'm here
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of house bill
 
01:09:32.719 --> 01:09:34.309 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of house bill
1044.

01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
1044.
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
um first i want to acknowledge the
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor and he is like a dog with uh
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
bone with this particular
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation um he
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
he will get on top of you and
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
we support this legislation frankly we
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
would support much broader deregulatory
 
01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.470 align:start position:0%
would support much broader deregulatory
uh

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
work in this space but we do believe
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
that as a former speaker once told me
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
that if he hit enough singles you score
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
still score runs so i think this is a
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
positive step
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
i think there's a little bit of a lot of
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
questions raised so i think there's a
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
lot of history that that
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
probably should be raised in terms of
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
context so that the committee
 
01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
context so that the committee
understands

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
understands
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh back prior to 2016
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
we had what's known as a health
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
facilities review and licensing board
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
which we
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
most people will call a certificate of
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
need board we had what we call the con
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
board prior to 2016.
 
01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.270 align:start position:0%
board prior to 2016.
and

01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
that con board basically served as a
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
boardware if someone wanted to get a
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
a facility wanted to open a facility
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
they would go to this board they would
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
petition this board in order to get what
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
amounts to a permission slip in order to
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
open a facility
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
that the process to on why not began in
 
01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.510 align:start position:0%
that the process to on why not began in
2011

01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
2011
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
when the legislature passed a law to
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
phase out the certificate of need board
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
that was brought at the behest of one
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
particular provider who wanted to come
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
into this state that's the cancer
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
treatment centers of america um and and
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
whether you like the certificate of need
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
board dislike the certificate board it
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
was definitely a bulky and cumbersome
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
process when i was working as a director
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
at dhhs
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is back in the pleistocene era that
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
only i think representative mcmahon and
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative mckay may remember um i
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
actually had a chance to participate in
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
a number of these uh health facility
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
review and licensing uh committee
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
meetings the uh the bottom line is the
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
bottom line is is that the legislation
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
made the decision in 2011 to
 
01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
unwind the certificate of need board
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
and in the process of unwinding a
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
certificate of need board there was
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
legislation that was brought forward
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
in 2016 that that created this section
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
right here so that's how we got to where
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
we are in terms of in terms of the
 
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:43.430 align:start position:0%
we are in terms of in terms of the
timing

01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
timing
 
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.229 align:start position:0%
timing
um

01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i remember that the process to
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
unwind in 2011 because i was working for
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
the house at the time so that was that
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
was uh that was a process to to get
 
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.630 align:start position:0%
was uh that was a process to to get
there

01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.590 align:start position:0%
there
our

01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
medical needs are evolving very quickly
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
particularly after 2014 with sort of the
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
implementation of the affordable care
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
act which basically has changed the
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
healthcare landscape
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
one of the consequences of which here in
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is we have a number of
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
people who have these high deductible
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
health plan bills
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
health plan
 
01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.470 align:start position:0%
health plan
insurance

01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
and as well as some other health care
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
innovations like direct primary care
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
which is an evolving subject i know
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative folsom mentioned her
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
friend who has that
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
and certainly enough people some people
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
are beginning to go that route uh
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
typically what you get with a with a
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
concierge care or direct primary care
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
treatment plan is you get a high
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
deductible health plan i.e a
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
catastrophic policy on top of your your
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
concierge care direct primary care
 
01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.390 align:start position:0%
concierge care direct primary care
payment

01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
payment
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
and so what is creating is an
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
environment here in the state where we
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
have a large number of people having
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
these hierarchical health plans
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
according to new hampshire business
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
review new hampshire has the highest
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
usage on a percentage basis of high
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
deductible health plans and perhaps more
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
concerningly they have uh they have uh
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
the the highest deductibles among family
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
plans of any state in the nation so we
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people who have these
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
plans and sometimes they have
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
direct primary care underneath them
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes they have
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
an hsa underneath them but frankly
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
there's often a big gap between what
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
you're paying out of pocket before you
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
hit that cap
 
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.229 align:start position:0%
hit that cap
so

01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
i know representative mclean is looking
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
for solutions to try to solve for that
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
problem i think he might have a high
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
deductible health plan so i think he's
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
walked a mile in these shoes so i think
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
he's looking for opportunities for more
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
transparency as well as an opportunity
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
to allow people to offer more affordable
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
care for people who are paying up until
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
they hit that that i mean after they hit
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
after you hit your cap you become fairly
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
price insensitive right because then the
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
insurance company is going to carry the
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
rest of the rest of the load but up
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
until you hit that point there is
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
definitely a case in which you can be
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
paying five ten thousand dollars out of
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
your pocket which is a significant
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
impact for a lot of people and i will
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
just tell you at a personal level as
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
someone who's in the public policy run
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of polling this is a
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
consistently top three issue the the
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
cost of health care among new hampshire
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
citizens so
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
what house bill 1044 is looking to do is
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
to try to create a vehicle outside of
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
the regulation that was created in 2016
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
to allow for people to have have
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
facilities and again facilities are a
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
whole host of things that the department
 
01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.510 align:start position:0%
whole host of things that the department
licenses

01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's medical imaging like mri
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
and cat scans or lab work uh there were
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that would come in at a
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
price point well below
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
what what people who are taking these
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
high deductible health plans are would
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
see and they would benefit from a more
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
transparent lower cost alternative
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
as they as they go about doing this i
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
will tell you that as representative
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
leon pointed out
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
affects section one of 152 151 2f it
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
does not affect section 2 relative to
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
charity care that's still in place
 
01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.590 align:start position:0%
charity care that's still in place
and

01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
one of the other things i think to the
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
point representative dr konnick pointed
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
out about critical access hospitals this
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
does not affect um
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
this does not affect
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh 198.2
 
01:15:16.239 --> 01:15:17.189 align:start position:0%
uh 198.2
uh

01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
198 colon 2 which is that 15 mile radius
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
surrounding a critical access hospital
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh so that that still would be intact so
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
that this would be unchanged in order to
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
build a facility within that 15 mile
 
01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.510 align:start position:0%
build a facility within that 15 mile
radius

01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
radius
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
you would still have to go through the
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
198.2 process in order to be able to to
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
get that so
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
allowing the for these direct
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
direct payment model of facilities
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
that you would still you still just
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't drop it into that 15 mile
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
radius so they would still have those
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
protections so i think it's important to
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
address that because i think that was an
 
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
issue that was raised a year ago and i
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
think but i think that that the
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
legislature has taken a pathway to
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
protect those critical access hospitals
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
and it is that 198 to
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
protections that are in there and this
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change any of that so
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
what this bill does i think
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
no one's going to build a direct payment
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
hospital no one's building a
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
acute care hospital and says we're only
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
going to take cash
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
i think what you're looking at are those
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
facilities that are again under what
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
we're seeing these high deductible
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
health plans capped at and i think so i
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
think what you're looking at are lab lab
 
01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:30.470 align:start position:0%
think what you're looking at are lab lab
work

01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
some medical imaging and maybe like a
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy i think that's probably the
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
sum total of what you're seeing because
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
as i said once people hit those caps
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
of their high deductible health plan
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
they become fairly price insensitive and
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
so that i think is
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
is an important thing to consider as
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
well and i've already talked for quite a
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
long time so i'd be happy to take any
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.270 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much and thanks for
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
pointing out the 198.2 i i served on the
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
committee that worked on that
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
bill the thing that you kept making
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
comments about high deductible health
 
01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.350 align:start position:0%
comments about high deductible health
plans

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
plans
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
but i thought we all agreed that this
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
was only if the person was paying
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
directly for services
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
and so therefore that's totally
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
irrelevant because it's not going you
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
know if you have a hydrational health
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
plan you've got a health plan
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
the way you meet your deductible is
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
you've got to submit those charges to
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
your insurance they don't cover them
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
but you're still submitting them if you
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
don't submit them then that high
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
deductible still sits there because it's
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
not getting whittled away it gets
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
whittled away as your as your
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
dem as your requirement or your payment
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
your bill does not get paid by the
 
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
insurance that's your cost sharing
 
01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.830 align:start position:0%
insurance that's your cost sharing
so

01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
that argument doesn't carry any weight
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
this is for people who are going to walk
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
in and play what we used to call cash on
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
the barrel
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to walk in and say i i want
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
to do this so
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the 15 mile thing but i
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
have to confess for those of us in the
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
north country we drive over 15 miles to
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
get anywhere for anything
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
and with that in mind uh the even though
 
01:18:02.719 --> 01:18:03.510 align:start position:0%
and with that in mind uh the even though
that

01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
helped a lot with the
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
urgent care type of setting
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
and that's a lot what that 1982 is about
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
do you still not think that there would
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
be a potential that we are going to skim
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
off the high revenue producing
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
patients from a
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
from critical access hospitals who are
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
running on razor thin margins or in the
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
red as their normal
 
01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.149 align:start position:0%
red as their normal
situation

01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
and leave them without the revenue just
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
with the lower revenue or the charity
 
01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.590 align:start position:0%
with the lower revenue or the charity
care

01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
for you thank you for the question uh so
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
as the first part of the payments to a
 
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.149 align:start position:0%
as the first part of the payments to a
facility

01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
the payments to a facility that took
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
direct payment only
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
would still be able to add up to your
 
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.229 align:start position:0%
would still be able to add up to your
deductible

01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
but your insurance company isn't going
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
to know about that it is not going to
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
credit you to your deductible because
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
the way it gets credited to your
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
deductible is that it is submitted to
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
the insurer
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
they refuse to pay it because it's under
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
your deductible
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
i will say that that other states that
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
have offered cash only models have not
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
seen that experience
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
um but to your
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
to your your question about uh about the
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals i've certainly
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time working through that
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
when i was when i was with the
 
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.630 align:start position:0%
when i was when i was with the
department

01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.510 align:start position:0%
department
um

01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
obviously they get enhanced medicare
 
01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.390 align:start position:0%
obviously they get enhanced medicare
reimbursement

01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.270 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
um

01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
they've been taken care of from the
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
medicaid side as well um and they get
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
some enhanced reimbursements there so
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
that they're they're getting um a number
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
of enhancements
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
but i would say that the policy the
 
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
legislature has set for protecting
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals is the 198
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
cohen ii that is a policy that
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
that this committee and the legislature
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
as a whole has taken and i i think that
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
you either have a policy or or then your
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
policy is wrong
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and you
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
then then you find ways to adjust 198
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
too but
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
i would say that that there are a lot of
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
other areas in the state in the southern
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
tier of the state that frankly could
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
benefit from having a new opportunity
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
that ultimately
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
would be harmed by not having that
 
01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.110 align:start position:0%
would be harmed by not having that
opportunity

01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
and my advice to you is that if you're
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
concerned about the critical access
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
piece would be to
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
bring some legislation relative to 198
 
01:20:26.719 --> 01:20:29.270 align:start position:0%
bring some legislation relative to 198
too

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.830 align:start position:0%
 
follow

01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
up have to do with special uh license
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
facilities those are
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
mega voltage radiation and freestanding
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
radiology and so on i was thinking that
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:50.229 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's just special health care services
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
so it's broader than hospitals
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
but the critical access designation
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
which which comes from the from the from
 
01:21:00.239 --> 01:21:01.669 align:start position:0%
which which comes from the from the from
cms

01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
cms
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
um actually i think 198 statute has to
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
do with school money i think we got the
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
wrong number i do know which one you're
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
talking about but i'm blanking on the
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
number right now oh okay i i apologize i
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
was reading reading a title from from
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 481 it is rsa 151 for
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.639 --> 01:21:42.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
and as you can see in the the
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
certification it's a cfr which means
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's a federal designation
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's in uh bullet six
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
yes but if i recall
 
01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.629 align:start position:0%
yes but if i recall
okay

01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we might we probably should
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
do this offline because we're wasting
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
time during the hearing yep um so thank
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
you though so
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and also thank you
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
because i asked the same question that i
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
asked miss minahan
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
i first of all commend what you're
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
trying to do as far as greater
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
consumerism and health care and trying
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
to bring down the cost healthcare i just
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if this is the way to go
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
about doing it
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
my concern is and the question to you is
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
that what is to guarantee that when a
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
patient goes into a cash paying only
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
facility that they will actually pay
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
less than going to another facility that
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have only cash paying customers
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
number two
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
when you have a patient today who can go
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
on to many websites
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
and decide like i think representative
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
lima delemus did you can go on and look
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
for different
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
rates and prices if you will today so as
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
a cash paying customer with a high
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
deductible today
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
i can go out and look at what the lab's
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
going to charge what the
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
mri is going to be and so forth and do
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's funny i was working in 2004 at the
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
department when we put together the
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
health healthcare pricing and
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
transparency um website with the
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
department of insurance it was a joint
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
effort between the two
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that that is a dramatically
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
underutilized tool
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
that said i would say that
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
if you're going to take cash
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
then it's not it's necessary that you
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
have to be completely transparent about
 
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
what your costs are
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the point of of earlier speakers
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
there may be a charge master but how
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
much you're paying is going to be a
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
direct relationship to
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
your insurance company of the new deal
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
they've negotiated with the facility
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
or medicare or medicaid
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
although those folks don't usually pay
 
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket costs but but if you're if
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
you are insured
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
if you are insured
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
that the amount you will pay will vary
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
can vary quite widely from the charge
 
01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.830 align:start position:0%
can vary quite widely from the charge
master

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
master
 
01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:06.229 align:start position:0%
master
follow-up

01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you my understanding is on the
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
website i'd be wrong about this
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
but there's also a list there for
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
self-pay what the cash price would be if
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
you're paying it in cash so therefore if
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
i'm a
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
paying customer
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
i have access to the data today to make
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
an intelligent choice without going
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
through a change in legislation uh yes
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
and that and that actually is to your
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
earlier point which is that if there
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
were facilities that took direct payment
 
01:24:30.159 --> 01:24:31.510 align:start position:0%
were facilities that took direct payment
only

01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
you could go and compare their prices
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
with uh with the prices of other other
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
more traditional facilities so you would
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
have that ability and again i think that
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
i tell people all the time which is that
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
website is dramatically underused and i
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
and and frankly if you saw that that a
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
more traditional facility could offer a
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
better price to a cash-only payment i
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
would say that i would say that that
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's great too
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
i think i think giving consumers more
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
options is a great thing
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
the chair has asked
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
house committee services if they would
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
do some research prior to our executing
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
this bill as to what other states are
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
doing on the same thing and they
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
responded that they would be doing such
 
01:25:14.639 --> 01:25:15.910 align:start position:0%
responded that they would be doing such
research

01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
research
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
moore for
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh so concerning the
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
15-mile rule
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
and the idea
 
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.110 align:start position:0%
and the idea
of

01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
lowering payments
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
looking at this from a free market
 
01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.990 align:start position:0%
looking at this from a free market
perspective

01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.030 align:start position:0%
perspective
the

01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
decreased administrative costs of not
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
having to
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
provide insurance and have that overhead
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
would likely result in lower prices for
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
the consumer it may not guarantee that
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
they would be lower than surrounding
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
areas but
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
knowing that there is that price
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
comparison it would incentivize those
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
price those
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
facilities to offer lower prices and
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that couldn't that be a benefit
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
for people in the north country
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
especially when there would be a charity
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
yes downward price pressure always helps
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
consumers i think that's that's just
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
makes sense uh
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
but i i would say that i would say that
 
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:18.950 align:start position:0%
but i i would say that i would say that
uh

01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
there has been there have been some
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
studies done that showed that medical
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
billing and other overhead costs can
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
amount to up to 35 of health care costs
 
01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
so that's an overhead that everyone has
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
to carry there's a
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
a trade group for independent physicians
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
that recommends for each individual
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
physician that they have
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh two assistants to focus on things
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
like billing
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
so think about that kind of overhead
 
01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.070 align:start position:0%
so think about that kind of overhead
versus

01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
versus uh the
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
sorry opportunities uh opportunities
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps to get outside of that system
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
and lose that overhead and you could
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
so to get back to the specifics of this
 
01:27:02.719 --> 01:27:04.070 align:start position:0%
so to get back to the specifics of this
bill

01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
am i correct in thinking that all that
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
contrary to what was implied
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
by the previous questioner
 
01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.270 align:start position:0%
by the previous questioner
currently

01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
all the facilities with this kind of
 
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.709 align:start position:0%
all the facilities with this kind of
license

01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
have to have a charity care policy
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does
 
01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
is it exempts
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
these are the words on the page here
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
what's already in statute the stuff
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's not in bold says that every
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
facility with this kind of license
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
has to adopt and enforce a written
 
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.390 align:start position:0%
has to adopt and enforce a written
policy

01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.350 align:start position:0%
policy
uh

01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
that that the to assure that the
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
facility provides a services to all
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
persons who require the services
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of the source of payment
 
01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.830 align:start position:0%
regardless of the source of payment
um

01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
for services provided to everybody so
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
they have to have a charity policy
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
that's what the law is now
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
because that's the stuff that's not in
 
01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.709 align:start position:0%
because that's the stuff that's not in
bold

01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
bold
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
all that this does is it exempts from
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
that policy
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
the requirement to provide charity
 
01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.669 align:start position:0%
the requirement to provide charity
services

01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
it exempts those services who
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
are pure cash only
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
services so isn't it true
 
01:28:31.199 --> 01:28:32.310 align:start position:0%
services so isn't it true
that

01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
the savings
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
let me back up a bit um
 
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.189 align:start position:0%
let me back up a bit um
what

01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
what what they're
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get at
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
is two kinds of savings one is
 
01:28:50.639 --> 01:28:51.910 align:start position:0%
is two kinds of savings one is
uh

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
not having to
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
have the billing personnel available to
 
01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.430 align:start position:0%
have the billing personnel available to
uh

01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.550 align:start position:0%
uh
do

01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
all the billing and the 550 000 billing
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
codes and they also get the savings of
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
not having to take people who don't pay
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
so that's what this bill does it exempts
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
simply exempts the facilities
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
that only take direct pay so it's only
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
for one
 
01:29:19.199 --> 01:29:21.669 align:start position:0%
for one
specific

01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
business model
 
01:29:23.679 --> 01:29:25.270 align:start position:0%
business model
within

01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
this group of licensees is that correct
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
as far as the first one i guess broadly
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
to simplify this bill right now if you
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to open a facility a health care
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
facility which is
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
the whole list you could go regardless
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
of the type of facility regardless of
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
the type of facility if you wanted to
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
open one that took direct payments only
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
it would be illegal in the state of new
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire so this legislation would
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
legalize your ability to open a facility
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
to do that as far as the charity care
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
that the language of the bill only
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
includes section one of rsa
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
151 2f
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
because section 2 of that very same
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
statute reads that in order to get a
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
facilities license in other words in
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
order to get a license from dhhs to open
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
a facility you must adopt publicize and
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
apply an assistance plan for persons who
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
are uninsured uninsured or who do not
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
have financial resources to pay a
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
facility of service due to financial
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
hardship this legislation does not touch
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
does not touch that statute okay so
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
what section one is so that's section
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
two what section one is is
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh again back um back in 2011 when the
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
cancer treatment centers of america
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to come into new hampshire
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
um and when they wanted uh to
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
basically get rid of the certificate
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
need board which again took took five
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
a little historical context is
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
is that the cancer treatment centers of
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
america do not take
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
all payers and i think that there was a
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
great concern that ctca
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
would come into new hampshire and put a
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
lot of pressure on the other oncology
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
providers across the state and so
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
my impression sitting through the the
 
01:31:20.639 --> 01:31:21.350 align:start position:0%
my impression sitting through the the
the

01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
sitting through the
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
for the senate bill 481 hearings and the
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
discussion surrounding it was that it
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
was in part to ensure that that one
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
provider not come to the state of new
 
01:31:30.719 --> 01:31:32.629 align:start position:0%
provider not come to the state of new
hampshire

01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
in fact it was said that fairly
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
explicitly on the senate side
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
it is the chair's belief that the last
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
question and the answer to it
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
spoke directly to the bill
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
we've gone down various quite
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
interesting but time-consuming bunny
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
trails so now i'm going to thank you mr
 
01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:57.120 align:start position:0%

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.189 align:start position:0%
hearing to a close
and

01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%

we are very late and i apologize for
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
having a very slow gavel on
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
bunny trails
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
we now
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on house bill 1526
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
relative to income eligibility for in
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
and out medical assistance the chair
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prime sponsor our very
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
own representative snow and i would say
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
to someone in the public the only part
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the pink card you did not fill out
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
was your name
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to walk it down yes thank
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
you so while representative snow comes
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you members of the committee
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
for your patience i'm sorry about my
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
late arrival today but it was for
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
unavoidable circumstances and i'm glad
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
that i was able to get here before the
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
bill actually began
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
this is house bill 1626 and it reads
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
that this is relative to the income
 
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility for in and out medicaid
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
i thought before we began talking about
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
this bill there are some new members of
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
this committee that weren't here last
 
01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.149 align:start position:0%
this committee that weren't here last
year

01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
when we looked at the original bill
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
which was 1639
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
and that was a bill about in and out
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
medicaid and adjusting
 
01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:40.950 align:start position:0%
medicaid and adjusting
the

01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
the income eligibility for that
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
particular benefit that was affordable
 
01:33:49.110 --> 01:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
what the what we were seeking to do was
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
to find a way for persons
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
low-income persons
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
who were uninsured
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
who had income that was slightly above
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
the maximum income eligibility threshold
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
as standard in other words they earned
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit too much or quite a
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
than what the income eligibility would
 
01:34:08.639 --> 01:34:09.510 align:start position:0%
than what the income eligibility would
allow

01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
however they also had ongoing medical
 
01:34:12.239 --> 01:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
however they also had ongoing medical
expenses

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
and uh that were medicaid eligible if
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
they had medicaid
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
that went well beyond the what they
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
could afford to pay out of the income
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
that they had at this time
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
this has been in place for a number of
 
01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
this has been in place for a number of
years

01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
and it's worked out extremely well
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
however the one factor about it is the
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
that maximum income eligibility
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
is set at for a single individual
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
is set at 591 dollars a month
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
which means that if you were under 591
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
dollars a month you're automatically
 
01:34:49.119 --> 01:34:50.229 align:start position:0%
dollars a month you're automatically
eligible

01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
for that service however if your income
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
goes a little over that
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
and yet you have expensive medical
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
expenses what this bill allows you to do
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
is to spend down on those expenses that
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
you now
 
01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:03.590 align:start position:0%
you now
incur

01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
incur
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
until you reach that threshold and from
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
that point on you do receive the
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
medicaid benefits for the rest of the
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
month when we passed 1636
 
01:35:14.159 --> 01:35:14.950 align:start position:0%
month when we passed 1636
the

01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
income eligibility we worked closely
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
with the department of health and human
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
services this committee did and others
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
to come up with a new threshold the new
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
threshold and i'm not going to talk
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
about larger numbers i think if we want
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
to get into details about that we can
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
have the people from health and human
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
services answer that but i'm going to
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
just talk about the single individual
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
the threshold for them went from 591 up
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
to 901 dollars a month
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
that means that what we were saying is
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
that people who fell in between
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
those two things if they were earned
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
more than 591 but now earned less
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
than 901
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible to be moved from
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
the medicaid in and out program
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
into the regular medicaid program and
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
turned over to one of the three managed
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
care companies that manage the benefits
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
under the medicare program and that has
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
been seen by this body and the
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
department is a more effective way to
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
manage medicaid programs under the in
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
and out they're still operating on a
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
fee-for-service basis because that's
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
really the only way they can do it
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
what with this bill is when when we
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
passed this it by the way
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
1639 was passed by this body
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
in fact it was the lead bill
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
in that whole health care bill
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
that went
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
went to the
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to be determined
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2.
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 and considering it
 
01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
liked the bill i think i hope from what
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
i understand they like the bill but felt
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
they couldn't afford it so what they did
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
was they suspended the additional money
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
didn't change the bill it still remained
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
with the old
 
01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:11.590 align:start position:0%
with the old
threshold

01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
but they said for the next biennium the
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
old threshold would take place
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
what we're attempting to do when we work
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
on house bill
 
01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:22.629 align:start position:0%
on house bill
um

01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:22.639 --> 01:37:23.669 align:start position:0%
um
15

01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:37:23.679 --> 01:37:25.270 align:start position:0%
15
26

01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
26
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
is to seek
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
a repeal of that suspension for the
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
second year of this biennium
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
so we can move from the 5 91 threshold
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
to the 901 for the second year and then
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
according to the statute it
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
automatically goes to the new thing at
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the next biennium which
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
was what it was originally called for so
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
that's relatively simple
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to spend an awful lot of
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
time on it because the detail work
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
i i have to applaud the staff from
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
health and human services henry lippman
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
and his staff did a phenomenal job in
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
working with us and working this out and
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
there's a fountain of information when
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
you ask i know where he stores all that
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
information and he's he's also got what
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
do you call it
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
when you can call up information and it
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
just comes right away
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
he's got yeah he's really got that in
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
his head
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
in any case uh
 
01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
i think one of the things that we need
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
to understand is under the old thing it
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
was a real burden for many of the uh
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
for many of the uh
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
clients that we serve
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
they become very anxious when they're
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
not sure if they're in or out with their
 
01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.910 align:start position:0%
not sure if they're in or out with their
benefits

01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
when am i going to be qualified to get
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
my benefits
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
this for them would solve that anxiety
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
that they might experience and also
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
the other is it creates a huge problem
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
for the providers of services for people
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
with severe and persistent mental
 
01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:52.870 align:start position:0%
with severe and persistent mental
illness

01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
illness
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
and there's a
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
large number of them that are on the in
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
and out program of the people are on in
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
and out for a variety of different
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
reasons they all aren't because of
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
mental illness there are a lot number of
 
01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.430 align:start position:0%
mental illness there are a lot number of
other

01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
medical problems that can
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
be brought into being for that and i
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't have really any information about
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
that but they would but there was a
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
there's about 2500 people with severe
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
and persistent mental illness that the
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers are
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
required to provide service to under a
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
contract that we have and that we have
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
to serve them or they have to serve them
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of their ability to pay
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
so when people are out of their benefit
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
the mental health centers have to
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
continue to provide all their services
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
until they reach that threshold
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
and then from that point on
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
they are able to collect
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
now you need to understand when they're
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
in the out part of it when they're not
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're not only losing the state money
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's part of medicaid we're also
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
losing that 50
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
federal share
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
and in 2019 and i believe last year i
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the exact figures for last
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
year but i can't imagine that it went
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
down last year with all that's going on
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
in mental health
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
the mental health centers lost over
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars
 
01:40:06.719 --> 01:40:08.149 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars
in

01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
bad debt
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
that they had to eat as part of their
 
01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:12.870 align:start position:0%
that they had to eat as part of their
budget

01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would substantially reduce
 
01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.750 align:start position:0%
this bill would substantially reduce
that

01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
by taking and the estimate is and the
 
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
best estimate we can come up with is
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 30 and 40 percent of
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
the people that are now
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
being treated uh
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
within and out would automatically move
 
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
over because their income would now be
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
below that 901
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
they would automatically shift over to
 
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
that fif to that managed care option
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
with medicaid
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
which in a lot of ways is is much better
 
01:40:43.199 --> 01:40:44.149 align:start position:0%
which in a lot of ways is is much better
and

01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
that that would substantially reduce the
 
01:40:47.590 --> 01:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
amount of bad debt that these another
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
that work with these people
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
that aren't affected by this pharmacies
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
cannot fill prescriptions for people
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
unless they have the cash to pay for it
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
so imagine the trickery of being a
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
client and knowing you have to pick up a
 
01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:09.109 align:start position:0%
client and knowing you have to pick up a
prescription

01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the challenge to mental health
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
centers if some these are people who are
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
often requiring rather intensive
 
01:41:14.639 --> 01:41:16.229 align:start position:0%
often requiring rather intensive
services

01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
to help them maintain a level of
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
recovery that's optimal for them
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
and often they have to take medications
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
to control the symptoms that make it
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to achieve that
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
some of these medications are extremely
 
01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:32.070 align:start position:0%
some of these medications are extremely
expensive

01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
so mental health centers and others that
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
provide services have to look at how can
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
we be sure
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
that the majority of these prescriptions
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
are written during a period of time when
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
they're on the in part of the medicaid
 
01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:45.510 align:start position:0%
they're on the in part of the medicaid
program

01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
when we have to do like with a new
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
client when we're not sure
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
then you really have to hustle sometimes
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
you're looking for free samples from
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
sales people sometimes you're looking
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
for help from the actual drug company
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes you'll look for alternatives
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a tricky business
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
and requires a lot of staff time and a
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
lot of frustration i worked in this
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
field for 48 years i've been retired for
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
eight i'm very glad i don't have to deal
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
with this kind of a problem every day
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
from now on but we have some people here
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
today that are continuing to deal with
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
this and i think they're
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
in a much better position to speak to
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
the frustration that providers feel both
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:42:25.119 --> 01:42:26.310 align:start position:0%
because of
the

01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:28.149 --> 01:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
loss in debt and also the problems
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
caused by other providers
 
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:30.950 align:start position:0%
caused by other providers
uh

01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
i i think at this point i'm just trying
 
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
to think if there's any other very
 
01:42:34.239 --> 01:42:35.430 align:start position:0%
to think if there's any other very
important

01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
points that i should make at this point
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
i think there are people in this
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
audience that are in a much better
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
position to answer your questions
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
than than me and so i'm gonna
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
maybe i didn't cut a chart i'm known as
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
a big talker but
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
in any case i do think i will
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
sit down but i really ask for your
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
consideration this is a group of people
 
01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
people with
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
severe and persistent mental illness
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
is a group that i've worked with all of
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
my career and i worked i was a social
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
worker in
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
mental health field for 50 years
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
these are people
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
who i have developed a great deal of
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
respect for
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
they are people who are strong
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
they're persistent
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
and they're dealing in a circumstance
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
in a world beginning to understand
 
01:43:24.639 --> 01:43:27.430 align:start position:0%
in a world beginning to understand
what

01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
the world they're living in stigma has
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
improved substantially in the last few
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
years but ladies and gentlemen we got a
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
long way to go to have these people be
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
being an equal footing with all the rest
 
01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
of us that suffer various illnesses i
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
have very little stigma because i have
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
to walk around on a walker
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
but i have if i have problems with
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
chronic depression that stigma still
 
01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:50.550 align:start position:0%
chronic depression that stigma still
exists

01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
exists
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
this will be a big step towards helping
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
them move ahead in that and i'm getting
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
the high side for my chairman and i
 
01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
should be quiet and i will
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
so much we are honored to have you in
 
01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
our committee with your years and
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
decades of experience
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
are you yielding questions i will be
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions but i do think
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
technical questions are much better
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
directed towards mr lipman or i did see
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the audience uh the director from
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
lakes region would that be the mr
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
lippman who is in the process of filling
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
out a pink card i hope it is yes
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
we should have a standing order on a
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
pink card well maybe i think maybe
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe i should have referred to
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
usually i check with him first but mr
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
lipman is the man that i've
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
that i've dealt with over the phone and
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
in meetings all the way along
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
before we get to him though i'm going to
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm going to ask for holly
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
stevens to come up
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
can we do that
 
01:44:54.149 --> 01:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
from nami she's moved she's going to
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
give us a news update on her new job
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
do you want
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%

here today um in support of house bill
1526

01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
1526
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative snow did a great job in
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
describing what this bill would do and
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
it is a bill that was passed
 
01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:09.510 align:start position:0%
it is a bill that was passed
um

01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
and then was
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
suspended last year and i just want to
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
say that this was a great exercise in
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
legal research with me trying to figure
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
out all the moving parts of what was
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
going on with this bill
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
as far as repealing a suspension but
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
that is what it's doing it's repealing
 
01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
the suspension
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
that was passed last year
 
01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
that was passed last year
and

01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
according to
 
01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.870 align:start position:0%
according to
the

01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
analysis and fiscal note that the
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
department did
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
in october of 2021 there were
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
granite staters that were subject to
 
01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:48.229 align:start position:0%
granite staters that were subject to
this

01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
income spend down
 
01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:51.910 align:start position:0%
income spend down
and

01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
about and not about 998 of those
 
01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:56.550 align:start position:0%
about and not about 998 of those
individuals

01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
so about one-fifth
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
would no longer be subject to it if
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
the increase were to go into effect and
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's i mean it seems like a small
 
01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:07.350 align:start position:0%
that's i mean it seems like a small
number

01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
but to those 998 people this is huge
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
um as representative snow mentioned many
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
of these folks live with severe and
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
persistent mental illness
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
and they require monthly services
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
through the community mental health
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
centers or other mental health providers
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
many of them do require prescriptions
 
01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.709 align:start position:0%
many of them do require prescriptions
and

01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
if they
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
aren't able to obtain their
 
01:49:33.599 --> 01:49:35.350 align:start position:0%
aren't able to obtain their
prescriptions

01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
then they could require services that
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
are a lot more costly than those
 
01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:43.510 align:start position:0%
are a lot more costly than those
prescriptions

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
in the past when i worked for new
 
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
futures my my testimony concentrated a
 
01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:49.189 align:start position:0%
futures my my testimony concentrated a
lot

01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
lot
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
on the providers who were providing
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
these services
 
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
they would
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
give the bills
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
to the patients the patients would bring
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
those bills to the department of human
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
this they would then turn on medicaid
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
but the community mental health centers
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
would never receive payment for those
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
services that were provided
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
but in addition to that
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
there are a number of individuals with
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
severe and persistent mental illness
 
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
who don't go and
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
get their treatment in the beginning of
 
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
the month um
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that they feel like
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it because they don't
 
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:30.870 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it because they don't
have

01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
medicaid at that time
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
and they have to spend down
 
01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.350 align:start position:0%
and they have to spend down
with

01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
medical bills
 
01:50:39.199 --> 01:50:40.270 align:start position:0%
medical bills
to

01:50:40.270 --> 01:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
591 dollars for an individual
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
591 dollars is essentially what they
 
01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:49.270 align:start position:0%
591 dollars is essentially what they
have

01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
in their pocket to live on for that
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
month to pay rent utilities
 
01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:57.030 align:start position:0%
month to pay rent utilities
food

01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
food
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
any other necessities that they need and
 
01:51:03.070 --> 01:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
this would raise that to as you heard
 
01:51:05.669 --> 01:51:05.679 align:start position:0%
901 dollars
 
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
there was a 2021 new hampshire
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
residential rental cost survey report
 
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:18.080 align:start position:0%

01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes there's point six the point six
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
percent of occupancy rate
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
um so you it is difficult to find them
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
but when you look at that it's fourteen
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
hundred and ninety eight dollars per
 
01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:40.229 align:start position:0%
hundred and ninety eight dollars per
month

01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
for rent
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
and this increase would allow people
 
01:51:45.599 --> 01:51:46.550 align:start position:0%
and this increase would allow people
to

01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
have essentially 901
 
01:51:49.679 --> 01:51:50.709 align:start position:0%
have essentially 901
so

01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
when you look at that it's 901 is not a
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
lot of money
 
01:51:57.119 --> 01:51:57.990 align:start position:0%
lot of money
um

01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:02.669 --> 01:52:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
591 dollars
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
and even for the individuals who
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
would still be subject to the in and out
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't move to the managed care
 
01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:15.589 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't move to the managed care
the

01:52:15.589 --> 01:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:19.599 --> 01:52:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
there's

01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
575 that would still
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
5075 that are still in the in and out
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
program but for those individuals
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
they would only have to spend down to
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
the 901
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
which means they have an additional 300
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
or so in their pockets
 
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
in order to pay for gas
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
in order to pay for those prescriptions
 
01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:45.679 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the month things of
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
that nature um
 
01:52:48.239 --> 01:52:51.189 align:start position:0%
that nature um
so

01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to the monetary cost you've
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
got the administrative burdens you've
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
got you know not only administrative
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
burdens for the providers
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
who don't know exactly when
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
their patients are turned on and off
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
they have to actually
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
check daily to see whether somebody's
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
medicaid has been turned on during the
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
month or whether it's still off but
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
there's a huge administrative burden for
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
the patients
 
01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:20.870 align:start position:0%
the patients
um

01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
you know they have to hold on to every
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
single bill
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
so that they can bring those to the
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
department or send those to the
 
01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:28.709 align:start position:0%
department or send those to the
department

01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
in order to show their spend down
 
01:53:32.239 --> 01:53:33.270 align:start position:0%
in order to show their spend down
um

01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
and i know just for myself you know
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
collecting my own medical bills
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
is is uh it's a process you know and
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
having to keep them all in one place and
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
then and then get them to the department
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
in order to get your medicaid turned on
 
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
and they have to do this every single
 
01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.550 align:start position:0%
and they have to do this every single
month

01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
um so again you know this this all this
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
bill does is repeals the suspension um
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
that was passed last year this is a bill
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
that had bipartisan support
 
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
back when it was originally
 
01:54:10.870 --> 01:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
passed and was supported by the senate
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%

good morning and thank you and i'm going
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
to be very brief because god bless you

for sitting here this long on this kind
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
of detail i will tell you that house
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
bill 526 i am a
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
ceo of the mental health center up in
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
laconia and plymouth it's called lakes
 
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
region mental health and i'm the
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
treasurer of the community behavioral
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
health association
 
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
i am here in support of this bill
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
because it does lift the suspension for
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
which we would be able to move the
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
needle a little bit for poor people
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
make no mistake this isn't just about
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
people who have severe and persistent
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
mental illness this is about poor people
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
needing access to health care and the
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
way they can do that is to be able to
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
have enough money to have insurance to
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
pay for their health care if you have
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars a month to spend
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
and you need asthma medicine or you need
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
anything else and you have to spend the
 
01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
other dollars that you have in your
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
pocket on that do you pick that or do
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
you pick food for your belly do you pick
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
that or do you pick a better apartment
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
with lights and heat that work
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
so i just want to implore that you lift
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
the suspension and that you think about
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
the access this creates for poor people
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
to get health insurance when they need
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
it and not have to make terrible
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
decisions about whether to take medicine
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
or get the health care that they need or
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
end up in a costly emergency room
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
because they didn't get what they needed
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and if you have any questions
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer them but i just
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to be quick and say this is like
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
motherhood and apple pie you should do
 
01:57:28.159 --> 01:57:28.870 align:start position:0%
motherhood and apple pie you should do
it

01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're making a video to instruct people
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
on how to be brief would you be in it
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
this is wonderful
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
and uh the chair now recognizes don
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
landry and henry lippman
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're thinking of laminating the
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
card and just keeping it up here is that
 
01:57:51.360 --> 01:58:01.910 align:start position:0%
card and just keeping it up here is that
right

01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
for the record henry lippman medicaid
 
01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:06.550 align:start position:0%
for the record henry lippman medicaid
director

01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
committee i'm going to try to not repeat
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
any ground that's been covered here um
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
to try to get into that club of brief
 
01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:21.430 align:start position:0%
to try to get into that club of brief
testimony

01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
i think the underlying issue
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
with the income limits is they've not
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
been updated for about two decades
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
and so the 590 figure that talked about
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
i guess secondly with respect to our
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:44.790 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
i

01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
was reading over the bill that's
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
published online the 5.4 million dollar
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
number that's
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
represented there
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
is what our sort of midpoint estimate of
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of this
 
01:59:00.629 --> 01:59:00.639 align:start position:0%
i did note way down i think there was
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
some translation issue that we need to
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
correct with lba that
 
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
our range was 3.8 to
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
7.7 million and i think the 3.8 got cut
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
in half to be the 1.9 million um so i
 
01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
think we need to connect with lba to see
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
whether it was something that we
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
communicated incorrectly but if you look
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
at the core of the note we did talk
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
about it being 3.8 to 7.7 5.4 represents
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
a midpoint
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
currently um individuals under the
 
01:59:34.149 --> 01:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
public health emergency situation that
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
is declared federally
 
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.430 align:start position:0%
is declared federally
individuals

01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
during this period of march of 20 which
 
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
will probably run to at least through
 
01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:43.030 align:start position:0%
will probably run to at least through
april

01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
april
 
01:59:45.990 --> 01:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
of mid-april and possibly another
 
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
quarter potentially
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
based on what i'm seeing happening at a
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
that individuals who
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
during this period have
 
01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:57.270 align:start position:0%
during this period have
who

01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
meet the level of qualifying to be on
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid have continuous coverage at
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
this time so this bill
 
02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
moves to begin this in 23 which i think
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
is appropriate given
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty about the
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
enrollment in medicaid right now
 
02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
medicaid is
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
at the start of the public health
 
02:00:19.109 --> 02:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
emergency was about 178 000 it's now
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
almost 236 000 as of last week
 
02:00:24.149 --> 02:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
and so i think that you know it's
 
02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
responsible to
 
02:00:25.599 --> 02:00:26.950 align:start position:0%
responsible to
if

02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
there can be funding found for this
 
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
program to to implement it in 23 when
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be in a different place
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
with the with enrollment in medicaid
 
02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:37.510 align:start position:0%
with the with enrollment in medicaid
the

02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
reference to
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
the number of individuals of almost a
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
thousand individuals who would move into
 
02:00:44.709 --> 02:00:44.719 align:start position:0%
the status of
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
being able to get continuous coverage
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
you know at least on an annual basis
 
02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen that number go up
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
and down a bit but i think the 5.4
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
million is a is an estimate that we're
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
based on looking at pre-pandemic and
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the pandemic period
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of the other points have
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
been uncovered i think the policy is
 
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
something that the department supported
 
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
we had sought in the budget process to
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
get uh an appropriation to to implement
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
the program
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
um you know we we want to implement it
 
02:01:24.149 --> 02:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
you know we can't implement it without
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
are you prepared to take questions
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative folsom
 
02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman pearson and thank you
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i have a lot of
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
older people in my district
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
who own their homes
 
02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:44.870 align:start position:0%
who own their homes
and

02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that our homes are now
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing in
 
02:01:51.750 --> 02:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote value
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of homes for sale
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
they're now their taxes are just going
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
through the roof
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
they're all on on
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
incomes that could easily fit into here
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
but they happen to own their home
 
02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
is does that knock them out of this
 
02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:10.149 align:start position:0%
is does that knock them out of this
program

02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to let don who's our
 
02:02:13.990 --> 02:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility expert
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
no homes are generally an excluded
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
resource in the um
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
eligibility determination wonderful
 
02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leon
 
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
being here to answer questions i want to
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
clarify that the 5.4 million dollars is
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
for half a year so that midpoint
 
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
estimate would be 10.8 i just want to
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
make sure i might stack straight
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
so the 5.4 is the general fund amount
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
for a full 12 month period 10.8 would be
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
general land and
 
02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
federal participation
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:52.629 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
mckay

02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
mckay
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there's a single person
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
in this world that understands
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
everything about
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid but you get very close to that
 
02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.310 align:start position:0%
medicaid but you get very close to that
the

02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
situation about the fiscal note
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
very likely
 
02:03:11.599 --> 02:03:12.870 align:start position:0%
very likely
could

02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
have to do with the cost of living
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
increases that have occurred
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the interim
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
is that accurate
 
02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
i think what i was saying representative
 
02:03:24.070 --> 02:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
was that
 
02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
was that
the

02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
i think the reason that this bill is
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
important to the as you heard previously
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
is because the income limits have not
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
been indexed over the years and that the
 
02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
590 number was probably
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
established in the 1990s and the cost of
 
02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:40.790 align:start position:0%
established in the 1990s and the cost of
living

02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
living
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
means that it's tougher for people to to
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
live on that 590 and what this
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
bill would do is increase those limits
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
so that people would have a
 
02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
more reasonable but certainly not
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
um excessive amount of of income to live
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
on to afford you know rent and taxes and
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal note issue is i think
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
just an
 
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
interpretation of
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:12.159 --> 02:04:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
wow

02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
wow
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you folks thank you
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
bring to a close the hearing on house
 
02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
bill 1520
 
02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
and now open the hearing on house bill
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
1662 related to privacy obligations of
 
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.669 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
services

02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
this was a
 
02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:38.390 align:start position:0%
this was a
project

02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:39.270 align:start position:0%
project
of

02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:40.550 align:start position:0%
of
joint

02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
joint
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
legislative dhhs
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and most of the
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this bill
 
02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
and the prime sponsor
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
are members of oversight we worked hard
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
and long and
 
02:04:57.510 --> 02:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
the result is what you see before you so
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative edwards you took point on
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh i'm uh
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
representative jess edwards uh
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
representing auburn chester and sandown
 
02:05:20.719 --> 02:05:21.830 align:start position:0%
representing auburn chester and sandown
and

02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the opportunity to
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
introduce really the only bill i'm the
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this year
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
i've narrowed my focus because i think
 
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is that important i consider
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
this to be landmark legislation and and
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll try to explain why
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
i think in order to understand my
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
perspective on this privacy bill i that
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
you ought to know that for the last 10
 
02:05:53.669 --> 02:05:53.679 align:start position:0%
years of my civilian career i was a
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
privacy and security officer at um
 
02:06:00.069 --> 02:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
eastman kodak and then when that spun
 
02:06:02.229 --> 02:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
off to be care stream i became the
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
global privacy and i.t security officer
 
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
and then i had a nice offer from
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
phillips to move me into the area where
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
i was a global project officer for
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
privacy and i.t security so i i have
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
about 10 years of experience working for
 
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
medical device manufacturers
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
and seeing how the corporate structure
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
is managed to run
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
a good solid privacy program
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
and and what this bill does is it is
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:38.149 align:start position:0%
intended to
introduce

02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
privacy structures into the department
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
so that they can
 
02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
continue to evolve and routinize
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
their privacy standards policies
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
practices and the like
 
02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
as the chairman mentioned
 
02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
this work that led to this bill
 
02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:02.470 align:start position:0%
this work that led to this bill
got

02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
got
 
02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:03.510 align:start position:0%
got
started

02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
started
 
02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
as an hhs oversight project
 
02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
in hb2
 
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
there was concern in both houses
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
that the closed-loop referral system
 
02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
had gone
 
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
too rapidly and had been overlooking
 
02:07:23.189 --> 02:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
some privacy issues and so
 
02:07:23.199 --> 02:07:24.709 align:start position:0%
some privacy issues and so
hb2

02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
called a timeout on the expansion of
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
that system until we could the
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
legislature could conduct a privacy
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
audit of
 
02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
the department's practices and as a
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
were in general and specifically as they
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
related to the closed loop referral
 
02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:42.629 align:start position:0%
related to the closed loop referral
system

02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
i would like to make sure that everyone
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
understands that was an incredibly
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
cooperative and collaborative
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
exercise i worked primarily with the
 
02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:54.069 align:start position:0%
exercise i worked primarily with the
dhhs

02:07:54.069 --> 02:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
i.t director mr david wieters
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
and i was very pleasantly surprised not
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
surprised i was it was it was it was
 
02:08:03.599 --> 02:08:04.950 align:start position:0%
surprised i was it was it was it was
great

02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
understanding how much
 
02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
he as a it professional understood
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
the the need for privacy and for for
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
those of you that don't know the
 
02:08:15.599 --> 02:08:17.510 align:start position:0%
those of you that don't know the
distinction

02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
what we worry about oftentimes is i.t
 
02:08:22.149 --> 02:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
security we want to make sure nobody can
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
hack our
 
02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:24.470 align:start position:0%
hack our
systems

02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
and so in order for
 
02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
data to be secure in your privacy rights
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
you must have i.t security but if you
 
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't also have the policies in place to
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that individual privacy rights
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
are protected they can be overlooked so
 
02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
it is entirely possible to have i.t
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
security without privacy and so this is
 
02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
this bill is attempting to make sure
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
that we have a very much a
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
privacy-centric focus in what we do when
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're managing data
 
02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
as you know in 2018
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
a rare thing happened the new hampshire
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
approved an extension of our
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
constitution to give us a a right of
 
02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:12.069 align:start position:0%
constitution to give us a a right of
privacy

02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
basically it says that we shall be free
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
of governmental
 
02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
intrusion into our privacy um
 
02:09:20.159 --> 02:09:20.950 align:start position:0%
intrusion into our privacy um
and

02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh and so what what what this bill is
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
doing is trying to
 
02:09:29.069 --> 02:09:29.079 align:start position:0%
take the next step given that we have a
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to have our
 
02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
privacy protected
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
what should the department of health and
 
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
human services be doing
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
in order to have the infrastructure for
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
them to
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
keep growing and maturing
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
in the in the privacy models
 
02:09:50.069 --> 02:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
so um so i'd like to walk you through
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
the key components of this bill
 
02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:53.510 align:start position:0%
the key components of this bill
um

02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
now the scope of this uh is the
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
could it have been the entire state of
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire yes it could have but um i
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
believed that
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
based on my work with the hhs oversight
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
focusing on dhhs
 
02:10:15.990 --> 02:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
i had developed some expertise in the
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
state of
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
administrative methods being used there
 
02:10:25.189 --> 02:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
and did not feel comfortable
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
extending those
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
assumptions extrapolating what i knew
 
02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:31.599 align:start position:0%
over to doit
 
02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
should be noted that
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
doit could do much of this on their own
 
02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
without legislation so if they think
 
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea and i hope they do
 
02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:41.589 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea and i hope they do
then

02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
i don't think they need to wait for the
 
02:10:43.599 --> 02:10:45.669 align:start position:0%
i don't think they need to wait for the
legislature

02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:10:48.069 --> 02:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to read the declaration of
 
02:10:48.079 --> 02:10:49.189 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to read the declaration of
purpose

02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
that starts out the legislation i do
 
02:10:55.990 --> 02:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
want to focus on the last few sentences
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
starting at line seven where it says
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
the department has a responsibility to
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to the public the state's
 
02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
commitment to actively and overtly
 
02:11:11.350 --> 02:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
respect private personal privacy
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
including privacy of personal
 
02:11:16.149 --> 02:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
information and as a side note they need
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that commitment in order
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
to show that we respect
 
02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
the privacy right that got established
 
02:11:25.109 --> 02:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire constitution
 
02:11:28.069 --> 02:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
so establishing and maturing a culture
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
of privacy
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
is core to successfully driving future
 
02:11:34.229 --> 02:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
efforts to implement and enhance privacy
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
policies procedures and practice
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
continuous improvement requires
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate governance and policy
 
02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:42.629 align:start position:0%
appropriate governance and policy
leadership

02:11:42.629 --> 02:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
and so that's really what this bill is
 
02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
intended to do is to
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
set in place internal to the department
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
not subject to external review
 
02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:53.189 align:start position:0%
not subject to external review
but

02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh but definitely subject to the
 
02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
leadership of the commissioner um a
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
governance structure that's consistent
 
02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
with the way corporate america
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
treats uh this in their
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
grc standards
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
starting at line 15
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
talking about the
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
privacy and information technology
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
security governance board
 
02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
again i want to point out that this is
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
an internal board this is not a board
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's subject to
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight you know we may
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
have some questions that this board may
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
have some answers but but this is this
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
is a structure that they need in order
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
to do the job right
 
02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.870 align:start position:0%
to do the job right
um

02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
going down
 
02:12:46.079 --> 02:12:47.030 align:start position:0%
going down
um

02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:48.629 --> 02:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
into the membership
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
i you know personally i'm flexible on on
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
exactly who gets uh listed here
 
02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
um what what the goal was was to keep it
 
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
from getting too big
 
02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know i i think the perfect committee
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
size for this is about seven
 
02:13:06.629 --> 02:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
you know and and this is a little long
 
02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:09.599 align:start position:0%
for that but but uh if the committee
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
here were to want to adjust this at all
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh i would just ask you to make sure you
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
remember that this is a strategic
 
02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:18.790 align:start position:0%
remember that this is a strategic
internal

02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
internal
 
02:13:21.030 --> 02:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
governance committee that should be led
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner or a direct delegate
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
when she's unavailable so so even if
 
02:13:27.990 --> 02:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
she's unavailable i think she still
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be accountable for the delegate
 
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
if you want to know how this contrasts
 
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
with where they were when i did the
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
closed loop study
 
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
their govern they had sort of like a
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
governance committee but it was
 
02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
consisting of two i.t security
 
02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:44.470 align:start position:0%
consisting of two i.t security
professionals

02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
and and getting back to the earlier
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
discussion you can have
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
security without having privacy so this
 
02:13:52.709 --> 02:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
is meant to um
 
02:13:56.550 --> 02:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:58.709 --> 02:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
i want to emphasize maybe for the third
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
time that this is a dhhs controlled
 
02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:02.550 align:start position:0%
time that this is a dhhs controlled
process

02:14:02.550 --> 02:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
um from on page two from lines
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
three down to 18 there's a description
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the duties i don't have to read any
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
of those i think they make sense if the
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
committee has any questions about any of
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
there is no reporting to the legislature
 
02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
they are expected to post
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
their minutes
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
on a public-facing
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
site somewhere just so that people know
 
02:14:31.870 --> 02:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:34.069 align:start position:0%
what's going on
[Music]

02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:14:34.079 --> 02:14:35.430 align:start position:0%
[Music]
now

02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
the next lines 20 and 21
 
02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
i think are controversial and
 
02:14:45.109 --> 02:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
numerous times and i know this committee
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
has picked up numerous times the debate
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
on whether or not
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
i.t systems that collect our personal
 
02:14:53.679 --> 02:14:54.470 align:start position:0%
i.t systems that collect our personal
data

02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
should be opt in versus opt out
 
02:14:58.079 --> 02:14:59.109 align:start position:0%
should be opt in versus opt out
and

02:14:59.109 --> 02:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:59.119 --> 02:15:00.069 align:start position:0%
and
if

02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
and for the you know the short story of
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
that is opt-in is perceived by privacy
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
professionals as being more respectful
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
of an individual's right to privacy you
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
have to explicitly say you can use my
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
data and you can use it for the purpose
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
that you've told me about
 
02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
opt-out is basically the assumption that
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
any rational person would want their
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
data collected and used for a legitimate
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
purpose and so
 
02:15:27.189 --> 02:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
many of the systems
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
in dhhs have been set up as an opt-out
 
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
and that's offensive to me as a as a
 
02:15:36.550 --> 02:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
privacy professional but it's an ongoing
 
02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:37.510 align:start position:0%
privacy professional but it's an ongoing
debate

02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
debate
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i i don't want this bill
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
slowed down over that argument because
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
there's a separate bill coming from the
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
other house i think that's going to deal
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
with opt-in opt-out so if if we were to
 
02:15:51.430 --> 02:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
amendment amend this and mr chairman i'd
 
02:15:53.589 --> 02:15:53.599 align:start position:0%
be happy to go work on an amendment
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
before you accept this i guess on friday
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
um but but uh i would i would propose
 
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
the elimination of lines 20 and 21 to
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
get rid of the opt-in opt-out debate
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative edwards we would not be
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
executing this on friday because this
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
group does not meet oversight meets on
 
02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:12.390 align:start position:0%
group does not meet oversight meets on
friday

02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
friday
 
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
well good we can talk about her friday
 
02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.189 align:start position:0%
well good we can talk about her friday
okay

02:16:17.189 --> 02:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:17.199 --> 02:16:18.390 align:start position:0%
okay
um

02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:19.350 align:start position:0%
um
now

02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:20.149 align:start position:0%
now
uh

02:16:20.149 --> 02:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
that would neces if you deleted 20 and
 
02:16:26.069 --> 02:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
21 that would necessarily uh make it
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
moot that lines 20 and 30 are in there
 
02:16:30.629 --> 02:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
as well so they they could just be
 
02:16:30.639 --> 02:16:32.469 align:start position:0%
as well so they they could just be
dropped

02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
dropped
 
02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:34.559 align:start position:0%
then we get to line 31 where it's called
 
02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:37.030 align:start position:0%
risk management and
 
02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:38.790 align:start position:0%
risk management and
[Music]

02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
under risk management there's something
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
called a privacy impact assessment for
 
02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
privacy risk management and so um
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
so the the so the department is
 
02:16:53.429 --> 02:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
currently undertaking
 
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
a privacy impact assessment on
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
the closed loop system it's taken them
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
some time to get it done they've had
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
issues with the contractor and
 
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
contracting and the like but i i think i
 
02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:07.190 align:start position:0%
contracting and the like but i i think i
think

02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
think
where's

02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
where's
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
okay so so maybe maybe that became uh
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
mood along the way um because i i know
 
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
they quit funding the activity that
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
initiated all the concern but we just
 
02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
funded for 84 000
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
their conduct of a privacy impact
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
assessment for the vaccine registry
 
02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
there was a perception that many people
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the public are very nervous about how
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
the vaccine registry is going to be used
 
02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
so they're working on a pia
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
now what a privacy impact assessment
 
02:17:47.429 --> 02:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
does in general
 
02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:54.309 --> 02:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
the information that's needed by the
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
organization and then it does an
 
02:18:00.389 --> 02:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
analysis a data collection uh
 
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
effort to
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
to understand how data gets collected
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
how the permission to get the data gets
 
02:18:06.479 --> 02:18:07.429 align:start position:0%
how the permission to get the data gets
done

02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:18:09.750 --> 02:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh how the data gets into the system in
 
02:18:11.429 --> 02:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
a secure way how
 
02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's encrypted in transmission and in
 
02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:15.910 align:start position:0%
uh it's encrypted in transmission and in
rest

02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
rest
 
02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:16.790 align:start position:0%
rest
um

02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
how it gets processed and used and all
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
the way through the life cycle to where
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
it looks at how you how long you uh
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
retain the data and how you destroy it
 
02:18:29.669 --> 02:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
when you're no longer needing it you
 
02:18:31.349 --> 02:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
have to have a
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
plan to kill it at some date so privacy
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
impact assessment looks at all of that
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
and then assesses the risks to the
 
02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:40.230 align:start position:0%
and then assesses the risks to the
privacy

02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
02:18:42.549 --> 02:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
and then comes up with mitigation
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
strategies to reduce the risk
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then it should identify
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
the risks that can't be mitigated that
 
02:18:52.309 --> 02:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
we just accept you can't we we live in
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
an inherently risky world so you can't
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
mitigate all risks but you should
 
02:18:56.559 --> 02:18:58.070 align:start position:0%
mitigate all risks but you should
understand

02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
the ones that you have
 
02:19:00.319 --> 02:19:02.070 align:start position:0%
the ones that you have
retained

02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
retained
 
02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
so that's a the privacy impact
 
02:19:05.669 --> 02:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
assessment now
 
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
i'll jump
 
02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
over something and i'll come back to it
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
line 12 on page 3
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
is intended to
 
02:19:17.589 --> 02:19:17.599 align:start position:0%
authorize the hiring
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
of specialists
 
02:19:22.469 --> 02:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
in order to do a good privacy impact
 
02:19:22.479 --> 02:19:23.589 align:start position:0%
in order to do a good privacy impact
assessment

02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
you uh i think an individual needs to
 
02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:27.110 align:start position:0%
you uh i think an individual needs to
understand

02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
the technology very well to be fluent in
 
02:19:33.349 --> 02:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
i.t security issues and needs to be
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
affluent in privacy laws and certainly
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
fluent in all the
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
privacy policies and standards and so
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh in talking with um
 
02:19:46.150 --> 02:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
with leaders in dhhs i think the
 
02:19:47.830 --> 02:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
perception is that these people don't
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily exist today so they'd have
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
to go find some special skills and hire
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
them in
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
um the ols came up with labor grade 24.
 
02:20:01.110 --> 02:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
i i have no clue i don't know what a 24
 
02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:02.389 align:start position:0%
i i have no clue i don't know what a 24
is

02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
so if some smart person goes no that
 
02:20:05.710 --> 02:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
should be a
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
24.3 i i
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay i don't i don't really care about
 
02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:11.190 align:start position:0%
okay i don't i don't really care about
that

02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:12.150 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
now i'll come back to
 
02:20:17.429 --> 02:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
oh so if you don't like the privacy
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
impact assessments being done because
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
you don't think they're worthwhile and i
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
would disagree with you but if you don't
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
like that then we shouldn't be hiring
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
these two people because these two
 
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
people are really meant to handle the
 
02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
workload that is new
 
02:20:35.110 --> 02:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
that if we require these privacy impact
 
02:20:38.469 --> 02:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
assessments so no pia no people
 
02:20:38.479 --> 02:20:39.750 align:start position:0%
assessments so no pia no people
um

02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
then the part of this i'd also recommend
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
that we just delete in an amendment is
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
on page 3
 
02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 11.
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
no state or federal funds shall be spent
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
on any system that does not have a
 
02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
completed assessment and plan after
 
02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
january 1 2024
 
02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
02:21:03.910 --> 02:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
the intent there is good is to say hey
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
we're serious about these pias do do
 
02:21:06.479 --> 02:21:07.270 align:start position:0%
we're serious about these pias do do
them

02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
and if you don't do them you can't
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
implement the systems so that's that's
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
what 10 and 11 attempted to do but i i
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
think that's something that's open to
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
discussion with the the department just
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know that this isn't too brutal you
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
none of this is intended to harm the
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
department or hamstring the department
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
this is just meant to give them
 
02:21:35.429 --> 02:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
the tools people infrastructure
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
so that they can continue to develop and
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
continue to mature one of the things i
 
02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
noticed in the closed-loop referral
 
02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:43.030 align:start position:0%
noticed in the closed-loop referral
audit

02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
audit
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
was that
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
they had a tremendous number of the
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
privacy considerations
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
throughout sprinkled throughout their
 
02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
overall i.t project implementation but
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
there wasn't one coherent one cohesive
 
02:22:02.309 --> 02:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh view of how
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
we're trying to protect privacy with
 
02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
each it system so so this is intended
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's this concept of
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
an organizational privacy maturity model
 
02:22:15.190 --> 02:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh we're not the worst
 
02:22:17.190 --> 02:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're okay
 
02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
but if we want to become respectable if
 
02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
we want to do pay proper homage to
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
our constitutional right to privacy then
 
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
we would enable the department to mature
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
more so
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
so that's what this bill is intended to
 
02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:34.150 align:start position:0%
so that's what this bill is intended to
do

02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:22:43.439 --> 02:22:44.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
representative

02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
uh would you be willing uh what would
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
you think of having the meetings not
 
02:22:52.389 --> 02:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
only have the minutes posted but also
 
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
have them open to the public and subject
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
to 91a
 
02:22:56.319 --> 02:22:58.950 align:start position:0%
to 91a
uh

02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm
 
02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
let me think i have not anticipated that
 
02:23:05.429 --> 02:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
question and it's a fair question i um
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's an internal meeting i'm i'm not
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
intend i'm not intending it to be
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
legislative in nature and i'm just
 
02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:13.190 align:start position:0%
legislative in nature and i'm just
wondering

02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
02:23:15.429 --> 02:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
if they had a particular privacy
 
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
incident that they needed to review and
 
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
they needed to start sharing you know
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
names of people who may have had
 
02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:25.510 align:start position:0%
names of people who may have had
violations

02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
violations
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
both the employees and the and the
 
02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
people who had their information exposed
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
i that that should not be public so
 
02:23:37.990 --> 02:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
um so i like the minutes idea because
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
they can take the time to ensure that
 
02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
they sanitize it to the point where
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
they don't inadvertently release privacy
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
information uh to the public so follow
 
02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:49.990 align:start position:0%
information uh to the public so follow
up

02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:23:53.110 --> 02:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
um so what while in the 91a we can go
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
into uh you know non-public session
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
um maybe that would be appropriate for
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
those situations but for like regular
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
meetings where they're doing assessments
 
02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
of the system i i i wouldn't be opposed
 
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
to that i i just i just don't want to um
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
make this so scary to dhhs to stimulate
 
02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:12.870 align:start position:0%
make this so scary to dhhs to stimulate
opposition

02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
i i i do want to get this in place
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that that would be
 
02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:19.270 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that that would be
scary

02:24:19.270 --> 02:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
scary
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
question as as a follow-up to that which
 
02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
i hadn't really thought about
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
02:24:34.630 --> 02:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
as you have delineated the difference
 
02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
between security and privacy
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
if one of the concerns
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh with having the actual meeting be
 
02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
public is not only the release potential
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
the discussion potentially of somebody's
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
personal and private information in the
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
context of a particular issue but also
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
is there not a danger that
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
part of
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
what they're looking at is the security
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
aspect and the security aspect
 
02:25:06.070 --> 02:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
is not something you want
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
discussed i think that's a valid point
 
02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
in um
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm kind of i'm kind of rusty and
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i and i i think he got a really good
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
point there um
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
um and so i would i would want the
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
people currently working in the field to
 
02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
talk about the threat of saying too much
 
02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
about how the data is secured yeah
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:25:32.309 --> 02:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
i if i could though i don't think this
 
02:25:32.319 --> 02:25:34.230 align:start position:0%
i if i could though i don't think this
bill

02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:25:37.030 --> 02:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
gets it gets tripped up on that issue i
 
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
think this bill operates without
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
getting interfered with with the concern
 
02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
you just raised
 
02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:48.630 align:start position:0%
you just raised
follow-up

02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
would you believe i was only
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
expressing my concern as to the actual
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
broadcast of meetings right not
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
the internal operations of of the bill
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
right all right
 
02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:04.790 align:start position:0%
right all right
okay

02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
very good i just didn't want anyone to
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
think that this bill suffered from a
 
02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:09.910 align:start position:0%
think that this bill suffered from a
weakness

02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
weakness
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
related to revealing too much about
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
security strategy no i i don't have that
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
concern unless we are broadcasting
 
02:26:20.070 --> 02:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
meetings which at which those concerns
 
02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
being discussed uh yes ma'am these tend
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
to be pretty high level this governance
 
02:26:29.429 --> 02:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
board stuff tends to be policy related
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
they don't really get down into the
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
weeds but but they
 
02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:34.550 align:start position:0%
weeds but but they
could

02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative canarch
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
actually uh before my question i'll just
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
comment yeah when i was in the cunning
 
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
is this when i was in the county
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
delegation meeting we went into
 
02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
non-public when we talked about the
 
02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
security for the county jail for the
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
same reason
 
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
my question was
 
02:26:52.469 --> 02:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
this bill as you point out establishes
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
two labor gate grade 24 employees but
 
02:26:57.429 --> 02:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note identifies the need for
 
02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars more to
 
02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
implement this
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh they talk about um
 
02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
because of the privacy impact of being
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
about 470 000 the chief privacy offer
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
officer around 200k and
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh resources for identifying systems
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
235. so the question is
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh do we i don't see an appropriation or
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
how do we pay for that yeah i think
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent
 
02:27:29.030 --> 02:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
question and hopefully the the people in
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
division three when they get this as a
 
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
second bill we'll take a look at the
 
02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal piece i i i can only tell you
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
that my focus has been on um
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
coordinating support for
 
02:27:42.479 --> 02:27:43.270 align:start position:0%
coordinating support for
the

02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
how to do things not how much they'll
 
02:27:45.439 --> 02:27:46.870 align:start position:0%
how to do things not how much they'll
cost

02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
that's the point at which we could find
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
out what grade 24 means yeah exactly
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you for
 
02:28:00.550 --> 02:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question is there a required
 
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
um reporting to dhhs i mean from dhhs to
 
02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:06.710 align:start position:0%
um reporting to dhhs i mean from dhhs to
the

02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:08.070 align:start position:0%
the
um

02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
hhs advisory
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
board so so i i don't want to step on
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
the chairman's toes but hhs oversight
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
has tremendous latitude and what it uh
 
02:28:21.429 --> 02:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
asks of the commissioner to come report
 
02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
on i i have not viewed this as a routine
 
02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
reporting issue and and the reason i
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
avoided saying that there's a routine
 
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
reporting issue here
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
i want the department
 
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
to own this
 
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
to feel like it's theirs and not the
 
02:28:44.230 --> 02:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
legislator legislature imposing
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
something on them and
 
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
and it's it's my
 
02:28:50.309 --> 02:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
organizational systems belief that if
 
02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
they they have ownership of this
 
02:28:55.030 --> 02:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
then they'll actually
 
02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
do more and do better with it than if
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know they thought they were being
 
02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
whipped into compliance
 
02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
02:29:05.429 --> 02:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:29:09.270 --> 02:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
um would this
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
implementation of this
 
02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
oversight in terms of the data the data
 
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
is processed internally would that
 
02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
impact the actual functioning which i
 
02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
think is under my understanding is that
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
hhs is trying to develop a broad
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
database such that the functioning is if
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
i need a service a
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
and i put my data in
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
and then later on
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
i keep that same service grant but i
 
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
need another service
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
i don't have to
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
re-enter through another portal and they
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
can use my data from that first portal
 
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
and make it more efficient yes sir will
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
this impact that in any way okay so so
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
by deleting the whole opt-in opt-out
 
02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
section i'm trying to avoid
 
02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:54.550 align:start position:0%
section i'm trying to avoid
that

02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
so that we can get this bill put into
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
place get to start the first step
 
02:29:58.560 --> 02:29:59.590 align:start position:0%
place get to start the first step
started

02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
started
 
02:30:02.309 --> 02:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
to answer your question in a way in
 
02:30:05.670 --> 02:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
which i know the answer i i can tell you
 
02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:07.429 align:start position:0%
which i know the answer i i can tell you
about

02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
corporate america when
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
we collect data
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
we are required to do an opt-in we have
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
to get an affirmative acceptance by the
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
person that they will relinquish control
 
02:30:22.710 --> 02:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
of their data to us
 
02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:23.590 align:start position:0%
of their data to us
and

02:30:23.590 --> 02:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:25.830 --> 02:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
as we do that you can imagine a sheet of
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
paper or could be a web
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
screen of some kind that tells them
 
02:30:32.710 --> 02:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
things like
 
02:30:35.190 --> 02:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
if you give us your data this is how we
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
will use it
 
02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
we will not use this information for
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
anything other than what we say
 
02:30:45.510 --> 02:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
now to you on how we'll use it and in
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
fact our commitment to you is if we
 
02:30:50.309 --> 02:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
identify another purpose for this
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
information we will have to come back
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
and positively get
 
02:30:58.389 --> 02:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
your permission again for the new use
 
02:30:58.399 --> 02:30:59.110 align:start position:0%
your permission again for the new use
so

02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
so it's very
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
controlled in
 
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
corporate marketing and the marketing
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
people that would come to me got really
 
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
upset because they just wanted to let's
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
you know we can build better products we
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
can provide better services i i don't
 
02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
know how i'm going to need this data in
 
02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
the future just let me have it
 
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
no no it's it
 
02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
it all starts with the principle that
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
the the data is like a car
 
02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know representative cannon controls
 
02:31:28.389 --> 02:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
her car
 
02:31:30.389 --> 02:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
if i'm going to come borrow her car i
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
need to tell her
 
02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
exactly how i'm going to use it and
 
02:31:36.389 --> 02:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
where i'm going to go and when i'm going
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
to return it
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
and it's sort of that kind of a respect
 
02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
and if all of a sudden i decide i want
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
to go to pittsburgh because my grandma
 
02:31:45.670 --> 02:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
is sick i can't just take off to
 
02:31:48.309 --> 02:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
pittsburgh so so that analogy is meant
 
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
to address your question can the data
 
02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
once collected be repurposed
 
02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh in a way that is outside of the
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
consent agreement
 
02:31:58.240 --> 02:31:59.270 align:start position:0%
consent agreement
no

02:31:59.270 --> 02:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative cofoult
 
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:04.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
representative

02:32:04.630 --> 02:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
um i didn't see a definition here of
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
personal information and i know under
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
hipaa there are there's a pretty clear
 
02:32:15.429 --> 02:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
definition of pii personally
 
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
identifiable information
 
02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
is it the intention that this would
 
02:32:20.430 --> 02:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:21.590 align:start position:0%
apply to
[Music]

02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information as
 
02:32:27.750 --> 02:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
hipaa does for example or that that it
 
02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
would apply to any personal information
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
including that that has no
 
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
personal personally identifiable
 
02:32:37.670 --> 02:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
data points attached to it
 
02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:38.389 align:start position:0%
data points attached to it
so

02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
the first draft of this had about eight
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
different definitions in it and i went
 
02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
to different sources to get those
 
02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:46.389 align:start position:0%
to different sources to get those
definitions

02:32:46.389 --> 02:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
02:32:46.399 --> 02:32:47.270 align:start position:0%
definitions
and

02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:49.349 --> 02:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
everything was going swimmingly i was
 
02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
pulling down expert definitions from
 
02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
international standards boards and then
 
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
the u.s
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
international standards organization and
 
02:32:59.429 --> 02:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
and then everything was great until i
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
started noticing that some of the
 
02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
definitions for the same term were
 
02:33:04.640 --> 02:33:05.670 align:start position:0%
definitions for the same term were
different

02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
and so what i decided to do was to punt
 
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
and and allow
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
this governance board who's charged with
 
02:33:16.630 --> 02:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
having the authority to establish
 
02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:17.910 align:start position:0%
having the authority to establish
policies

02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
policies
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
to establish the definitions that
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
they'll use if you talk to privacy
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
people about what personally
 
02:33:26.950 --> 02:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
identifiable information is they
 
02:33:28.630 --> 02:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
generally will say the same thing
 
02:33:30.309 --> 02:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're quoting the exact
 
02:33:31.750 --> 02:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
same definition
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:39.990 --> 02:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:33:44.710 --> 02:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you
 
02:33:47.910 --> 02:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative edwards taking the
 
02:33:49.590 --> 02:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
what's to prevent
 
02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
the department now
 
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
to create a governance board without
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
going through legislation if it's an
 
02:33:56.800 --> 02:33:58.630 align:start position:0%
going through legislation if it's an
internal

02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
internal
 
02:34:00.389 --> 02:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
what's to prevent preventive department
 
02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:02.710 align:start position:0%
what's to prevent preventive department
today

02:34:02.710 --> 02:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:34:04.710 --> 02:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
from creating such a board
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh i i think they could certainly do
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
that just the same as i mentioned doit
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
could um i think if they want to
 
02:34:14.070 --> 02:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
have somebody support the governance
 
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
structure and able to also do pias they
 
02:34:19.110 --> 02:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
want the money associated with the two
 
02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:20.230 align:start position:0%
want the money associated with the two
personnel

02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
slots because this is new work in a new
 
02:34:25.670 --> 02:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
subject matter for which you know the
 
02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
people who do understand it already have
 
02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
full-time jobs so so i think i think
 
02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:32.790 align:start position:0%
full-time jobs so so i think i think
it's

02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
while they could certainly do it
 
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
their ability to execute on it without
 
02:34:39.429 --> 02:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
the manpower may be an issue
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um so basically we're looking
 
02:34:48.550 --> 02:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
for appropriations more than a policy
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
i i'm so sorry i i couldn't quite make
 
02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
out your son so basically if
 
02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:54.710 align:start position:0%
out your son so basically if
understanding

02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
right now what we're looking for is the
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
money not so much that
 
02:34:59.590 --> 02:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know the department can possibly do
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
this now but they do need the funds
 
02:35:02.790 --> 02:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
which i totally understand but
 
02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
are we co-mingling a policy creation of
 
02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
an internal department with
 
02:35:07.359 --> 02:35:08.710 align:start position:0%
an internal department with
appropriations

02:35:08.710 --> 02:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
02:35:10.950 --> 02:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i i
 
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
i think if they weren't so darn busy
 
02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
they would just want to do this and the
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
purp the value of the legislation
 
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
is there's a little carrot and a little
 
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
stick you know there is definitely a
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
thou shalt aspect to it but there's the
 
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
carrot too saying hey you know we
 
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
understand it's new work with new
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts and we'll support
 
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
that so
 
02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's a win-win
 
02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
since i can't ask a question i'll make
 
02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:39.750 align:start position:0%
it as a statement
 
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:41.510 align:start position:0%
it as a statement
[Music]

02:35:41.510 --> 02:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
this means the people are involved in
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
the process not just those quote
 
02:35:49.110 --> 02:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
nameless bureaucrats somewhere unquote
 
02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
the people as represented by us
 
02:35:54.389 --> 02:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
have a big stake in the privacy
 
02:35:56.630 --> 02:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
so yeah the department could do it but
 
02:35:59.429 --> 02:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
we're in on it too
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a question
 
02:36:01.439 --> 02:36:04.150 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a question
yes

02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:06.710 --> 02:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative mckay next
 
02:36:09.429 --> 02:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned a labor grade but
 
02:36:14.230 --> 02:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
didn't know the salary
 
02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure that at the back of the
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
red book
 
02:36:19.270 --> 02:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
it lists
 
02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
all of the categories all of the
 
02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:22.710 align:start position:0%
all of the categories all of the
salaries

02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
salaries
 
02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
and it even lists them by
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner deputy commissioner
 
02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm pretty sure that's the red book
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
if not it's the black book
 
02:36:34.389 --> 02:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
and we all know what the red book is in
 
02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
we may know what they are but i i have
 
02:36:43.270 --> 02:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
never broken one open but uh but i i
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
suspect we'll break something open in
 
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
division three
 
02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:54.790 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:57.190 --> 02:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm looking for i think
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
02:37:02.309 --> 02:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
amendments you suggested go a long way
 
02:37:04.630 --> 02:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
to leaving some of the concerns i had
 
02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
initially and i i appreciate
 
02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:09.030 align:start position:0%
initially and i i appreciate
the

02:37:09.030 --> 02:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
narrower focus of what remains
 
02:37:14.110 --> 02:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
what i'd like is a little bit of
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
clarification on the one hand
 
02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
we have the very important privacy
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
consideration that that we know about
 
02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
on the other hand we are not dealing
 
02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
with corporate america we are dealing
 
02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:28.950 align:start position:0%
with corporate america we are dealing
with

02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
often dealing with a vulnerable
 
02:37:34.469 --> 02:37:34.479 align:start position:0%
population not always but but sometimes
 
02:37:36.550 --> 02:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with a vulnerable population in
 
02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
need of services
 
02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:40.309 align:start position:0%
need of services
and

02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:40.319 --> 02:37:41.150 align:start position:0%
and
the

02:37:41.150 --> 02:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
concern for
 
02:37:47.110 --> 02:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
a population which may not have as good
 
02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
computer services
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
telephones cars everything else
 
02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
how are we balancing the very valid
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
privacy interest
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
with the concern about making sure
 
02:38:09.030 --> 02:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
that we are not putting roadblocks
 
02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
in the way of services
 
02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
for people who very much need the
 
02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
services but may not be really good at
 
02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
the forms the permission slips and other
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
things and i i'm wondering if
 
02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's contemplated that
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
there may be
 
02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:30.550 align:start position:0%
there may be
differing

02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
dimensions of permission about what
 
02:38:34.710 --> 02:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
people might give
 
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
their permission for or whether somebody
 
02:38:38.469 --> 02:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
is going to run up against the roadblock
 
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
of every single time they need another
 
02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
service they're going to have to start a
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
process all over again which was the
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
so i think that's a valid question
 
02:38:53.830 --> 02:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
talking about different points of view i
 
02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
i happen to believe that even old senile
 
02:38:59.670 --> 02:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
and feeble people should have their
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
privacy rights proactively protected but
 
02:39:04.469 --> 02:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
the conversation that we would have
 
02:39:08.230 --> 02:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
around that would probably be part of an
 
02:39:11.670 --> 02:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
opt-in versus opt-out conversation
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
and so i'm trying to not bring that
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
conversation into this bill
 
02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
by recommending that we delete the
 
02:39:23.110 --> 02:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
opt-in opt-out section of this bill
 
02:39:25.910 --> 02:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
so there'll be another bill don't forget
 
02:39:27.750 --> 02:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
your question because we'll be in
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
another bill from the other house
 
02:39:31.830 --> 02:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with opt-in and opt-out and i
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
think that's a good time to have that
 
02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
question now in this bill the way this
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
would get dealt with your question would
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
be dealt with would be that internal
 
02:39:42.630 --> 02:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
government's governance structure would
 
02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
be taking a look at the information
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
requirements that they're trying to
 
02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
satisfy and and making the determination
 
02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
of whether it should be opt-in or
 
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
well it's more a matter of personal
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
privilege i just want to make sure
 
02:40:03.030 --> 02:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
i i want to make very sure that it's
 
02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
understood that i am not being
 
02:40:07.270 --> 02:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
dismissive of the privacy rights of
 
02:40:10.150 --> 02:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
anybody in this state no
 
02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
but i do want
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
to ensure that as we are setting up
 
02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
protections we are also not putting
 
02:40:21.269 --> 02:40:21.279 align:start position:0%
roadblocks in their way and i i thank
 
02:40:23.190 --> 02:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
you for the answer that is
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh that that's still yet to be
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
determined and and it's part of an
 
02:40:29.349 --> 02:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
ongoing process i just want to be sure
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
it's not lost in the shuffle thank you
 
02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
right and to stick up for corporations
 
02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
they also deal with the same population
 
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
and they still
 
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
worry about
 
02:40:42.469 --> 02:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
proactively protecting privacy so it's
 
02:40:44.070 --> 02:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know at phillips when we were making
 
02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
medical devices we
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
we were using those medical devices on
 
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
the vulnerable population that i think
 
02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and the last
 
02:41:06.309 --> 02:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
yep thank you i i appreciate i'm going
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
to be available for questions anytime
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
after the hearing um and i'll see you
 
02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
friday mr chair thank you and i'm going
 
02:41:16.630 --> 02:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
to be putting an amendment crew together
 
02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh the little this is in that's and
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
they'll be working with you and perhaps
 
02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
some others
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
to uh polish up anything we need to
 
02:41:30.309 --> 02:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh my my hope would be that that would
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
be a continuation of the collaborative
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
process that we started with dha hs
 
02:41:39.110 --> 02:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
around the closed loop system
 
02:41:41.910 --> 02:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
that would be my hope as well because
 
02:41:44.230 --> 02:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
that was our not only our intent but i
 
02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
think our
 
02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's how we did it
 
02:41:48.389 --> 02:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
that's all you led it thank you thank
 
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
you uh reppers uh thank you
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative calling chair calls um
 
02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
paula minihan from the new hampshire
 
02:41:55.760 --> 02:41:56.830 align:start position:0%
paula minihan from the new hampshire
hospital

02:41:56.830 --> 02:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:41:59.830 --> 02:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
association she has
 
02:42:02.790 --> 02:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
copies of a handout written testimony
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
and the card says she is in opposition
 
02:42:23.910 --> 02:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
02:42:28.150 --> 02:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
committee paula minihan
 
02:42:30.070 --> 02:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
representing the hospital association we
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
have concerns about this bill but the
 
02:42:34.469 --> 02:42:34.479 align:start position:0%
section that we were concerned about is
 
02:42:37.269 --> 02:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
the section um regarding notice consent
 
02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
and data subjects because of the fact as
 
02:42:43.269 --> 02:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
representative edwards indicated it
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
changes all of the data sets to an
 
02:42:48.469 --> 02:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
opt-in consent requirement
 
02:42:50.469 --> 02:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
if that were to be removed if that's
 
02:42:52.710 --> 02:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
what the
 
02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
committee agreed to do um then we would
 
02:42:56.950 --> 02:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
be um
 
02:42:58.630 --> 02:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
okay we don't have any comments with the
 
02:43:01.269 --> 02:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill so that is the specific
 
02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
section that we were concerned about and
 
02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
my test as my testimony indicates
 
02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:07.030 align:start position:0%
my test as my testimony indicates
um

02:43:07.030 --> 02:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:10.309 --> 02:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
changing this to an opt-in would be um
 
02:43:13.030 --> 02:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily um burdensome and
 
02:43:14.870 --> 02:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
problematic from our perspective it
 
02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
would be a monumental undertaking
 
02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
undertaking um so i sounds like we'll
 
02:43:21.910 --> 02:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
have a different we'll have a separate
 
02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
conversation about that in the future
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
but if that were to be removed then um
 
02:43:28.950 --> 02:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have any concerns
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
outstanding concerns with this bill
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:37.590 --> 02:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes uh
 
02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:39.190 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes uh
questions

02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
yes liam thank you very much for taking
 
02:43:45.269 --> 02:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
my question what sort of data
 
02:43:48.469 --> 02:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
would be extremely burdensome to get
 
02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
permission oh
 
02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
and an opt-in instead of another it's a
 
02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's the function of changing um the
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
requirement of everything that goes to
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
the department would need to be an
 
02:44:02.309 --> 02:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
opt-in versus an opt-out so that is just
 
02:44:02.319 --> 02:44:03.269 align:start position:0%
opt-in versus an opt-out so that is just
that's

02:44:03.269 --> 02:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:44:06.950 --> 02:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
a big big big change follow-up follow-up
 
02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
what kind of data
 
02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:10.870 align:start position:0%
what kind of data
um

02:44:10.870 --> 02:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:13.349 --> 02:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
i don't i can't articulate all of those
 
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
right now because i would need to
 
02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
um so any data that the department um
 
02:44:23.030 --> 02:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
requests for instance all the medicaid
 
02:44:25.269 --> 02:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
data for instance um if the hospitals
 
02:44:28.389 --> 02:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
have to submit data to the hospitals
 
02:44:30.630 --> 02:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
to the department relative to
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
medicaid they hospitals work with the
 
02:44:36.150 --> 02:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
department on many many projects so i i
 
02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
really again i can't articulate any
 
02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
specifics right now um but if that were
 
02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
to be removed um and again i think this
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
will be a separate debate in a future
 
02:44:48.870 --> 02:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
hearing so i'll just
 
02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
leave it at that thank you so much
 
02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes and i'm on a roll
 
02:44:58.790 --> 02:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
on pronouncing french names danny goulet
 
02:45:01.349 --> 02:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
or dennis
 
02:45:04.710 --> 02:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
roulette dennis if the chair if the
 
02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
chair would agree i was asked to
 
02:45:10.230 --> 02:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
hear david
 
02:45:14.389 --> 02:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
yes please david weeder's first
 
02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
and that's a german name and i know i
 
02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
got it right
 
02:45:21.910 --> 02:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair and members
 
02:45:25.349 --> 02:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is david
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
weeders i'm the information services
 
02:45:29.830 --> 02:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
director for dhhs
 
02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:31.670 align:start position:0%
director for dhhs
and

02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
i just want to start with we definitely
 
02:45:38.550 --> 02:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
at dhhs have a privacy by design privacy
 
02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:39.590 align:start position:0%
at dhhs have a privacy by design privacy
culture

02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
culture
 
02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:41.030 align:start position:0%
culture
and

02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
have a stress on the importance of
 
02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
privacy for the individual's data that
 
02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
we collect store
 
02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:48.070 align:start position:0%
we collect store
retain

02:45:48.070 --> 02:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
retain
 
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
share and leverage for the services that
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
we render in the state of new hampshire
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
we registered initially in the
 
02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill but as
 
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative edwards testified
 
02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
earlier the removal of the section on
 
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
page 219 lines 19 through 30
 
02:46:09.269 --> 02:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
would essentially alleviate most of our
 
02:46:11.429 --> 02:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
issues with this bill so we do agree
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
with having a privacy governance board
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
within the department
 
02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
the membership
 
02:46:19.110 --> 02:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
we would be looking to
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that we would be able to have
 
02:46:23.110 --> 02:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
either those members or their delegates
 
02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
right now it doesn't state an option for
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
delegates so we would be looking to have
 
02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:28.070 align:start position:0%
delegates so we would be looking to have
that

02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
statement in there so that if they were
 
02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
unavailable we could still convene the
 
02:46:35.110 --> 02:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
meetings and move forward
 
02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
the component that we addressed in the
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note worksheets was
 
02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:41.429 align:start position:0%
fiscal note worksheets was
combining

02:46:41.429 --> 02:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
combining
 
02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
the recommendation for two additional
 
02:46:45.349 --> 02:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
staff along with our existing subject
 
02:46:48.150 --> 02:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
matter experts and this actual time it
 
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
will take to perform the privacy impact
 
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
assessments that you find on
 
02:46:55.349 --> 02:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
the section requiring privacy impact
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
assessments on all our systems
 
02:46:58.950 --> 02:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
and there was also another section in
 
02:47:01.110 --> 02:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note worksheet addressing how
 
02:47:04.550 --> 02:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
much time and effort it would take to do
 
02:47:06.469 --> 02:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
the actual review of the system's
 
02:47:08.230 --> 02:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
impacts of opt in
 
02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
so we would be
 
02:47:12.150 --> 02:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note worksheet a component
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
of that would be removed
 
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
if you remove line glide items 19
 
02:47:18.830 --> 02:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
through 30 for the opt-in
 
02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:20.710 align:start position:0%
through 30 for the opt-in
considerations

02:47:20.710 --> 02:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
02:47:22.550 --> 02:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
the the only other component that i want
 
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this committee is
 
02:47:25.990 --> 02:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
aware of is when we looked at the labor
 
02:47:28.230 --> 02:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
grade 24 for those two positions and
 
02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
based off of our current ability to
 
02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
recruit staff we believe that labor
 
02:47:37.830 --> 02:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
grade 24 which is an estimated um
 
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
salary of 49 354 and 50 cents based off
 
02:47:45.510 --> 02:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
of our current hiring strategy
 
02:47:47.349 --> 02:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the current estimate
 
02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
would be too low for us to be able to
 
02:47:52.870 --> 02:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
recruit the individuals necessary to do
 
02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
a concerted effort in in terms of the
 
02:47:58.230 --> 02:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
importance of privacy and the impacts
 
02:48:00.150 --> 02:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
and needs of the security associated
 
02:48:01.110 --> 02:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:48:02.710 --> 02:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
our recommendation in the fiscal note
 
02:48:05.590 --> 02:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
worksheet was to hire two business
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
systems analysts two positions which are
 
02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
labor grade 32
 
02:48:12.550 --> 02:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
and a starting salary on grade one of
 
02:48:16.389 --> 02:48:16.399 align:start position:0%
step one of 69 000 907 and 50 cents
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
with the addition of a chief privacy
 
02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:20.150 align:start position:0%
with the addition of a chief privacy
officer

02:48:20.150 --> 02:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
officer
 
02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
which would be working
 
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
with and at the direction of doit's
 
02:48:26.710 --> 02:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner on commissioner dennis
 
02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:27.750 align:start position:0%
commissioner on commissioner dennis
goulet

02:48:27.750 --> 02:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
goulet
 
02:48:30.630 --> 02:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
to help us not only take this privacy
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
governance board for dhhs but take it to
 
02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
the next level for the whole state
 
02:48:37.830 --> 02:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
and so that would be a combination where
 
02:48:40.150 --> 02:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
we would be looking to try to
 
02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
leverage this privacy governance board
 
02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
to set the standards for which
 
02:48:48.389 --> 02:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
the state can look at privacy and that
 
02:48:50.469 --> 02:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
we would have the positions necessary to
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
start that process
 
02:48:55.269 --> 02:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions any
 
02:48:55.279 --> 02:48:58.309 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions any
questions

02:48:58.309 --> 02:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you miss
 
02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
whitaker taking my question
 
02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
so where would the chief pharmacy or
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
chief privacy officer reside in
 
02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:49:13.750 --> 02:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the department i t
 
02:49:16.710 --> 02:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
shared how it and number two
 
02:49:18.309 --> 02:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
it's not really addressed in this bill
 
02:49:20.469 --> 02:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
as far as any funding for it
 
02:49:22.389 --> 02:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
so two questions i guess is one is where
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
should it reside structurally and then
 
02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
how do we fund it
 
02:49:29.030 --> 02:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
so i'll
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
make my recommendations but i'm sure
 
02:49:32.389 --> 02:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet will might have some
 
02:49:35.590 --> 02:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
also suggestions behind me um but
 
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
i believe our conversation was that we
 
02:49:39.349 --> 02:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
would recommend it structurally to be
 
02:49:42.389 --> 02:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
residing under or directly to
 
02:49:44.630 --> 02:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of doit
 
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
so there would be a statewide impact
 
02:49:49.269 --> 02:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
privacy impact as opposed to a dhhs
 
02:49:49.279 --> 02:49:50.550 align:start position:0%
privacy impact as opposed to a dhhs
focus

02:49:50.550 --> 02:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
focus
 
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
and if the funding for it we have not
 
02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
identified but we would be looking to if
 
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
this bill would be looking to
 
02:49:59.510 --> 02:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
address that funding that would be an
 
02:50:01.429 --> 02:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
area or we could look for future
 
02:50:05.750 --> 02:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:08.469 --> 02:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:10.790 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

02:50:10.790 --> 02:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
um i know that the representative didn't
 
02:50:15.349 --> 02:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
want to make this bill too scary but
 
02:50:17.670 --> 02:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed
 
02:50:19.830 --> 02:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have concerns about a
 
02:50:22.469 --> 02:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
fox guarding a hen house and i think
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
public participation would increase
 
02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
confidence in this program would you be
 
02:50:28.950 --> 02:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to having
 
02:50:31.030 --> 02:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
the meetings being subject to 91a and
 
02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
having some public involvement in this
 
02:50:37.590 --> 02:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question and
 
02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question and our goal
 
02:50:41.590 --> 02:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
is to be as transparent as possible
 
02:50:44.389 --> 02:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
however in order to achieve good privacy
 
02:50:46.469 --> 02:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
and security for systems we would need
 
02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
to have open honest conversations that
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
could not necessarily be public because
 
02:50:53.030 --> 02:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
it would put the individual's data
 
02:50:54.710 --> 02:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
within the state of new hampshire in
 
02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:56.150 align:start position:0%
within the state of new hampshire in
jeopardy

02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
jeopardy
 
02:50:58.150 --> 02:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
being making that public showing
 
02:50:59.750 --> 02:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities that we're trying to
 
02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:00.950 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities that we're trying to
address

02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
and so it would
 
02:51:04.389 --> 02:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
it could potentially
 
02:51:06.550 --> 02:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
impact the ability for that privacy
 
02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
governance board to actually
 
02:51:11.910 --> 02:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
pass meaningful policies and procedures
 
02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
because it would not be able to review
 
02:51:15.830 --> 02:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
that vote those security and privacy
 
02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
concerns at the detail it would need to
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
if it was a publicly held hearing so
 
02:51:21.269 --> 02:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
those are just some concerns that we
 
02:51:23.910 --> 02:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
would have but as representative edwards
 
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
indicated if we stayed at a very high
 
02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:26.710 align:start position:0%
indicated if we stayed at a very high
level

02:51:26.710 --> 02:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:51:27.830 --> 02:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
and didn't
 
02:51:29.590 --> 02:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
drive into the weeds and we had a
 
02:51:31.590 --> 02:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
separate meeting to do that
 
02:51:32.950 --> 02:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's something that could be
 
02:51:35.190 --> 02:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
considered follow-up
 
02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:35.990 align:start position:0%
considered follow-up
um

02:51:35.990 --> 02:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:38.790 --> 02:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
you may not be very familiar with um the
 
02:51:41.910 --> 02:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
91a public meeting portion of the law
 
02:51:44.790 --> 02:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
but it does allow for
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
non-public sessions within a public
 
02:51:49.349 --> 02:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
meeting so that those um
 
02:51:51.349 --> 02:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
those issues could be discussed outside
 
02:51:52.870 --> 02:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
of a public meeting and only what is
 
02:51:54.710 --> 02:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
necessary to disclose
 
02:51:56.309 --> 02:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
later after the issues are dealt with
 
02:51:58.309 --> 02:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
they can be made public are you would
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
you believe that
 
02:52:03.349 --> 02:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i am aware of
 
02:52:03.359 --> 02:52:04.150 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i am aware of
the

02:52:04.150 --> 02:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:52:06.389 --> 02:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a public and
 
02:52:09.349 --> 02:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
non-public sessions we would be we would
 
02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
have to structure the meeting such that
 
02:52:13.429 --> 02:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
we could go to a non-public session in
 
02:52:15.030 --> 02:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
order to not
 
02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:18.389 align:start position:0%
order to not
unnecessarily

02:52:18.389 --> 02:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:20.469 --> 02:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
change the momentum of the conversation
 
02:52:22.950 --> 02:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
so it may cause some erratic
 
02:52:24.630 --> 02:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
behavior of what's public and what's
 
02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:25.830 align:start position:0%
behavior of what's public and what's
non-public

02:52:25.830 --> 02:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
non-public
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
initially and but we would have to form
 
02:52:29.429 --> 02:52:29.439 align:start position:0%
and say here's what our agenda is for
 
02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
public and then here's a non-public
 
02:52:35.030 --> 02:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:37.750 --> 02:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you
 
02:52:39.429 --> 02:52:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:52:41.269 --> 02:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
this is a piggyback to
 
02:52:44.950 --> 02:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
02:52:46.870 --> 02:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
that representative cushman just asked
 
02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:47.910 align:start position:0%
that representative cushman just asked
you

02:52:47.910 --> 02:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:52:47.920 --> 02:52:48.630 align:start position:0%
you
i

02:52:48.630 --> 02:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:52:50.870 --> 02:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
since y'all are
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
sinchalla are dealing with policy
 
02:52:58.710 --> 02:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
rather than specific individuals
 
02:53:01.190 --> 02:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
i assume that if you
 
02:53:03.750 --> 02:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
i this is a question but i'm saying it
 
02:53:05.429 --> 02:53:05.439 align:start position:0%
like a southerner with the question mark
 
02:53:06.630 --> 02:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
02:53:07.990 --> 02:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh would
 
02:53:10.150 --> 02:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
02:53:12.070 --> 02:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
whenever you'd have to go into the weeds
 
02:53:13.590 --> 02:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
as you said
 
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
which i assume means talking about
 
02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
particular people and conditions
 
02:53:21.830 --> 02:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
that sounds like it would be a part of
 
02:53:25.590 --> 02:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
the non-public discussion but as policy
 
02:53:27.910 --> 02:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
setters it seems like
 
02:53:31.190 --> 02:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's not a violation at all of
 
02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:32.550 align:start position:0%
that's not a violation at all of
individuals

02:53:32.550 --> 02:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:53:35.590 --> 02:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
policy is going to apply to everybody
 
02:53:36.790 --> 02:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:53:39.110 --> 02:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
it seems
 
02:53:41.190 --> 02:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it wouldn't it make sense that
 
02:53:43.830 --> 02:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
it can be publicly discussed
 
02:53:47.830 --> 02:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
and certainly not ever mention a person
 
02:53:47.840 --> 02:53:48.630 align:start position:0%
and certainly not ever mention a person
but

02:53:48.630 --> 02:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
but the policy is what we're all
 
02:53:53.510 --> 02:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about and really happy that
 
02:53:57.110 --> 02:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
this is y'all are working on it
 
02:53:57.120 --> 02:53:58.309 align:start position:0%
this is y'all are working on it
but

02:53:58.309 --> 02:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:54:00.469 --> 02:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time thinking that
 
02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
most of this would be
 
02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:02.870 align:start position:0%
most of this would be
too

02:54:02.870 --> 02:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:54:07.750 --> 02:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:09.750 --> 02:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
if i understand your question properly
 
02:54:14.790 --> 02:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
um the the components of what would be
 
02:54:17.429 --> 02:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
public and what would not be public is
 
02:54:19.910 --> 02:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
definitely a challenge so the policy
 
02:54:21.269 --> 02:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
would be public it would be something
 
02:54:23.349 --> 02:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
that we would publish publicly on our
 
02:54:23.359 --> 02:54:24.469 align:start position:0%
that we would publish publicly on our
website

02:54:24.469 --> 02:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
website
 
02:54:27.190 --> 02:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
however some procedures of how we handle
 
02:54:29.349 --> 02:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
the privacy and how we handle
 
02:54:29.359 --> 02:54:30.150 align:start position:0%
the privacy and how we handle
the

02:54:30.150 --> 02:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:54:33.510 --> 02:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
actions and milestones report of gaps
 
02:54:36.070 --> 02:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
and mitigation plans to
 
02:54:37.990 --> 02:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
to provide the procedures
 
02:54:39.750 --> 02:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
may not be public so that we don't
 
02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:41.349 align:start position:0%
may not be public so that we don't
unnecessarily

02:54:41.349 --> 02:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
 
02:54:41.359 --> 02:54:42.309 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
give

02:54:42.309 --> 02:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
give
 
02:54:44.309 --> 02:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
a person that doesn't have the best
 
02:54:45.990 --> 02:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
interests of the individuals or the
 
02:54:48.389 --> 02:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
systems that we operate in mind
 
02:54:51.670 --> 02:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
then the information to
 
02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
leverage that vulnerability against the
 
02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
once upon a time a long time ago i was
 
02:55:00.790 --> 02:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
considered an ethical hacker and i would
 
02:55:03.510 --> 02:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
use that information against people and
 
02:55:05.670 --> 02:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
show their vulnerabilities by hacking
 
02:55:07.510 --> 02:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
their system just with that social
 
02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
information that you're sharing of how
 
02:55:12.950 --> 02:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
you secure or provide privacy to systems
 
02:55:15.110 --> 02:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
so it's a really balanced a good
 
02:55:17.750 --> 02:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
balancing act to address
 
02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
but i certainly understand that the
 
02:55:22.309 --> 02:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
public hearing component of policy
 
02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
should be public and in recording that
 
02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:26.070 align:start position:0%
should be public and in recording that
component

02:55:26.070 --> 02:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
component
 
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:33.590 --> 02:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:55:36.230 --> 02:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and
 
02:55:38.309 --> 02:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
dennis goulet
 
02:55:40.389 --> 02:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
and on the bottom of the card it says do
 
02:55:42.550 --> 02:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
it and i've come to the conclusion that
 
02:55:45.830 --> 02:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
means department of information
 
02:55:49.750 --> 02:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:52.630 --> 02:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct mr chair
 
02:55:55.750 --> 02:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
my name is dennis goulet or duni goulet
 
02:55:58.389 --> 02:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:55:59.830 --> 02:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'm the commissioner for the department
 
02:56:02.950 --> 02:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
of information technology
 
02:56:05.190 --> 02:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh so first of all i want to thank
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative edwards for his
 
02:56:10.710 --> 02:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
leadership on this important issue um
 
02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
when i started in state government in
 
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
2015 there was not a single chief
 
02:56:19.030 --> 02:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
privacy officer in state government um
 
02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
and today there are 24 states that have
 
02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:21.670 align:start position:0%
and today there are 24 states that have
one

02:56:21.670 --> 02:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:56:23.910 --> 02:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
so it's you know that
 
02:56:25.750 --> 02:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know the importance of that has
 
02:56:27.190 --> 02:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
grown a lot
 
02:56:29.830 --> 02:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
um i i registered in opposition but as
 
02:56:31.830 --> 02:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
as mr weeders had pointed out with the
 
02:56:34.870 --> 02:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
with the proposed amendments um i would
 
02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
withdraw that opposition
 
02:56:39.510 --> 02:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
i did want to address i i'd spoken with
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative edwards about you know
 
02:56:43.110 --> 02:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
kind of the statewide approach and and
 
02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:43.910 align:start position:0%
kind of the statewide approach and and
we

02:56:43.910 --> 02:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:56:45.830 --> 02:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't necessarily agree on that but
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
i think we're we're trending in the
 
02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
right direction here in our discussions
 
02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:51.670 align:start position:0%
right direction here in our discussions
um

02:56:51.670 --> 02:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:53.910 --> 02:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
his focus was on hhs and i understand
 
02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
that it's it's half of what i do every
 
02:56:57.510 --> 02:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
day so
 
02:57:00.070 --> 02:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty big part of whole of state
 
02:57:02.550 --> 02:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
and the data that we collect in hhs is
 
02:57:05.030 --> 02:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
is you know significant so so i
 
02:57:07.429 --> 02:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
understand the attention there i wanted
 
02:57:10.150 --> 02:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
to bring up the the statewide concepts
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
there's some great questions that have
 
02:57:12.469 --> 02:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
come up and i think i may be able to
 
02:57:14.550 --> 02:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
help with the answers one of the things
 
02:57:17.030 --> 02:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
is is that i really would like to see a
 
02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:18.230 align:start position:0%
is is that i really would like to see a
structured

02:57:18.230 --> 02:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
structured
 
02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:21.590 align:start position:0%
structured
privacy

02:57:21.590 --> 02:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:57:24.309 --> 02:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
function in the state of new hampshire
 
02:57:27.030 --> 02:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
that has some accountability to it and
 
02:57:29.910 --> 02:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll contrast
 
02:57:31.830 --> 02:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
our cyber security structure because
 
02:57:33.510 --> 02:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's more mature it's been around
 
02:57:35.190 --> 02:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
02:57:37.110 --> 02:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i agree with representative edwards
 
02:57:39.429 --> 02:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
security and privacy are different so we
 
02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
have in the state a um cyber security
 
02:57:43.510 --> 02:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
advisory committee
 
02:57:46.230 --> 02:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
which is a it's not a public meeting it
 
02:57:48.150 --> 02:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
has representatives from all of the
 
02:57:49.910 --> 02:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
agencies as well as the other branches
 
02:57:52.150 --> 02:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
of government and what we do there is we
 
02:57:55.190 --> 02:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
vet cyber policy we communicate we share
 
02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
information we vet cyber policy and one
 
02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
of the vetting processes is
 
02:58:02.309 --> 02:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
hey we have this new thing we want to do
 
02:58:05.429 --> 02:58:05.439 align:start position:0%
to protect ourselves
 
02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
will this break anything
 
02:58:08.950 --> 02:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to you know i
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
heard the question come up um
 
02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
i think from weber was you know um you
 
02:58:15.990 --> 02:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
know what will get broken by this so and
 
02:58:17.269 --> 02:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes we think we have really good
 
02:58:19.110 --> 02:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
ideas and then we bring them up to there
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
and then and then these and the folks
 
02:58:22.870 --> 02:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
take it back to their agency leads and
 
02:58:24.870 --> 02:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
they say oh wait we can't do that this
 
02:58:26.389 --> 02:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
way because it'll break things but if we
 
02:58:27.990 --> 02:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
do it this way
 
02:58:30.070 --> 02:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
um it won't and that that helps achieve
 
02:58:31.990 --> 02:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
that balance between you know perfect
 
02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
cyber security would be i would just
 
02:58:35.830 --> 02:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
turn my computer off and leave it off
 
02:58:37.750 --> 02:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
and then i'd have great cyber security
 
02:58:39.590 --> 02:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
but i wouldn't be able to do anything
 
02:58:42.309 --> 02:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
privacy is similar uh in in that respect
 
02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
so we you know i think the idea of a
 
02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
statewide you know the doing in dhhs to
 
02:58:49.510 --> 02:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
start with maybe a good good start and
 
02:58:50.870 --> 02:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know i don't want to derail this
 
02:58:53.590 --> 02:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
bill but my vision would be to have in
 
02:58:56.230 --> 02:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
the have one that's um
 
02:58:59.590 --> 02:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's statewide and is empowered so in
 
02:59:01.590 --> 02:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
our enabling legislation the cyber
 
02:59:04.070 --> 02:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
security advisory committee is empowered
 
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
and then there's a secondary committee
 
02:59:07.990 --> 02:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
where we take these policies to which is
 
02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:08.870 align:start position:0%
where we take these policies to which is
the

02:59:08.870 --> 02:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:59:10.950 --> 02:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
information technology council which is
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
also in statute in
 
02:59:16.630 --> 02:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
rsa21r in the membership defined
 
02:59:16.640 --> 02:59:17.510 align:start position:0%
rsa21r in the membership defined
and

02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:20.309 --> 02:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to cr to create
 
02:59:20.319 --> 02:59:21.590 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to cr to create
policy

02:59:21.590 --> 02:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:59:23.349 --> 02:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
that's both you know the development of
 
02:59:25.349 --> 02:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
which is transparent so it is a public
 
02:59:25.359 --> 02:59:26.309 align:start position:0%
which is transparent so it is a public
meeting

02:59:26.309 --> 02:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:59:28.870 --> 02:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
we do go into non-public session when we
 
02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
discuss cyber specific cyber security
 
02:59:31.600 --> 02:59:32.790 align:start position:0%
discuss cyber specific cyber security
issues

02:59:32.790 --> 02:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:59:34.790 --> 02:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
um but but generally i try to share as
 
02:59:36.469 --> 02:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
much as i can
 
02:59:38.870 --> 02:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
in those meetings um so i think that
 
02:59:41.190 --> 02:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
structure is would potentially be a
 
02:59:43.830 --> 02:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
really good model for how we approach
 
02:59:45.269 --> 02:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
privacy in the state of new hampshire
 
02:59:47.429 --> 02:59:47.439 align:start position:0%
and maybe we take baby steps and we
 
02:59:50.070 --> 02:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
start out with dhhs
 
02:59:52.150 --> 02:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
my vision for the chief privacy officer
 
02:59:53.110 --> 02:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
is thus
 
02:59:53.120 --> 02:59:53.910 align:start position:0%
is thus
it

02:59:53.910 --> 02:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:59:56.150 --> 02:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
i would like it to be an appointed
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
non-classified position
 
03:00:01.830 --> 03:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
why appointed so so that the public has
 
03:00:03.910 --> 03:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for input through the
 
03:00:06.070 --> 03:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
through the governor's nomination and
 
03:00:07.670 --> 03:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
03:00:07.680 --> 03:00:09.030 align:start position:0%
executive council
process

03:00:09.030 --> 03:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:00:11.349 --> 03:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
because i think it's you know as as was
 
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
pointed out by multiple people this is
 
03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
this position is is very
 
03:00:18.389 --> 03:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
accountable to the directly to citizens
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so i think that having
 
03:00:22.790 --> 03:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
that transparency would be really good
 
03:00:24.389 --> 03:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:00:25.750 --> 03:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
so i'd love to see that and then i'd
 
03:00:27.910 --> 03:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
love to see us create a structure over
 
03:00:29.269 --> 03:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
time where we
 
03:00:30.389 --> 03:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
we have that
 
03:00:33.830 --> 03:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
dual layer governance one one layer is
 
03:00:33.840 --> 03:00:34.630 align:start position:0%
dual layer governance one one layer is
the

03:00:34.630 --> 03:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:00:36.389 --> 03:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
you know the overall like we cut we
 
03:00:37.830 --> 03:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
could call it a privacy advisory
 
03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:38.870 align:start position:0%
could call it a privacy advisory
committee

03:00:38.870 --> 03:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:00:41.429 --> 03:00:41.439 align:start position:0%
and then coming up to an already
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
established body which is the
 
03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
information technology council
 
03:00:47.910 --> 03:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
um and and and that body already is is
 
03:00:50.469 --> 03:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
has um
 
03:00:53.990 --> 03:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
authority to create policy
 
03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:54.790 align:start position:0%
authority to create policy
and

03:00:54.790 --> 03:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:00:57.510 --> 03:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
so that that concludes my testimony and
 
03:00:59.110 --> 03:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions there may
 
03:01:03.910 --> 03:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:05.429 --> 03:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you very
 
03:01:07.269 --> 03:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question i'm really
 
03:01:09.190 --> 03:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify
 
03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:10.710 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify
um

03:01:10.710 --> 03:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
i am very appreciative of trying to take
 
03:01:16.870 --> 03:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
a global vision of all of this and i
 
03:01:19.030 --> 03:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate it anytime anybody in state
 
03:01:21.190 --> 03:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
government tries to take a global vision
 
03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
rather than a siloed vision
 
03:01:27.990 --> 03:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
but i guess my question to you is
 
03:01:31.110 --> 03:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
are you saying that you
 
03:01:35.030 --> 03:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
want us to take this bill and transfer
 
03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:35.910 align:start position:0%
want us to take this bill and transfer
and

03:01:35.910 --> 03:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:01:39.030 --> 03:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
transform it into that global vision
 
03:01:41.670 --> 03:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
or are you just
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
is it okay to support the bill as it
 
03:01:46.469 --> 03:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
would be amended with representative
 
03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
edwards suggestions
 
03:01:50.950 --> 03:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
given that this is the health and human
 
03:01:52.790 --> 03:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
services committee
 
03:01:54.389 --> 03:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
and our
 
03:01:57.269 --> 03:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
mandate is the policy of health and
 
03:01:59.110 --> 03:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
human services
 
03:02:01.990 --> 03:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
not the delivery of i.t services to the
 
03:02:04.230 --> 03:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
entire state which
 
03:02:06.870 --> 03:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
most of us have rather less
 
03:02:09.750 --> 03:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications to address
 
03:02:10.710 --> 03:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:02:12.230 --> 03:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
while i was hearing testimony i was
 
03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:13.110 align:start position:0%
while i was hearing testimony i was
thinking

03:02:13.110 --> 03:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
03:02:17.110 --> 03:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
that that those very thoughts and
 
03:02:18.630 --> 03:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
i i think it would be perfectly
 
03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:19.830 align:start position:0%
i i think it would be perfectly
appropriate

03:02:19.830 --> 03:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:02:22.710 --> 03:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
particularly since you know hhs is like
 
03:02:26.309 --> 03:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
half of what i do every day that we
 
03:02:28.790 --> 03:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
that we go forward with this as you know
 
03:02:30.950 --> 03:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
as amended work collaboratively with
 
03:02:33.269 --> 03:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
representative edwards to amend it uh as
 
03:02:34.630 --> 03:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
as suggested
 
03:02:37.269 --> 03:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh talk about how we might um
 
03:02:39.190 --> 03:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
define the chief privacy officer maybe a
 
03:02:40.950 --> 03:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
little differently than we have but but
 
03:02:43.190 --> 03:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
kind of keep it you know not try to boil
 
03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
the ocean with it and then in next
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
session um i had been intending to
 
03:02:50.230 --> 03:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
try to bring forward some you know more
 
03:02:50.240 --> 03:02:51.510 align:start position:0%
try to bring forward some you know more
broad

03:02:51.510 --> 03:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
broad
 
03:02:54.469 --> 03:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
proposals uh in the next session um as
 
03:02:56.230 --> 03:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
part of the budget process so i think
 
03:02:58.070 --> 03:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
that would be an okay way to do it thank
 
03:02:59.910 --> 03:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
you follow up
 
03:03:03.030 --> 03:03:03.040 align:start position:0%

i appreciate this opportunity to come
 
03:40:16.870 --> 03:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
before you and present house bill 1619
 
03:40:18.790 --> 03:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
an act that will add migraine headaches
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
to the qualifying conditions for the
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
03:40:24.309 --> 03:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
this bill was drafted at the request of
 
03:40:26.710 --> 03:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
a constituent who has chronic migraine
 
03:40:28.950 --> 03:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
headaches and although she wants to do a
 
03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
trial with therapeutic cannabis she does
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
not want to trial with stigma
 
03:40:35.830 --> 03:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
when i told her she could be certified
 
03:40:37.510 --> 03:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
under chronic pain
 
03:40:39.429 --> 03:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
she shied away from the diagnosis of
 
03:40:42.070 --> 03:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
chronic pain because of the stigma
 
03:40:44.469 --> 03:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
i found that argument to be valid in my
 
03:40:46.550 --> 03:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
research she would apply
 
03:40:47.670 --> 03:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
she said
 
03:40:50.070 --> 03:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
if her condition were on the basis
 
03:40:51.750 --> 03:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
if it were on the list of qualifying
 
03:40:54.070 --> 03:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
conditions she was not comfortable being
 
03:40:56.150 --> 03:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
under the diagnosis of chronic pain
 
03:40:57.510 --> 03:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
situations that that can
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
make people think about you so stigma is
 
03:41:05.110 --> 03:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
already a serious issue for those in new
 
03:41:07.110 --> 03:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire seeking care for chronic pain
 
03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
the misuse of opiates is widely
 
03:41:10.870 --> 03:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
discouraged and patients are not always
 
03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
believed in their descriptions of their
 
03:41:12.479 --> 03:41:13.510 align:start position:0%
believed in their descriptions of their
pain

03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
pain
 
03:41:15.510 --> 03:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
alternative care though through our
 
03:41:17.510 --> 03:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
outstanding program is still a frontier
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
where patients
 
03:41:21.910 --> 03:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
encounter stigma including their own
 
03:41:23.590 --> 03:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
they may have a condition that causes
 
03:41:25.110 --> 03:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
them to be in chronic pain but they
 
03:41:27.030 --> 03:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't have that diagnosis which is an
 
03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
enumerated diagnosis in the idc 9
 
03:41:32.150 --> 03:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
chronic pain syndrome

03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
338.4
 
03:41:36.309 --> 03:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
i searched the medical literature for
 
03:41:38.389 --> 03:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
information about migraines
 
03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
and the potential to be have these
 
03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
symptoms alleviated
 
03:41:45.189 --> 03:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
and i have provided you an article that
 
03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
is an extensive literature review in
 
03:41:49.349 --> 03:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
your email it is not in front of you
 
03:41:51.030 --> 03:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
right now because i didn't make handouts
 
03:41:53.670 --> 03:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
for everyone and i apologize for that
 
03:41:53.680 --> 03:41:54.870 align:start position:0%
for everyone and i apologize for that
um

03:41:54.870 --> 03:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:58.870 --> 03:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:00.790 --> 03:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
this is a really comprehensive article
 
03:42:02.950 --> 03:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
and it can include citation that can
 
03:42:05.110 --> 03:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
lead you into a deeper look if you were
 
03:42:06.790 --> 03:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
to want to do that
 
03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i have also sent you some
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
information about stigma there's a
 
03:42:14.550 --> 03:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
handout that i sent to you as well
 
03:42:16.950 --> 03:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
i told my constituent that i would go
 
03:42:19.030 --> 03:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
ahead and file the bill because
 
03:42:20.229 --> 03:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
we want to see if we can get her
 
03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
diagnosis to be added so that she can
 
03:42:24.630 --> 03:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
walk into the dispensary and say what
 
03:42:28.950 --> 03:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
when i found when i um there was a long
 
03:42:33.510 --> 03:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
list of medications that she told me
 
03:42:35.429 --> 03:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
about that she has tried
 
03:42:37.189 --> 03:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
and i know personally as a migraine
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
sufferer that the side effects of of
 
03:42:41.910 --> 03:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
migraine medication are just profoundly
 
03:42:41.920 --> 03:42:43.110 align:start position:0%
migraine medication are just profoundly
disabling

03:42:43.110 --> 03:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
disabling
 
03:42:44.550 --> 03:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
depending on how
 
03:42:46.630 --> 03:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
difficult your migraines already are for
 
03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:47.429 align:start position:0%
difficult your migraines already are for
you

03:42:47.429 --> 03:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:42:49.110 --> 03:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
you're either seems to me like you're
 
03:42:51.429 --> 03:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
easily treated with something that's a
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
generic or you're on a ride where you
 
03:42:56.710 --> 03:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
have injections that cost 400 and up a
 
03:42:56.720 --> 03:42:57.910 align:start position:0%
have injections that cost 400 and up a
month

03:42:57.910 --> 03:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
month
 
03:43:00.070 --> 03:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
in order to try to control them and this
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
is on a trial basis which you may not
 
03:43:02.239 --> 03:43:03.110 align:start position:0%
is on a trial basis which you may not
have

03:43:03.110 --> 03:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:43:06.710 --> 03:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
the affordability to do
 
03:43:09.189 --> 03:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
so as state reps it is always awkward
 
03:43:12.389 --> 03:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
for me to testify before you and ask you
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
for a medical decision about matters but
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
we're very fortunate to have the tcp
 
03:43:21.910 --> 03:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board and um there are
 
03:43:24.389 --> 03:43:24.399 align:start position:0%
people from the tcp
 
03:43:26.550 --> 03:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
here in the room who can answer a lot of
 
03:43:28.389 --> 03:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
our questions
 
03:43:30.550 --> 03:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
the bill itself we've discussed several
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
times at the medical
 
03:43:35.750 --> 03:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
at the mob meetings and we tried to find
 
03:43:39.349 --> 03:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
an easier way to include people
 
03:43:43.030 --> 03:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
who have a a chronic or an issue
 
03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
that is so significant that they need
 
03:43:47.910 --> 03:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
alternative care and what we want to do
 
03:43:49.990 --> 03:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
is stop people from being deprived of
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
that care
 
03:43:53.590 --> 03:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
and in my friend's case
 
03:43:55.429 --> 03:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
the woman who came to me
 
03:43:55.439 --> 03:43:57.110 align:start position:0%
the woman who came to me
there's

03:43:57.110 --> 03:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:43:58.870 --> 03:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
four years into it she's still her
 
03:44:00.830 --> 03:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
headache every single day and she's a
 
03:44:00.840 --> 03:44:02.469 align:start position:0%
headache every single day and she's a
professional

03:44:02.469 --> 03:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
professional
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
she's an upstanding community person who
 
03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
is okay with being seen walking into the
 
03:44:10.309 --> 03:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
dispensary but not as a chronic pain
 
03:44:12.870 --> 03:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
patient but as a migraine sufferer
 
03:44:15.030 --> 03:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
where there are specific items in the
 
03:44:17.110 --> 03:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
dispensary that would be helpful to her
 
03:44:19.510 --> 03:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
that they know about so i'll take any
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have
 
03:44:23.670 --> 03:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
um and like i said there are experts
 
03:44:25.910 --> 03:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
here in the room um i do want to just
 
03:44:28.870 --> 03:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
quickly mention that
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
we all looked at this very carefully but
 
03:44:33.030 --> 03:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
it looks like what we're doing here is
 
03:44:34.469 --> 03:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
putting this
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
in as a symptom instead of as a
 
03:44:36.319 --> 03:44:37.670 align:start position:0%
in as a symptom instead of as a
diagnosis

03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
03:44:40.150 --> 03:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
so we will talk about how we could fix
 
03:44:40.160 --> 03:44:40.950 align:start position:0%
so we will talk about how we could fix
that

03:44:40.950 --> 03:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:42.150 --> 03:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
up the road
 
03:44:42.160 --> 03:44:48.710 align:start position:0%
up the road
um

03:44:48.710 --> 03:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:50.309 --> 03:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
representative gay

thank you
 
03:44:52.950 --> 03:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
03:44:56.389 --> 03:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of a migraine
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
i never thought of that as a symptom i
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
thought that was a condition
 
03:45:02.469 --> 03:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:45:04.790 --> 03:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
03:45:07.830 --> 03:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis of a migraine headache
 
03:45:07.840 --> 03:45:09.910 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis of a migraine headache
is

03:45:09.910 --> 03:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
it's a full spectrum of diagnostic
 
03:45:14.630 --> 03:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
criteria as far as i know that the
 
03:45:16.630 --> 03:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
clinician has to check off in order to
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
make the diagnosis
 
03:45:20.229 --> 03:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
as a symptom
 
03:45:22.710 --> 03:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
a migraine is not just a symptom it's a
 
03:45:24.790 --> 03:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a
 
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's a long-standing disorder for a lot
 
03:45:31.030 --> 03:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:33.429 --> 03:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
can be addressed by a lot of the
 
03:45:35.429 --> 03:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
items that they have in the dispensary
 
03:45:35.439 --> 03:45:36.870 align:start position:0%
items that they have in the dispensary
follow-up

03:45:36.870 --> 03:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:45:39.590 --> 03:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
so you think the wording here must be
 
03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
changed to be accurate i just think they
 
03:45:43.830 --> 03:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
put it
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to let people expand on that
 
03:45:46.950 --> 03:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
more but i really should have caught
 
03:45:49.429 --> 03:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
this because it talks about
 
03:45:52.309 --> 03:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
all these symptoms here instead of
 
03:45:55.110 --> 03:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
a diagnosis but we do have a list of
 
03:45:55.120 --> 03:45:57.269 align:start position:0%
a diagnosis but we do have a list of
conditions

03:45:57.269 --> 03:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
03:45:57.279 --> 03:45:58.229 align:start position:0%
conditions
and

03:45:58.229 --> 03:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:00.389 --> 03:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
those conditions
 
03:46:00.399 --> 03:46:02.070 align:start position:0%
those conditions
are

03:46:02.070 --> 03:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:46:04.229 --> 03:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
many of them diagnoses such as the
 
03:46:05.830 --> 03:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
chronic pain diagnosis the
 
03:46:10.630 --> 03:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:10.640 --> 03:46:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:46:11.910 --> 03:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
irritable bowel syndrome crohn's disease
 
03:46:17.670 --> 03:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
those kinds of diagnosis that have
 
03:46:19.910 --> 03:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
icd-9 definitions
 
03:46:21.269 --> 03:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
symptoms are part of the picture but
 
03:46:24.070 --> 03:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
they're not the diagnosis itself
 
03:46:25.670 --> 03:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
and i believe that we are going to have
 
03:46:27.830 --> 03:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
some medical oversight board information
 
03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
about that that you may be able to
 
03:46:32.229 --> 03:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
expand on that more
 
03:46:36.150 --> 03:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:37.510 --> 03:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think i will
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
hold my question until we have the
 
03:46:40.229 --> 03:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
expertise and
 
03:46:41.590 --> 03:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you enough
 
03:46:44.229 --> 03:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
for the representative
 
03:46:46.790 --> 03:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
03:46:46.800 --> 03:46:48.309 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative

03:46:50.309 --> 03:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much the chair
 
03:46:50.319 --> 03:46:52.389 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much the chair
recognizes

03:46:52.389 --> 03:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
recognizes
 
03:46:54.469 --> 03:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
we all recognize representative jerry
 
03:46:54.479 --> 03:46:56.790 align:start position:0%
we all recognize representative jerry
kanark

03:46:56.790 --> 03:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
kanark
 
03:46:59.510 --> 03:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
and he's from the tcmob which i'm going
 
03:47:02.550 --> 03:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
to say is therapeutic cannabis medical
 
03:47:07.510 --> 03:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:10.870 --> 03:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
first my apologies for trying to usurp
 
03:47:12.710 --> 03:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative vale's
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
time in the chair
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
all my bills have been going very early
 
03:47:18.150 --> 03:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm so used to introducing bills i
 
03:47:20.710 --> 03:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
forgot this is not mine to introduce
 
03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
so yes uh for the record jerry conor
 
03:47:24.550 --> 03:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
carroll county district three
 
03:47:25.990 --> 03:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm the chair in the legislative
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
liaison for the tcmob the therapeutic
 
03:47:32.550 --> 03:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board now
 
03:47:33.750 --> 03:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
first off
 
03:47:35.670 --> 03:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
you may notice this is what i handed out
 
03:47:37.030 --> 03:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
you may notice there's a lot of ink
 
03:47:38.710 --> 03:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
there because indeed there were some
 
03:47:40.229 --> 03:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
things we found after i'd already
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
prepared this and i will clarify those
 
03:47:43.670 --> 03:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
for you
 
03:47:45.030 --> 03:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
and because i'll be here for the
 
03:47:47.670 --> 03:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
executive session i don't need to you
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
know send you another version of it
 
03:47:51.910 --> 03:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
because i'll be able to explain it
 
03:47:53.830 --> 03:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
so first there's a lot of people that
 
03:47:55.189 --> 03:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
are new to this committee we haven't
 
03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
done a condition bill for a while
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis medic oversight
 
03:48:00.960 --> 03:48:01.910 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis medic oversight
board

03:48:01.910 --> 03:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:48:03.990 --> 03:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
is responsible for the oversight of the
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
clinical and the quality and the public
 
03:48:07.910 --> 03:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
health-related matters of the
 
03:48:09.429 --> 03:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program in new
 
03:48:09.439 --> 03:48:10.710 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program in new
hampshire

03:48:10.710 --> 03:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:48:12.630 --> 03:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
and tcmob is composed of the medical
 
03:48:14.790 --> 03:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
director of dhhs
 
03:48:17.349 --> 03:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
a can a rep patient representative an
 
03:48:20.150 --> 03:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
atc clinic atc's are the
 
03:48:21.670 --> 03:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh alternative treatment centers that's
 
03:48:23.670 --> 03:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
the dispensary an atc clinical
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
representative and 10 medical providers
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
representing different specialties i
 
03:48:30.070 --> 03:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
represent orthopedics and i serve as the
 
03:48:32.950 --> 03:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
chair and as the legislative liaison
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
so our job is to advise the legislature
 
03:48:37.510 --> 03:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
in dhhs at reviewing the medical and
 
03:48:39.189 --> 03:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence pertaining to
 
03:48:41.510 --> 03:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
proposing proposed qualifying conditions
 
03:48:42.389 --> 03:48:42.399 align:start position:0%
but also
 
03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
any other changes in the program which
 
03:48:46.950 --> 03:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
have clinical implications
 
03:48:49.750 --> 03:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
so because of this confusion
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
that representative gay was just asking
 
03:48:51.760 --> 03:48:52.710 align:start position:0%
that representative gay was just asking
about

03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
let me go into a little bit more detail
 
03:48:57.670 --> 03:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
patients are certified to use
 
03:49:01.110 --> 03:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis by their provider
 
03:49:02.710 --> 03:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
that's how the system works and you
 
03:49:04.389 --> 03:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
don't just walk in and say i want to do
 
03:49:05.910 --> 03:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
it you get certified to buy your
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
provider you're certified
 
03:49:11.269 --> 03:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
that you have a qualifying condition
 
03:49:13.590 --> 03:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
or symptom but
 
03:49:16.630 --> 03:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
sorry and the way the law was written
 
03:49:18.229 --> 03:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
and all the numbers are here on your
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
handout this part is correct
 
03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
you have to have a qualifying diagnosis
 
03:49:26.150 --> 03:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's under section one
 
03:49:28.150 --> 03:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
and a qualify and
 
03:49:31.110 --> 03:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
a qualifying symptom
 
03:49:31.120 --> 03:49:32.229 align:start position:0%
a qualifying symptom
or

03:49:32.229 --> 03:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:49:34.469 --> 03:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
some standalone conditions like ptsd and
 
03:49:36.550 --> 03:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
chronic pain and autism spectrum
 
03:49:36.560 --> 03:49:37.510 align:start position:0%
chronic pain and autism spectrum
disorder

03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
03:49:39.510 --> 03:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
those are standalones where we if you
 
03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
have that you don't have to have a qual
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
separate symptom
 
03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise the way the law was written
 
03:49:47.110 --> 03:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
and we're still living with is this and
 
03:49:49.110 --> 03:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
is the conjunction and that makes it a
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
little more confusing
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
and the point is
 
03:49:55.110 --> 03:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
yes uh to representative gay
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
migraine is a condition or a diagnosis
 
03:49:59.670 --> 03:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
it is not a symptom and that is a what i
 
03:50:01.349 --> 03:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
conceived to be probably a drafting
 
03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
error that it was put into section one
 
03:50:06.309 --> 03:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
it should have been in section 2 or be
 
03:50:10.790 --> 03:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
in the section b that's the 126-10
 
03:50:13.189 --> 03:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
number 1 9 b
 
03:50:14.950 --> 03:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
which are the standalone conditions that
 
03:50:17.510 --> 03:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
would have been more reasonable
 
03:50:19.750 --> 03:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
now when tcmob is going to consider
 
03:50:22.150 --> 03:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
adding a qualifying condition or symptom
 
03:50:23.429 --> 03:50:23.439 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
03:50:25.189 --> 03:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
our normal process is to go through a
 
03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
rather deep dive in the literature
 
03:50:30.389 --> 03:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
and hold a public hearing
 
03:50:32.710 --> 03:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
and then have a really robust discussion
 
03:50:34.229 --> 03:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
of whether is whether or not there is
 
03:50:35.830 --> 03:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient data
 
03:50:38.790 --> 03:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
to approve a condition or a symptom as a
 
03:50:41.269 --> 03:50:41.279 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition or symptom
 
03:50:43.189 --> 03:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis actually has a very low risk
 
03:50:43.199 --> 03:50:44.550 align:start position:0%
cannabis actually has a very low risk
profile

03:50:44.550 --> 03:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
profile
 
03:50:45.830 --> 03:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
and we have it approved for many
 
03:50:45.840 --> 03:50:47.670 align:start position:0%
and we have it approved for many
conditions

03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
03:50:49.269 --> 03:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
but it still should not be approved for
 
03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
any new conditions if there's not
 
03:50:52.550 --> 03:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
sufficient evidence
 
03:50:55.910 --> 03:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
that it's uh that it is usable and the
 
03:50:57.349 --> 03:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
reason for that is simply that it may
 
03:50:59.349 --> 03:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
displace then the use of more
 
03:51:01.189 --> 03:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
conventional treatments which may be
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
better for the person to use
 
03:51:04.870 --> 03:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's the same argument that i was making
 
03:51:06.550 --> 03:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
when i sat here talking about ivermectin
 
03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's the reason to consider whether
 
03:51:10.630 --> 03:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
you know you want to have real data
 
03:51:12.229 --> 03:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
before you suggest use because somebody
 
03:51:13.990 --> 03:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
may choose to use it rather than other
 
03:51:14.000 --> 03:51:15.590 align:start position:0%
may choose to use it rather than other
options

03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
options
 
03:51:17.910 --> 03:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
so in any case as we look at this
 
03:51:20.150 --> 03:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
tcmob did not go through a formal
 
03:51:24.710 --> 03:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
process of literature review and a
 
03:51:24.720 --> 03:51:25.670 align:start position:0%
process of literature review and a
hearing

03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:51:28.150 --> 03:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
on this proposal and the reason for that
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
is that we felt that this already fit
 
03:51:34.150 --> 03:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
under the stand-alone condition of
 
03:51:37.269 --> 03:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
moderate to severe chronic pain
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
the icd-11 international classification
 
03:51:42.389 --> 03:51:42.399 align:start position:0%
of diseases-11 which was just released
 
03:51:46.389 --> 03:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
in 2018 definition of chronic pain is
 
03:51:48.389 --> 03:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
chronic pain is pain that persists or
 
03:51:50.469 --> 03:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
recurs for longer than three months
 
03:51:52.710 --> 03:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's the definition
 
03:51:54.550 --> 03:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
and there are some categories
 
03:51:54.560 --> 03:51:56.229 align:start position:0%
and there are some categories
persistent

03:51:56.229 --> 03:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
persistent
 
03:51:56.239 --> 03:51:57.349 align:start position:0%
persistent
recurrent

03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
recurrent
 
03:52:00.309 --> 03:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
and persistent with overlaid attacks
 
03:52:02.150 --> 03:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
pain associated with migraine headaches
 
03:52:05.429 --> 03:52:05.439 align:start position:0%
meets the ic idc icd oh my goodness i
 
03:52:07.349 --> 03:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
did a typo i said nine
 
03:52:08.790 --> 03:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
i'm so used to nine because that's when
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
i was in practice we're using that one
 
03:52:13.030 --> 03:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
the icd-11 definition of chronic pain
 
03:52:14.469 --> 03:52:14.479 align:start position:0%
because when pain
 
03:52:16.229 --> 03:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
the pain is not always present that's
 
03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
the persistent but it often recurs over
 
03:52:20.870 --> 03:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
a period of more than three months
 
03:52:22.710 --> 03:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
so we felt it did not require
 
03:52:24.870 --> 03:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
independent statutory mention as a
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:29.910 --> 03:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
so again you notice i use the word again
 
03:52:29.920 --> 03:52:31.510 align:start position:0%
so again you notice i use the word again
condition

03:52:31.510 --> 03:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
condition
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
if we are going forward with this this
 
03:52:35.710 --> 03:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be moved to the
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
126-x colon 1 11b all those are the
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
various definitions one 126x1 of the
 
03:52:44.229 --> 03:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
definition section because those are the
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
standalone conditions or it needs to go
 
03:52:48.870 --> 03:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
in section uh
 
03:52:52.790 --> 03:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:52.800 --> 03:52:53.590 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

03:52:53.590 --> 03:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:52:55.590 --> 03:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
that 126 x
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
colon 1
 
03:52:59.429 --> 03:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
9 a 1. those are the conditions but i'll
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
be here to guide us through that concept
 
03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go ahead with it
 
03:53:05.750 --> 03:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's just a drafting issue
 
03:53:05.760 --> 03:53:06.830 align:start position:0%
that's just a drafting issue
um

03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:10.229 --> 03:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
now now it's time for the disclaimer
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
the disclaimer is that i have to point
 
03:53:14.229 --> 03:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
out that this recommendation for tcmob
 
03:53:17.429 --> 03:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
cannot be considered official
 
03:53:19.189 --> 03:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
because we were not able to vote on it
 
03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
due to our inability to meet an
 
03:53:24.229 --> 03:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
in-person quorum at our meeting
 
03:53:26.309 --> 03:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
most of the members of tcmob are medical
 
03:53:26.319 --> 03:53:28.229 align:start position:0%
most of the members of tcmob are medical
providers

03:53:28.229 --> 03:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
providers
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
on the day that we were trying to do
 
03:53:30.950 --> 03:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
this and actually even the previous one
 
03:53:33.269 --> 03:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
but on the most recent one some of them
 
03:53:34.550 --> 03:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
could not get out of their office in
 
03:53:36.150 --> 03:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
time to get to the meeting because of
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
clinical responsibilities we had people
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
who were covering for others because
 
03:53:41.990 --> 03:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
they were out for with covet
 
03:53:42.000 --> 03:53:43.030 align:start position:0%
they were out for with covet
and

03:53:43.030 --> 03:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:45.349 --> 03:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh and as would be expected with a group
 
03:53:47.269 --> 03:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
of responsible dedicated medical
 
03:53:49.349 --> 03:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
providers they also respect the need to
 
03:53:51.510 --> 03:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
limit in personal in-person meetings
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
during a coveted search
 
03:53:55.830 --> 03:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to they're
 
03:53:57.429 --> 03:53:57.439 align:start position:0%
working frontline with patients they
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
could be infected they don't want to
 
03:54:00.150 --> 03:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
bring it to a meeting they don't want to
 
03:54:01.510 --> 03:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
go to a meeting become infected then
 
03:54:03.429 --> 03:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
take it back to their patients
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is we did have a
 
03:54:08.469 --> 03:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
quorum if you include zoom but we know
 
03:54:10.630 --> 03:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
that that's not currently allowable
 
03:54:12.950 --> 03:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
and uh but if we
 
03:54:14.710 --> 03:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh if we
 
03:54:16.630 --> 03:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
so basically the refusal to use 21st
 
03:54:16.640 --> 03:54:18.309 align:start position:0%
so basically the refusal to use 21st
century

03:54:18.309 --> 03:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
century
 
03:54:20.710 --> 03:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
technology and zoom uh
 
03:54:23.110 --> 03:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
precludes us from reaching a good
 
03:54:25.030 --> 03:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
an actual official
 
03:54:27.110 --> 03:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
vote on this and we have actually for
 
03:54:28.630 --> 03:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
the last
 
03:54:30.790 --> 03:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh few months have not been able to meet
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
quorum because of these
 
03:54:34.150 --> 03:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
particular pressures
 
03:54:34.160 --> 03:54:35.269 align:start position:0%
particular pressures
so

03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:37.030 --> 03:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
we did not avoid doing the hearing
 
03:54:39.030 --> 03:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
because we thought we couldn't pull it
 
03:54:39.040 --> 03:54:39.910 align:start position:0%
because we thought we couldn't pull it
off

03:54:39.910 --> 03:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
off
 
03:54:41.670 --> 03:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
we just it's just the reality that i
 
03:54:43.189 --> 03:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
have to report to you that this is a
 
03:54:43.199 --> 03:54:44.550 align:start position:0%
have to report to you that this is a
discussion

03:54:44.550 --> 03:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:54:47.189 --> 03:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
we did not take a formal vote
 
03:54:49.269 --> 03:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh we might be able to someday
 
03:54:51.590 --> 03:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
so this is only our advice
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
and i'll take any questions if anybody
 
03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
have any
 
03:54:58.870 --> 03:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kirk and i'm
 
03:55:04.790 --> 03:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
really glad to see you sitting in that
 
03:55:07.910 --> 03:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
seat because you are
 
03:55:09.750 --> 03:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
an adept legislator and i have a
 
03:55:11.670 --> 03:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
legislative question
 
03:55:11.680 --> 03:55:12.630 align:start position:0%
legislative question
so

03:55:12.630 --> 03:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:15.590 --> 03:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
i am old enough to remember
 
03:55:18.150 --> 03:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh beginning two terms ago when we
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
started to hear
 
03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
a long list of bills
 
03:55:28.469 --> 03:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
each of which attempted to approve the
 
03:55:31.750 --> 03:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
use of cannabis for different medical
 
03:55:31.760 --> 03:55:33.349 align:start position:0%
use of cannabis for different medical
conditions

03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
03:55:33.359 --> 03:55:34.469 align:start position:0%
conditions
so

03:55:34.469 --> 03:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
my question is is this the best way
 
03:55:41.590 --> 03:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
for us to manage
 
03:55:44.710 --> 03:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
including cannabis as
 
03:55:47.110 --> 03:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
a therapeutic agent
 
03:55:50.710 --> 03:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
for this wide variety of conditions or
 
03:55:52.790 --> 03:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
is there a better way to do this that
 
03:55:56.309 --> 03:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
would take much less legislative time
 
03:55:58.469 --> 03:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
well actually if you read my report to
 
03:56:00.790 --> 03:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
dhhs oversight from back last april
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
you'll hear exactly that kind of comment
 
03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's what drove me nuts in that first
 
03:56:05.830 --> 03:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
year too as we were legislatively making
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
this decision i kept saying this does
 
03:56:08.870 --> 03:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
not make sense we don't have the
 
03:56:11.030 --> 03:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
expertise because i kept saying that i
 
03:56:12.550 --> 03:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
was invited in to be the co-sponsor for
 
03:56:14.229 --> 03:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
the bill that developed the therapy
 
03:56:15.670 --> 03:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board to
 
03:56:17.670 --> 03:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
advise the legislature from a medical
 
03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
point of view to be able to make these
 
03:56:20.389 --> 03:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
decisions since we don't really have
 
03:56:22.309 --> 03:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
that capacity
 
03:56:23.830 --> 03:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
but we're still stuck with the fact that
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
it still is a legislative decision
 
03:56:27.510 --> 03:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
unless we decide to completely
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
alter the statute and say that for
 
03:56:31.830 --> 03:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
example the board would make with
 
03:56:34.950 --> 03:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
decisions within dhhs and make all these
 
03:56:36.150 --> 03:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
decisions he wouldn't come back to the
 
03:56:37.830 --> 03:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
legislature but that's not how the law
 
03:56:40.950 --> 03:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:42.630 --> 03:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
any questions specific to the bill
 
03:56:45.269 --> 03:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
before us no good point
 
03:56:47.110 --> 03:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's a good point though
 
03:56:48.870 --> 03:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
03:56:50.389 --> 03:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:56:52.389 --> 03:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh is it possible that we could pass
 
03:56:54.870 --> 03:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
this conditionally upon the official
 
03:56:58.870 --> 03:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:01.830 --> 03:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
well actually back up you we can pass
 
03:57:03.830 --> 03:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
this we don't need because the tcup does
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
not you're not bound to follow what we
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
say we brought i brought back in a
 
03:57:09.670 --> 03:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation and six to four
 
03:57:12.229 --> 03:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation about sud in the past
 
03:57:15.269 --> 03:57:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh against it and the legislature passed
 
03:57:17.910 --> 03:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
it so we're not bound to do what tcmob
 
03:57:19.750 --> 03:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
says that's our what i strive to do in
 
03:57:21.189 --> 03:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
our meetings these days because these
 
03:57:23.830 --> 03:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
six force kind of splits are not helpful
 
03:57:26.229 --> 03:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
as we strive to finally reach consensus
 
03:57:28.150 --> 03:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
with either unanimous or new unanimous
 
03:57:29.830 --> 03:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
decision because then i can come back
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
with a strong recommendation that we
 
03:57:33.750 --> 03:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
beat to death the wording enough that we
 
03:57:35.830 --> 03:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
all agree on it and then you can trust
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
it and people are then it works quite
 
03:57:40.070 --> 03:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
well so we can pass this regardless of
 
03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
what tcmob says so don't worry about
 
03:57:42.790 --> 03:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
that part
 
03:57:44.870 --> 03:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to give you the
 
03:57:47.030 --> 03:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
nature of the talk we were concerned
 
03:57:48.870 --> 03:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
about trying to go into the detail of
 
03:57:51.189 --> 03:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
parsing out multiple issues of chronic
 
03:57:51.199 --> 03:57:52.150 align:start position:0%
parsing out multiple issues of chronic
pain

03:57:52.150 --> 03:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
pain
 
03:57:53.590 --> 03:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
i mean do we just keep going over and
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
over and over and we have to have a list
 
03:57:57.349 --> 03:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's going to be 20 pages long
 
03:57:59.830 --> 03:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
03:58:01.670 --> 03:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:58:03.590 --> 03:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question and i think your last
 
03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
sentence kind of got into what i was
 
03:58:08.469 --> 03:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
going to ask you which is
 
03:58:08.479 --> 03:58:12.469 align:start position:0%
going to ask you which is
uh

03:58:12.469 --> 03:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:12.479 --> 03:58:14.150 align:start position:0%
 
has

03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:58:17.750 --> 03:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:21.189 --> 03:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
taken any thought to what we heard from
 
03:58:23.910 --> 03:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative vale who represents that
 
03:58:25.830 --> 03:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
her constituent
 
03:58:27.910 --> 03:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
could actually qualify now for the
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
medical use of cannabis
 
03:58:33.910 --> 03:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
but she is concerned
 
03:58:37.269 --> 03:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
about the identifier that she would be
 
03:58:37.279 --> 03:58:38.710 align:start position:0%
about the identifier that she would be
using

03:58:38.710 --> 03:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
using
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
to obtain it and would prefer a
 
03:58:42.389 --> 03:58:42.399 align:start position:0%
different one and is that
 
03:58:44.950 --> 03:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
is that something we as a legislature
 
03:58:45.990 --> 03:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
should be
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
inquiring into or
 
03:58:50.469 --> 03:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
but but i what i really want to know is
 
03:58:52.389 --> 03:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
is it something that the board has
 
03:58:52.399 --> 03:58:54.150 align:start position:0%
is it something that the board has
considered

03:58:54.150 --> 03:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
considered
 
03:58:56.469 --> 03:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh dealing with somebody
 
03:58:59.590 --> 03:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
who's feeling the stigma of a particular
 
03:59:01.510 --> 03:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
i didn't realize there was a stigma
 
03:59:04.389 --> 03:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
attached so this is new new territory to
 
03:59:07.349 --> 03:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
me so if you want to have
 
03:59:08.790 --> 03:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
if she thinks she's got stigma with
 
03:59:10.070 --> 03:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
chronic pain maybe she goes on
 
03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
03:59:13.110 --> 03:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
that is one of the major things we've
 
03:59:15.030 --> 03:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
worked on in our last few months in the
 
03:59:17.670 --> 03:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
tcmob is working on trying to
 
03:59:19.750 --> 03:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
destigmatize therapeutic cannabis
 
03:59:21.429 --> 03:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
because therapeutic cannabis patients
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
are markedly stigmatized which is highly
 
03:59:27.189 --> 03:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunate um and there was a very
 
03:59:29.750 --> 03:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
nasty editorial on the concord monitor
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
and i think it was november i think it
 
03:59:33.590 --> 03:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
was which i had i responded and wrote
 
03:59:36.070 --> 03:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
another editorial about it because the
 
03:59:38.070 --> 03:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
guy was you know talking about
 
03:59:40.070 --> 03:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
smoking weed smoking pot and so on and
 
03:59:41.269 --> 03:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
03:59:41.279 --> 03:59:41.990 align:start position:0%
so forth
but

03:59:41.990 --> 03:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:59:43.750 --> 03:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
many is not much of the much of the
 
03:59:45.670 --> 03:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
products not smokeable and we use the
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
word cannabis it takes away some of that
 
03:59:50.150 --> 03:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
stigma the other issue is it's important
 
03:59:52.630 --> 03:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
is that no one else knows why you're
 
03:59:55.510 --> 03:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
certified this is not public knowledge
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's not on your card
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's uh
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
we just had a long talk about privacy
 
04:00:04.150 --> 04:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
that goes on your application it just
 
04:00:05.830 --> 04:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
all it is is just simply you have to be
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
able to have
 
04:00:09.189 --> 04:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
we have a check box you have to check
 
04:00:11.510 --> 04:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
off that the provider checks that off
 
04:00:13.830 --> 04:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
but otherwise this is not known you you
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
nobody knows it so the
 
04:00:17.110 --> 04:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
the only person is going to know it is
 
04:00:18.550 --> 04:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
going to be the department who processes
 
04:00:20.710 --> 04:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
your paperwork who's highly unlikely to
 
04:00:24.150 --> 04:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
know you um so i think that the stigma
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
she'll face much more stigma being on
 
04:00:29.070 --> 04:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:31.990 --> 04:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
04:00:36.790 --> 04:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:00:39.189 --> 04:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
a question about procedure about getting
 
04:00:43.030 --> 04:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
the card
 
04:00:45.429 --> 04:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
with a
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
for migraines
 
04:00:51.269 --> 04:00:51.279 align:start position:0%
if a person is seeing a neurologist and
 
04:00:53.429 --> 04:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
the neurologist said yeah you should
 
04:00:55.110 --> 04:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
give this a whirl
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
only that neurologist works for someone
 
04:00:59.670 --> 04:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
who will not
 
04:01:01.830 --> 04:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
allow that prescription
 
04:01:04.150 --> 04:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
does that person then have to go see
 
04:01:06.790 --> 04:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
another doctor for six months to
 
04:01:09.110 --> 04:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
establish a relationship before that
 
04:01:10.790 --> 04:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
doctor can then actually write the
 
04:01:13.670 --> 04:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
prescription okay several things oh well
 
04:01:15.590 --> 04:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm not yeah it's not a
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:21.429 --> 04:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
um that's number one number two is yes
 
04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
there are places where you cannot and
 
04:01:25.110 --> 04:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
you would then see a different provider
 
04:01:26.710 --> 04:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
um we are
 
04:01:28.630 --> 04:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
like we are we are in effect already not
 
04:01:30.790 --> 04:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
having the three-month wait correct
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
correct yeah we got rid of that no
 
04:01:33.830 --> 04:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
longer does there have to be that
 
04:01:36.150 --> 04:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
three-month uh issue because that was a
 
04:01:38.309 --> 04:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
little burdensome for people who had a
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
provider who refused then they had to go
 
04:01:41.910 --> 04:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that still is a problem
 
04:01:43.269 --> 04:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
because we don't maintain a list we do
 
04:01:46.070 --> 04:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
not publicize who certifies so the the
 
04:01:48.150 --> 04:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
person has to find out by the grapevine
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever who they can see who will
 
04:01:51.990 --> 04:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
certify them
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and actually by the way in
 
04:01:54.309 --> 04:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
that particular person they might go
 
04:01:56.150 --> 04:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
back to their pcp
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
who could certify them um but there are
 
04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
other people around the state who do
 
04:02:01.990 --> 04:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:02:03.030 --> 04:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
04:02:07.110 --> 04:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:08.469 --> 04:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you for
 
04:02:10.870 --> 04:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
taking the question representative
 
04:02:12.870 --> 04:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
so basically if i understand this
 
04:02:15.110 --> 04:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
following the conversation
 
04:02:18.550 --> 04:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
with an idc 11 which is basically
 
04:02:20.309 --> 04:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
chronic pain
 
04:02:22.150 --> 04:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really get into the subset
 
04:02:23.910 --> 04:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the reason for the pain
 
04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
which is coming from migraines and so
 
04:02:28.229 --> 04:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
forth does it matter yeah i mean i icd11
 
04:02:32.150 --> 04:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
is a giant book of 50 55 000 codes and
 
04:02:33.269 --> 04:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
this is simply so that you can
 
04:02:35.110 --> 04:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
communicate if you know you want to be
 
04:02:36.150 --> 04:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
code a diagnosis
 
04:02:40.630 --> 04:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
or a an injury and be able to
 
04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of research and all billing and
 
04:02:44.950 --> 04:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
everything else be able to communicate
 
04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
one another around the world it's an
 
04:02:49.830 --> 04:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
international uh classification and so
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
there'll be when the icd-9 is going to
 
04:02:54.070 --> 04:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
be a diagnostic code for pain there are
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
sub-categories for that for recurrent
 
04:02:58.870 --> 04:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
and for persistent and and so on and so
 
04:02:58.880 --> 04:03:00.630 align:start position:0%
and for persistent and and so on and so
forth

04:03:00.630 --> 04:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
forth
 
04:03:02.070 --> 04:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i'm trying to get to is
 
04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
that given that level of the pain with
 
04:03:08.150 --> 04:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
an idc or it 11 code is there any reason
 
04:03:10.870 --> 04:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
for us to get into the subsets
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
well yeah that's an interesting point
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
because the way we currently have the
 
04:03:16.469 --> 04:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
standalone right thing written is just
 
04:03:19.349 --> 04:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh chronic not order severe pain
 
04:03:21.030 --> 04:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
we don't go into all the various things
 
04:03:23.429 --> 04:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of intermittent pains
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
whether it be
 
04:03:28.469 --> 04:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
sickle cell osteogenesis imperfecta back
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
pain even back pain
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
often it's intermittent but it might be
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
there for years
 
04:03:34.870 --> 04:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
but the point is those are all chronic
 
04:03:36.550 --> 04:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
pain issues they'd all be classified
 
04:03:38.710 --> 04:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
that way and that's why tcmob felt that
 
04:03:40.229 --> 04:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
one didn't need to go through it we did
 
04:03:42.150 --> 04:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
respect the concern
 
04:03:43.510 --> 04:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
of stigma
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how much we talked
 
04:03:45.990 --> 04:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
about this
 
04:03:47.349 --> 04:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
in our meeting
 
04:03:49.590 --> 04:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
but we also again
 
04:03:50.630 --> 04:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
felt that
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is confidential information that
 
04:03:53.910 --> 04:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to know why you're
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
certified other than the people who push
 
04:03:58.950 --> 04:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
the paper over their tc program so that
 
04:04:01.990 --> 04:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know i think that's
 
04:04:03.750 --> 04:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
and that's not to dismiss i'm not trying
 
04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
to sound dismissive of this person's
 
04:04:05.439 --> 04:04:06.790 align:start position:0%
to sound dismissive of this person's
worries

04:04:06.790 --> 04:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
worries
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
because i think that would be that would
 
04:04:10.150 --> 04:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
be rude but it's simply it's
 
04:04:11.910 --> 04:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
confidential no one's going to know
 
04:04:13.670 --> 04:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
shelf h much more stigma by being on
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:18.790 --> 04:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
04:04:20.229 --> 04:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:04:22.469 --> 04:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
my question is about the awareness of
 
04:04:26.710 --> 04:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
this amongst the different subtypes of
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
chronic pain if the neurologist and
 
04:04:30.630 --> 04:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
everybody else who are treating people
 
04:04:32.309 --> 04:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
with migraine and these other
 
04:04:35.189 --> 04:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
indications are fully aware of its use
 
04:04:37.750 --> 04:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
or if there needs to be more done
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
that is a superb question
 
04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
and indeed after writing that editorial
 
04:04:45.030 --> 04:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
i've had a previous editorial i wrote in
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
our local paper and i got contacted by
 
04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
two people who happen to know me about
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
difficulties they've had getting
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
certified not just for migraine but for
 
04:04:54.389 --> 04:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
other chronic pain issues
 
04:04:56.389 --> 04:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
because of people not knowing so now
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
wind the clock back about a year
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
or over a year
 
04:05:01.269 --> 04:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
one of the major thrusts that we were
 
04:05:02.550 --> 04:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
working on and we just were getting
 
04:05:05.189 --> 04:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
started on it when uh coveted hit was
 
04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
working on an education program putting
 
04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
together a provider education program
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
which slide deck we called tc101
 
04:05:15.030 --> 04:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
all kinds of other stuff and my
 
04:05:18.309 --> 04:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
dream is to get out to all kinds of
 
04:05:21.750 --> 04:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
places the after medical society and
 
04:05:23.910 --> 04:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
pas and everybody else and give a lot of
 
04:05:25.349 --> 04:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
talks we already gave one at the
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
behavioral health summit
 
04:05:27.920 --> 04:05:28.950 align:start position:0%
behavioral health summit
virtually

04:05:28.950 --> 04:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
virtually
 
04:05:31.750 --> 04:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
but get out and do an education program
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of mis
 
04:05:36.229 --> 04:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
understandings amongst the providers
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
some of them even think oh well i can't
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
certify i've never been qualified to
 
04:05:39.600 --> 04:05:40.630 align:start position:0%
certify i've never been qualified to
certify

04:05:40.630 --> 04:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
certify
 
04:05:42.469 --> 04:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
no qualifications they don't want to be
 
04:05:44.950 --> 04:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
listed as a marijuana doc you know this
 
04:05:46.229 --> 04:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that the
 
04:05:47.830 --> 04:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
providers do not understand about how
 
04:05:49.670 --> 04:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
the program works and that is one of our
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
major things we got a little held behind
 
04:05:53.590 --> 04:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
until we got our educational pieces done
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're just about finalized on the slides
 
04:05:57.269 --> 04:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
and we have not had the chance to get
 
04:05:59.429 --> 04:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
out to the pub to the provider
 
04:06:01.429 --> 04:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
people to do that but that is a major
 
04:06:01.439 --> 04:06:02.309 align:start position:0%
people to do that but that is a major
issue

04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
so i mean i've volunteered to these
 
04:06:05.110 --> 04:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
other people that i will reach out to
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
their providers and explain this to them
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
and the department will do that as well
 
04:06:11.910 --> 04:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
but there is a high level of ignorance
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
amongst the providers as far as how this
 
04:06:15.670 --> 04:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
program works
 
04:06:17.349 --> 04:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:06:21.910 --> 04:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:24.550 --> 04:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
what is the mountain that has to be
 
04:06:24.560 --> 04:06:25.590 align:start position:0%
what is the mountain that has to be
moved

04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
moved
 
04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:06:29.670 --> 04:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
the different components of medical
 
04:06:32.950 --> 04:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
marijuana can be isolated put in pills
 
04:06:34.070 --> 04:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
people can
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
get them
 
04:06:37.590 --> 04:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
the chemicals that they want instead of
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
having to learn
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
some name of some particular
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
kind of marijuana right yeah what
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
how many million things do we have to
 
04:06:50.150 --> 04:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
accomplish before that can happen the
 
04:06:52.870 --> 04:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
major burden or barrier to that is these
 
04:06:55.110 --> 04:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
titles the schedule one classification
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
of of cannabis
 
04:06:57.990 --> 04:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason
 
04:07:00.150 --> 04:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
when that's schedule one it means you
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
cannot get it easily to do research
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
so that has been a major problem there
 
04:07:06.550 --> 04:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
are some components that are
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
approved epidiolex is a cbd at a very
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
high concentration that is used in
 
04:07:13.830 --> 04:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
intractable seizure disorders in kids
 
04:07:16.389 --> 04:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
um we also have some other ones marinol
 
04:07:18.309 --> 04:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
side effects some other things that are
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
derived but the point is there's
 
04:07:23.110 --> 04:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of our research comes from other
 
04:07:25.110 --> 04:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
countries but we do have some that does
 
04:07:26.630 --> 04:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
come here because there are some places
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
where cannabis has officially grown to
 
04:07:29.910 --> 04:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
be used but we're getting a little far
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
afield here but the bottom line is
 
04:07:33.269 --> 04:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
that's the mountain that has to be moved
 
04:07:35.189 --> 04:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
for us to get better data
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
but there is already some pretty good
 
04:07:38.550 --> 04:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
data institutional medicine published a
 
04:07:41.030 --> 04:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
large thing in 2017 that did identify
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
and what the literature does show and it
 
04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
keeps getting updated
 
04:07:46.309 --> 04:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
so the the problem is actually the
 
04:07:48.070 --> 04:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
regulatory issue at the federal level is
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
the primary issue thank you
 
04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
04:07:53.439 --> 04:07:55.110 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
representative

04:07:55.110 --> 04:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:56.790 --> 04:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
04:07:58.630 --> 04:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
and i'll also point out mike holt is
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
here he did not plan to testify but if
 
04:08:02.149 --> 04:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
there are questions or if i screwed
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
something up he can clarify it
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
i didn't see any negative reactions
 
04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
behind you representative acton
 
04:08:12.550 --> 04:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you mr chair and um thank
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
you uh representative for for all you've
 
04:08:17.189 --> 04:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
done for over what's been a decade
 
04:08:19.590 --> 04:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
that we've been pushing this um
 
04:08:22.710 --> 04:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
since mr holt push it pushing pushing
 
04:08:26.309 --> 04:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
working on it sir working diligently
 
04:08:27.910 --> 04:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
and i've only been working on it for
 
04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:35.830 --> 04:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
yes you have served
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
all right um since mr holtz is not
 
04:08:39.750 --> 04:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
testimony i just wanted to ask maybe he
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
can give us some information
 
04:08:43.630 --> 04:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
are there people currently
 
04:08:46.389 --> 04:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
diagnosed um
 
04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
or currently qualifying
 
04:08:52.229 --> 04:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
as chronic pain with my migraine as
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
their condition is that currently taking
 
04:08:54.239 --> 04:08:55.830 align:start position:0%
their condition is that currently taking
place

04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's highly likely but since the
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
box that will be checked on the
 
04:09:01.830 --> 04:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
application form just says chronic pain
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't know that i because
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis came in right after
 
04:09:09.429 --> 04:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
i stopped practice but i kept up with
 
04:09:11.429 --> 04:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite getting feedback here kept
 
04:09:13.269 --> 04:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
up with some of my patients and one of
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
them went off i tried to get him off
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
opioids couldn't do it he finally got on
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
tc was able to come off as opioids he
 
04:09:20.229 --> 04:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
lives in the same town i'd see him every
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
now and then
 
04:09:23.830 --> 04:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
but the the point is he's got back pain
 
04:09:25.429 --> 04:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
back pain isn't listed as a condition
 
04:09:27.030 --> 04:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
but it's a chronic pain
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
so the chronic pain
 
04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
accounts for over half of our qualifying
 
04:09:32.159 --> 04:09:33.670 align:start position:0%
accounts for over half of our qualifying
patients

04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
patients
 
04:09:36.950 --> 04:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
so that is a big deal and there's i'm
 
04:09:39.189 --> 04:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
sure there are dozens if not hundreds of
 
04:09:40.469 --> 04:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
people with migraine that probably are
 
04:09:41.590 --> 04:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
in there but we would have no way to
 
04:09:43.110 --> 04:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
know because we don't
 
04:09:44.790 --> 04:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
drill down that's why this
 
04:09:46.469 --> 04:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
information is confidential no one's
 
04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
going to know it because we don't track
 
04:09:47.680 --> 04:09:48.950 align:start position:0%
going to know it because we don't track
that

04:09:48.950 --> 04:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:50.309 --> 04:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:09:52.710 --> 04:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
if we do well i mean her concern was
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
being known as chronic pain but that we
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
still don't track that with this
 
04:09:57.750 --> 04:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
de-identified data we don't have that
 
04:10:00.070 --> 04:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
information and just also to clarify for
 
04:10:00.080 --> 04:10:00.950 align:start position:0%
information and just also to clarify for
people

04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
the primary age of people that are
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
qualified are in the 50s and 60s he's
 
04:10:07.030 --> 04:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
not a bunch of they're not a bunch of
 
04:10:09.189 --> 04:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
adolescent smokers they're very few kids
 
04:10:11.189 --> 04:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
that are under age 18 they're certified
 
04:10:12.550 --> 04:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
because it's a very high barrier for
 
04:10:13.830 --> 04:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
them with two
 
04:10:16.630 --> 04:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
certifying providers and uh guardian so
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
on and so forth the issue is that it's
 
04:10:20.149 --> 04:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
people like us
 
04:10:21.990 --> 04:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
most of them with pain that's the one
 
04:10:23.269 --> 04:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
the major issues and a lot of other
 
04:10:25.349 --> 04:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
issues as well
 
04:10:26.950 --> 04:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for the
 
04:10:26.960 --> 04:10:31.590 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for the
representative

04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:33.429 --> 04:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much i have no
 
04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
other pink cards can i appoint you as a
 
04:10:44.550 --> 04:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:46.630 --> 04:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes um but i think one of
 
04:10:50.070 --> 04:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:51.510 --> 04:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to word this this
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
weather because again you don't have to
 
04:10:56.229 --> 04:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
do at all what we said in tcmob uh we
 
04:10:57.510 --> 04:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
have to decide
 
04:10:59.349 --> 04:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
whether we do want to get into this
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
parsing of different types
 
04:11:01.439 --> 04:11:02.229 align:start position:0%
parsing of different types
of

04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:11:05.750 --> 04:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
pain syndromes and listing them
 
04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:13.030 --> 04:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
look you qualify and we're not going to
 
04:11:17.110 --> 04:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
expand it out and again tcm will be
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
didn't really want to get all the kind
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
of detail and make a recommendation on
 
04:11:21.750 --> 04:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
that part because that's really more i
 
04:11:24.389 --> 04:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
think something we have to decide
 
04:11:24.399 --> 04:11:25.670 align:start position:0%
think something we have to decide
and

04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:27.110 --> 04:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
i would like some guidance from the
 
04:11:29.110 --> 04:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
group i don't want to form it i don't
 
04:11:30.469 --> 04:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
want to be a committee of one making a
 
04:11:30.479 --> 04:11:31.750 align:start position:0%
want to be a committee of one making a
decision

04:11:31.750 --> 04:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
represent taking a question
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
my concern is can you speak to this if
 
04:11:43.510 --> 04:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
we start listing the subsets of chronic
 
04:11:43.520 --> 04:11:44.389 align:start position:0%
we start listing the subsets of chronic
pain

04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
pain
 
04:11:46.630 --> 04:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
do we run the risk of not then being
 
04:11:48.309 --> 04:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
inclusive with everything that possibly
 
04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
could happen
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
because i know enough about idc 9 codes
 
04:11:53.510 --> 04:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
or actually 11 codes now if you keep it
 
04:11:55.750 --> 04:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
at the higher level you cover a lot more
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
things getting into the specifics
 
04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
underneath this so the question to you
 
04:12:00.469 --> 04:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
are we better off with the high level
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
versus trying to go through and lose
 
04:12:03.990 --> 04:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
every single chronic pain
 
04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
my personal opinion and i have to say
 
04:12:08.309 --> 04:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not speaking for the board here
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
because we did not take a vote on that
 
04:12:12.550 --> 04:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
particular question so this is me
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
um i agree with you i think keeping the
 
04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
30 000 foot view according to
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative woods would probably be
 
04:12:21.910 --> 04:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
smarter because it's much more inclusive
 
04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that if we do have
 
04:12:26.389 --> 04:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
that list you say including
 
04:12:28.630 --> 04:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
so-and-so including blah blah blah blah
 
04:12:29.910 --> 04:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
people are going to look at and say well
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
blah blah is not on there so i guess
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
probably not and therefore i'm not going
 
04:12:35.429 --> 04:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
to certify you and that list if we
 
04:12:37.590 --> 04:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
decided to put all on could be
 
04:12:40.710 --> 04:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
thousands of things so it becomes very
 
04:12:43.349 --> 04:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and that might become
 
04:12:46.070 --> 04:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
a more of a barrier for certification
 
04:12:47.830 --> 04:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
because the provider wouldn't wade
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
through all that stuff
 
04:12:52.870 --> 04:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
so i i personally but again speaking
 
04:12:54.550 --> 04:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
personally i think it makes more sense
 
04:12:58.149 --> 04:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
to leave it as just chronic pain and and
 
04:13:00.070 --> 04:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
advise the patient
 
04:13:02.229 --> 04:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh in this particular case that it's
 
04:13:03.750 --> 04:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
confidential information and no one's
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
gonna know that she's certified under
 
04:13:06.550 --> 04:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
chronic pain she's just gonna have a
 
04:13:08.710 --> 04:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
card that allows her to get in when you
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
go on the thing they may ask
 
04:13:12.389 --> 04:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
you know you'll work with the atc they
 
04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
will find out well what's your pain kind
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
of thing because that that helps them
 
04:13:19.189 --> 04:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
decide which um mix they want to use
 
04:13:21.030 --> 04:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
which product they want to use
 
04:13:22.469 --> 04:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
but by this you know in terms of
 
04:13:25.349 --> 04:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
delivery and in terms of mix of thc cbd
 
04:13:28.149 --> 04:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
but the issue is that's again like it
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
with a medical provider that's
 
04:13:30.710 --> 04:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
confidential they're not going to go out
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
and blab and say oh i saw someone
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
someone guess what she's got migraines
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
they don't do that
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:13:38.710 --> 04:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
so it's you know you walk in there if
 
04:13:40.229 --> 04:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
you've ever if you've ever been in an
 
04:13:41.429 --> 04:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
atc it's
 
04:13:43.510 --> 04:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's really rather impressive they're
 
04:13:45.990 --> 04:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
not they're not the local pot shops they
 
04:13:47.510 --> 04:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
you walk in it looks like you're in a
 
04:13:49.349 --> 04:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
high-tech uh
 
04:13:49.359 --> 04:13:50.389 align:start position:0%
high-tech uh
um

04:13:50.389 --> 04:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:52.630 --> 04:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
pharmacy with a different kind of
 
04:13:52.640 --> 04:13:56.389 align:start position:0%
pharmacy with a different kind of
product

04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:03.510 --> 04:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering since the um since i'm
 
04:14:04.950 --> 04:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
trying to address whether there should
 
04:14:06.710 --> 04:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
be this amendment or not we're really
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
getting into an executive session yes we
 
04:14:10.870 --> 04:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
are maybe we should have someone draft
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
an amendment and bring it to the
 
04:14:13.910 --> 04:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
executive session and then we can have
 
04:14:15.429 --> 04:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
this discussion
 
04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
then and decide whether to

parse that out if there's somebody here
 
04:14:30.149 --> 04:14:30.159 align:start position:0%

better
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
so if
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%

representing cheshire 16
 
04:17:15.910 --> 04:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:18.389 --> 04:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
this is a simple bill albeit a difficult
 
04:17:20.070 --> 04:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
one to understand if you were just to
 
04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
read it
 
04:17:23.910 --> 04:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
it will increase health care access to a
 
04:17:26.070 --> 04:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
small group of marginalized new
 
04:17:28.790 --> 04:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents
 
04:17:36.830 --> 04:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
microphone okay
 
04:17:42.389 --> 04:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
in 1996 the personal responsibility and
 
04:17:45.429 --> 04:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
work opportunity reconciliation act was
 
04:17:47.910 --> 04:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
signed into law by then president
 
04:17:49.269 --> 04:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
bill clinton
 
04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
the bill commonly referred to as the
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
welfare reform act imposed a five-year
 
04:17:55.990 --> 04:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
waiting period for certain immigrants to
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
be eligible for a variety of federal
 
04:17:58.080 --> 04:17:59.670 align:start position:0%
be eligible for a variety of federal
benefits

04:17:59.670 --> 04:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
04:18:01.510 --> 04:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
therefore many new hampshire immigrants
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
today must wait five years to qualify
 
04:18:06.550 --> 04:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
for medicaid and children's health
 
04:18:09.750 --> 04:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
insurance plan known as chip
 
04:18:12.309 --> 04:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
in 2009 however the federal government
 
04:18:14.469 --> 04:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
created an option for states
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
to eliminate that five-year wait for
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
children and pregnant
 
04:18:20.790 --> 04:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
people who are lawfully residing in the
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
u.s but not yet permanent
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
citizens permanent residents or citizens
 
04:18:28.630 --> 04:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
each of you should have a map in front
 
04:18:31.110 --> 04:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
of you that indicates that new hampshire
 
04:18:34.630 --> 04:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
is the only state in the northeast
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
and one of only 17 states nationwide
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
that has not yet taken this option
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
this bill if passed will require new
 
04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire to amend its medicaid state
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
plan to provide coverage for otherwise
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
eligible children and pregnant people
 
04:18:53.349 --> 04:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
that means that this will waive the
 
04:18:54.950 --> 04:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
five-year wait
 
04:18:54.960 --> 04:18:55.910 align:start position:0%
five-year wait
but

04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
people who apply for medicaid will still
 
04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
have to be eligible based on income
 
04:19:04.469 --> 04:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
along with my testimony and the
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
aforementioned map you should also have
 
04:19:09.030 --> 04:19:09.040 align:start position:0%

04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
among other things it lists various

immigration statuses that are considered
 
04:19:21.429 --> 04:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
lawfully residing and you'll see that on
 
04:19:24.630 --> 04:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:26.710 --> 04:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
while many categories are included the
 
04:19:29.110 --> 04:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
largest number of affected people will
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
be those who have recently been granted

result in health care coverage for a

hello my name is sandra neckencore
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
a nigerian immigrant married with three
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
children two boys and a girl
 
04:22:22.469 --> 04:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
i am writing to support hb 1578 which
 
04:22:24.149 --> 04:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
will allow pregnant immigrants and
 
04:22:26.710 --> 04:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
minors to get health care
 
04:22:29.429 --> 04:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
when i became pregnant in august 2017 i
 
04:22:32.790 --> 04:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
was living in dallas texas i was able to
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
apply for a type of medical insurance
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
through the state which is like medicaid
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
that insurance covered both my unborn
 
04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
child and me and included postnatal
 
04:22:44.870 --> 04:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
visits as well
 
04:22:47.110 --> 04:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
i was so relieved because i
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
didn't have to come up with six thousand
 
04:22:52.469 --> 04:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
dollars or more for hospital bills
 
04:22:56.790 --> 04:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
my husband was placed in immigration
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
detention and transferred to stratfor
 
04:23:03.910 --> 04:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
county jail in new hampshire
 
04:23:06.070 --> 04:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
that meant that my two boys and i needed
 
04:23:08.469 --> 04:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
to come to new hampshire
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
before we can make a decision to come
 
04:23:12.870 --> 04:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
the immigrant and refugee support group
 
04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire conference
 
04:23:16.790 --> 04:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
united church of christ had to look for
 
04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
an obstetrician that was willing to take
 
04:23:20.790 --> 04:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
care of me and help me with the delivery
 
04:23:20.800 --> 04:23:22.309 align:start position:0%
care of me and help me with the delivery
process

04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
fortunately the group found dr perkins
 
04:23:27.429 --> 04:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
garrison women's health offered to
 
04:23:29.590 --> 04:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
donate their services for my prenatal
 
04:23:31.990 --> 04:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
and postnatal care because the state of
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does not have any program
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
that covers pregnant immigrants
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
my boys who were three and nearly five
 
04:23:42.229 --> 04:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
at that point couldn't get any medical
 
04:23:45.269 --> 04:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
insurance through the state either
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm very grateful for the help offered
 
04:23:49.510 --> 04:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
to me and my family by the immigrant and
 
04:23:51.429 --> 04:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
refugee support group and garrison
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
women's health
 
04:23:54.710 --> 04:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
i recently learned that the reason they
 
04:23:56.469 --> 04:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
needed to help me was that the state of
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hasn't opted into the same
 
04:24:01.510 --> 04:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
federal program that was available in
 
04:24:01.520 --> 04:24:03.429 align:start position:0%
federal program that was available in
texas

04:24:03.429 --> 04:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
texas
 
04:24:07.269 --> 04:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
my family was recently granted asylum
 
04:24:09.189 --> 04:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
during the wait i earned my
 
04:24:11.110 --> 04:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
certification to be a licensed nursing
 
04:24:11.120 --> 04:24:12.229 align:start position:0%
certification to be a licensed nursing
assistant

04:24:12.229 --> 04:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
04:24:13.990 --> 04:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
now i work as an
 
04:24:17.269 --> 04:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
lna because i love helping people
 
04:24:19.510 --> 04:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
i work in a nursing home and sing for my
 
04:24:22.070 --> 04:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
patients to make them happy
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
i am also taking classes at great bay so
 
04:24:26.710 --> 04:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
i can become a nurse probably in three
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
years time
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
i hope that the state of new hampshire
 
04:24:32.790 --> 04:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
will opt into the federal program
 
04:24:34.790 --> 04:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
more immigrant health workers like me
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
are needed in new hampshire and having
 
04:24:39.110 --> 04:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
this insurance available would be one
 
04:24:42.070 --> 04:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
less obstacle to their coming
 
04:24:44.309 --> 04:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
it's only by god's grace in the form of
 
04:24:46.229 --> 04:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
the immigrant and refugee support group
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
and garrison women's garrison women's
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
health center that we made it here
 
04:24:59.189 --> 04:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.149 --> 04:25:04.159 align:start position:0%

would you like me to tell you
 
04:25:29.670 --> 04:25:29.680 align:start position:0%

with that letter in it into their
 
04:25:34.710 --> 04:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
legislative email addresses so they can
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
actually go into their emails and read
 
04:25:38.710 --> 04:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
it and keep it for themselves
 
04:25:41.189 --> 04:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
would you like me to tell you that
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:49.830 --> 04:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:52.469 --> 04:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair women and also
 
04:25:54.149 --> 04:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
representatives three of taking my
 
04:25:55.510 --> 04:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
question i want to read a comment and
 
04:25:58.469 --> 04:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:00.630 --> 04:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
my comment is this prenatal care has
 
04:26:01.990 --> 04:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
been shown to be cost effective by
 
04:26:03.750 --> 04:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
decreasing medical costs associated with
 
04:26:06.550 --> 04:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
low to non-existent prenatal care
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
once a child is born does that child
 
04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
qualify for services as they are now a
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
u.s citizen of the 14th amendment of our
 
04:26:13.040 --> 04:26:14.229 align:start position:0%
u.s citizen of the 14th amendment of our
constitution

04:26:14.229 --> 04:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
04:26:15.990 --> 04:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
therefore is it better for the state to
 
04:26:17.830 --> 04:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
be providing prenatal care to a child
 
04:26:20.710 --> 04:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
versus having children become subject to
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
low prenatal care which ultimately could
 
04:26:24.070 --> 04:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
cost the state a lot more money in the
 
04:26:30.389 --> 04:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:32.229 --> 04:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
you sound a little bit like you're under
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
water um so but
 
04:26:37.590 --> 04:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's my scuba mask i'll take it off
 
04:26:39.110 --> 04:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
so i understand that that wasn't a
 
04:26:39.120 --> 04:26:40.309 align:start position:0%
so i understand that that wasn't a
question

04:26:40.309 --> 04:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
the question is in your opinion is the
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
state in a better position
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
to provide prenatal care to these
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
individuals because once the child was
 
04:26:48.960 --> 04:26:50.229 align:start position:0%
individuals because once the child was
born

04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
born
 
04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
they become a u.s citizen by the 14th
 
04:26:54.550 --> 04:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
amendment and therefore if we ignore
 
04:26:57.269 --> 04:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
prenatal care in these individuals
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
and we have children born that have
 
04:26:59.279 --> 04:27:00.229 align:start position:0%
and we have children born that have
higher

04:27:00.229 --> 04:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
density of
 
04:27:04.149 --> 04:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
problems medical wise that the state is
 
04:27:05.750 --> 04:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
actually better off to provide the money
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
on the front end taking care of the care
 
04:27:09.110 --> 04:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
versus the back end taking care of a
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
child who needs medical care long term
 
04:27:14.229 --> 04:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
yes i agree and i think that everyone
 
04:27:14.239 --> 04:27:16.229 align:start position:0%
yes i agree and i think that everyone
would

04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:27:19.830 --> 04:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
i think that everyone would agree that
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
specifically health care for children
 
04:27:22.560 --> 04:27:23.590 align:start position:0%
specifically health care for children
and

04:27:23.590 --> 04:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
prenatal health care for pregnant people
 
04:27:27.429 --> 04:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
is a
 
04:27:29.429 --> 04:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
very good investment not only in public
 
04:27:30.630 --> 04:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
health and in
 
04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
individuals health but also financially
 
04:27:38.469 --> 04:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:27:43.189 --> 04:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you representative for
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:27:47.830 --> 04:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
so it appears to me that the is it
 
04:27:49.590 --> 04:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
correct that the
 
04:27:51.429 --> 04:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
people still receiving care they're just
 
04:27:53.110 --> 04:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
doing it through the
 
04:27:55.510 --> 04:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
um you know through the
 
04:27:57.750 --> 04:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
whatever they you know indigent care you
 
04:27:59.349 --> 04:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
know they're not they're not in the
 
04:28:01.590 --> 04:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
program they're not on medicaid but they
 
04:28:04.070 --> 04:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
still go to the facility or are they
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
just not
 
04:28:07.590 --> 04:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
receiving healthcare
 
04:28:07.600 --> 04:28:08.790 align:start position:0%
receiving healthcare
so

04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:08.800 --> 04:28:09.990 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:28:09.990 --> 04:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:13.830 --> 04:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
before i started contacting people
 
04:28:13.840 --> 04:28:16.070 align:start position:0%
before i started contacting people
um

04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:18.309 --> 04:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
about this bill to get to try to get
 
04:28:20.309 --> 04:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
more information i had never had any
 
04:28:22.149 --> 04:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
contact with amiskegh
 
04:28:22.159 --> 04:28:23.189 align:start position:0%
contact with amiskegh
health

04:28:23.189 --> 04:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
health
 
04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
which is a large
 
04:28:27.269 --> 04:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
federally qualified health center in
 
04:28:30.790 --> 04:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
manchester serve a lot of immigrants
 
04:28:33.510 --> 04:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know speaking of interpreters they i
 
04:28:36.389 --> 04:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
can't remember exactly what the ceo told
 
04:28:37.750 --> 04:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
me but
 
04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
like they serve people speaking 60
 
04:28:42.550 --> 04:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
different languages
 
04:28:42.560 --> 04:28:43.349 align:start position:0%
different languages
so

04:28:43.349 --> 04:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:45.030 --> 04:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
the answer to your question is
 
04:28:48.070 --> 04:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
undetermined but i would assume
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
that some people
 
04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
who do not have health care coverage
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
are receiving unreimbursed care from
 
04:29:00.309 --> 04:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
various places
 
04:29:02.309 --> 04:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
i know that cheshire medical center in
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
keene has somebody who specifically
 
04:29:07.030 --> 04:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
works with people who
 
04:29:09.990 --> 04:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
are underinsured or not insured helping
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
them get on insurance but also helping
 
04:29:12.239 --> 04:29:13.670 align:start position:0%
them get on insurance but also helping
them

04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
with different sources of help for their
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
care or setting up payment plans but i
 
04:29:21.189 --> 04:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
am absolutely sure that a lot of people
 
04:29:24.070 --> 04:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
are just not getting care
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
or delaying care
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:33.510 --> 04:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
i coverage for follow-up
 
04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
so we're we're paying
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
is is it true that we're we're paying
 
04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
for this anyway or we're denying care
 
04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
which would be immoral
 
04:29:44.080 --> 04:29:47.349 align:start position:0%
which would be immoral
correct

04:29:47.349 --> 04:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:49.590 --> 04:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
yes i think that's correct i mean i
 
04:29:49.600 --> 04:29:50.870 align:start position:0%
yes i think that's correct i mean i
think

04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:29:53.429 --> 04:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
some people some providers
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
are providing unreimbursed care and for
 
04:29:58.830 --> 04:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
some of them are able to do that i think
 
04:29:58.840 --> 04:30:00.630 align:start position:0%
some of them are able to do that i think
uh

04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:30:04.070 --> 04:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
a federally qualified health center is
 
04:30:07.590 --> 04:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
maybe better able to do that
 
04:30:09.670 --> 04:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals are doing it
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:17.910 --> 04:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
and that's that's um difficult for them
 
04:30:19.269 --> 04:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
because they're under stress in a
 
04:30:21.030 --> 04:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
variety of other ways
 
04:30:21.040 --> 04:30:24.149 align:start position:0%
variety of other ways
um

04:30:24.149 --> 04:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:26.309 --> 04:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
and and certainly some people just not
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
getting care i mean you know some
 
04:30:29.760 --> 04:30:30.870 align:start position:0%
getting care i mean you know some
people

04:30:30.870 --> 04:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:30:32.710 --> 04:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
get prenatal care the whole time they're
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
pregnant and some people don't come in
 
04:30:37.030 --> 04:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
for that care until the last couple of
 
04:30:41.189 --> 04:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
months because they couldn't afford it
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:30:45.269 --> 04:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
04:30:46.710 --> 04:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:30:48.309 --> 04:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
04:30:51.189 --> 04:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
question uh do we have any data on how
 
04:30:52.630 --> 04:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
many people in new hampshire are not
 
04:30:57.670 --> 04:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
i certainly do not um and i don't know
 
04:31:03.990 --> 04:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
if um somebody is going to testify from
 
04:31:06.550 --> 04:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
health and human services and they might
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you
 
04:31:17.670 --> 04:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
so if uh
 
04:31:19.510 --> 04:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna just ask
 
04:31:21.429 --> 04:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
what i think this does and
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
so that's my question does this program
 
04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill does that mean
 
04:31:30.149 --> 04:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
simply that we are just uh
 
04:31:31.750 --> 04:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
getting rid of that five-year
 
04:31:33.990 --> 04:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
requirement to become to apply for
 
04:31:34.000 --> 04:31:39.670 align:start position:0%
requirement to become to apply for
medicaid

04:31:39.670 --> 04:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
yes that's what it means for only for
 
04:31:42.640 --> 04:31:43.750 align:start position:0%
yes that's what it means for only for
children

04:31:43.750 --> 04:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
and only for pregnant
 
04:31:46.560 --> 04:31:47.590 align:start position:0%
and only for pregnant
women

04:31:47.590 --> 04:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
women
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
and only for people on a very specific
 
04:31:51.830 --> 04:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
list which you have in front of you
 
04:31:54.309 --> 04:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
different immigration categories
 
04:31:56.550 --> 04:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
and when you say is is this simply what
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
04:32:00.469 --> 04:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
nothing is simple i've been trying to
 
04:32:02.630 --> 04:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
understand these different immigration
 
04:32:03.800 --> 04:32:03.810 align:start position:0%
categories for
 
04:32:03.810 --> 04:32:05.030 align:start position:0%
categories for

[Music]
 
04:32:07.510 --> 04:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
i first wrote this bill last year and i
 
04:32:07.520 --> 04:32:08.870 align:start position:0%
i first wrote this bill last year and i
i

04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:32:10.710 --> 04:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
have been speaking to this person in los
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
angeles who is the only person i've
 
04:32:15.110 --> 04:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
i've been able to find who seems to
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
understand some of this and um having
 
04:32:19.990 --> 04:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
spoken to her many times i don't fully
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
04:32:21.680 --> 04:32:22.710 align:start position:0%
understand it
so

04:32:22.710 --> 04:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
everything about immigration law is very
 
04:32:25.279 --> 04:32:26.630 align:start position:0%
everything about immigration law is very
complicated

04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
04:32:26.640 --> 04:32:27.670 align:start position:0%
complicated
but

04:32:27.670 --> 04:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
you should know that it's only specific
 
04:32:32.790 --> 04:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
categories of people who this will apply
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
to for example
 
04:32:37.269 --> 04:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
in keene we have a program called
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
project home
 
04:32:40.950 --> 04:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
and they have taken in
 
04:32:43.110 --> 04:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
families and individuals
 
04:32:45.189 --> 04:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
who are in the process of applying for
 
04:32:45.199 --> 04:32:47.349 align:start position:0%
who are in the process of applying for
asylum

04:32:47.349 --> 04:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
asylum
 
04:32:50.070 --> 04:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
so they are not citizens
 
04:32:52.229 --> 04:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
um they are not undocumented they are
 
04:32:54.870 --> 04:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
people who've made an application
 
04:32:58.149 --> 04:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
um based on the fact that they have been
 
04:33:00.630 --> 04:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
persecuted in their home country maybe
 
04:33:02.710 --> 04:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
they've been tortured maybe they've been
 
04:33:02.720 --> 04:33:04.789 align:start position:0%
they've been tortured maybe they've been
threatened

04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
threatened
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
and they are making a case with the
 
04:33:08.869 --> 04:33:08.879 align:start position:0%
united states government that they can't
 
04:33:10.709 --> 04:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
go back to their country and that they
 
04:33:12.869 --> 04:33:12.879 align:start position:0%
should have asylum here it's a long
 
04:33:12.879 --> 04:33:15.189 align:start position:0%
should have asylum here it's a long
process

04:33:15.189 --> 04:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:33:17.189 --> 04:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
it can be two years
 
04:33:20.230 --> 04:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
three years before you get your final
 
04:33:20.240 --> 04:33:21.269 align:start position:0%
three years before you get your final
um

04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:23.830 --> 04:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
hearing to make for the for them to make
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
that determination
 
04:33:30.150 --> 04:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:33.189 --> 04:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
children who have applied for asylum
 
04:33:34.869 --> 04:33:34.879 align:start position:0%
will be
 
04:33:36.869 --> 04:33:36.879 align:start position:0%
the five-year wait will be
 
04:33:40.510 --> 04:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
waived after 180 days of them
 
04:33:40.520 --> 04:33:42.390 align:start position:0%
waived after 180 days of them
post-application

04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
post-application
 
04:33:44.629 --> 04:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
and for adults
 
04:33:48.470 --> 04:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
um the five-year wait will be waived
 
04:33:50.470 --> 04:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
after they get their work permit which
 
04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:54.000 --> 04:33:55.429 align:start position:0%
 
halfway

04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
halfway
 
04:33:57.510 --> 04:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
part of the process
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
so nothing is simple it's all very
 
04:34:00.240 --> 04:34:01.120 align:start position:0%

04:34:04.390 --> 04:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
but basically yes we'll be waiving a
 
04:34:06.551 --> 04:34:06.561 align:start position:0%
five-year wait so that people can become
 
04:34:06.561 --> 04:34:08.949 align:start position:0%
five-year wait so that people can become
insured

04:34:08.949 --> 04:34:08.959 align:start position:0%
insured
 
04:34:12.150 --> 04:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
and get health care
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
recognize for a follow-up
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
thank you uh the map the second page
 
04:34:18.390 --> 04:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
that you gave us
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh does make a difference between the
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
states that are dark and the states that
 
04:34:23.990 --> 04:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
are lightly colored
 
04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh right now we don't have any color so
 
04:34:29.109 --> 04:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
we're trying to add that i assume
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh so i'll just specify that as of
 
04:34:33.429 --> 04:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
january 2020
 
04:34:35.510 --> 04:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
you would mention medical coverage for
 
04:34:37.830 --> 04:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
children regardless of immigration
 
04:34:37.840 --> 04:34:38.830 align:start position:0%
children regardless of immigration
status

04:34:38.830 --> 04:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
status
 
04:34:41.670 --> 04:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
was california
 
04:34:44.629 --> 04:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
maybe that's has that changed
 
04:34:44.639 --> 04:34:46.230 align:start position:0%
maybe that's has that changed
uh

04:34:46.230 --> 04:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:34:48.390 --> 04:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
i don't i i don't believe i mentioned
 
04:34:50.230 --> 04:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
that however
 
04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
now that you bring it up
 
04:34:52.080 --> 04:34:52.869 align:start position:0%
now that you bring it up
um

04:34:52.869 --> 04:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
the bill that i'm passing is a very
 
04:35:01.750 --> 04:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
small bill for a very small number of
 
04:35:01.760 --> 04:35:03.830 align:start position:0%
small bill for a very small number of
people

04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
it does not cover anybody
 
04:35:08.869 --> 04:35:08.879 align:start position:0%
for whom there's not a federal match
 
04:35:11.590 --> 04:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
it only applies to people who are
 
04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
the term that they use is lawfully
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
residing however that being said
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
some some states around the
 
04:35:19.439 --> 04:35:21.109 align:start position:0%
some some states around the
country

04:35:21.109 --> 04:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
country
 
04:35:21.119 --> 04:35:22.629 align:start position:0%
country
have

04:35:22.629 --> 04:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:35:22.639 --> 04:35:23.910 align:start position:0%
have
taken

04:35:23.910 --> 04:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
taken
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
past bills that would allow
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
coverage for
 
04:35:28.320 --> 04:35:29.590 align:start position:0%
coverage for
immigrants

04:35:29.590 --> 04:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
04:35:32.949 --> 04:35:32.959 align:start position:0%
regardless of their immigration status
 
04:35:35.029 --> 04:35:35.039 align:start position:0%
so it is true that in some other states
 
04:35:37.029 --> 04:35:37.039 align:start position:0%
like california new york oregon
 
04:35:37.039 --> 04:35:39.269 align:start position:0%
like california new york oregon
washington

04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
washington
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
they use state funds to provide health
 
04:35:45.990 --> 04:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
care coverage for people regardless of
 
04:35:47.910 --> 04:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
their immigration status that is not
 
04:35:53.429 --> 04:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
04:35:58.551 --> 04:35:58.561 align:start position:0%

which representative

manner of supports for immigrants
 
04:38:36.150 --> 04:38:36.160 align:start position:0%

trying to make a home here in the united
states

04:38:39.269 --> 04:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
more often than not we are supporting
 
04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
people who are coming out of immigrant
 
04:38:46.470 --> 04:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
detention such as sandra nakentre's
 
04:38:46.480 --> 04:38:48.869 align:start position:0%
detention such as sandra nakentre's
husband

04:38:48.869 --> 04:38:48.879 align:start position:0%
husband
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
as was referenced in that letter
 
04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
so people for whom their immigration
 
04:38:52.959 --> 04:38:54.150 align:start position:0%
so people for whom their immigration
attorneys

04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
04:38:56.949 --> 04:38:56.959 align:start position:0%
have found a pathway for them to
 
04:38:56.959 --> 04:38:57.750 align:start position:0%
have found a pathway for them to
to

04:38:57.750 --> 04:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:39:00.150 --> 04:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
begin what could be a long and very
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
expensive process to to finding some
 
04:39:04.470 --> 04:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
relief here
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
and many of the people supported in
 
04:39:08.869 --> 04:39:08.879 align:start position:0%
these networks are asylum seekers at
 
04:39:11.189 --> 04:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
various stages of the process
 
04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
so these are volunteers from churches
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
from community groups they're
 
04:39:16.551 --> 04:39:16.561 align:start position:0%
individuals who are just
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
finding in these chaotic times like a
 
04:39:20.949 --> 04:39:20.959 align:start position:0%
concrete and loving way to be a
 
04:39:22.789 --> 04:39:22.799 align:start position:0%
welcoming community and it's quite
 
04:39:22.799 --> 04:39:24.470 align:start position:0%
welcoming community and it's quite
inspiring

04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
inspiring
 
04:39:26.470 --> 04:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
and what and it's the work is about
 
04:39:28.310 --> 04:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
relationship building and it's about
 
04:39:31.269 --> 04:39:31.279 align:start position:0%
learning about the complexity of this
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
immigration system that needs to be
 
04:39:35.590 --> 04:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
brought into greater coherence
 
04:39:38.708 --> 04:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
and also it's a lesson about
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
what's needed in terms of our safety net
 
04:39:41.440 --> 04:39:42.470 align:start position:0%
what's needed in terms of our safety net
for

04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
all people in our in our country and in
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
our state but perhaps in a particular
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
way people who don't yet have a
 
04:39:53.670 --> 04:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
um an immigration status of citizenship
 
04:39:56.070 --> 04:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
or legal permanent res well or legal
 
04:39:58.230 --> 04:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
permanent residency
 
04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
so your constituents are active in these
 
04:40:02.470 --> 04:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
networks it's why i noticed that the
 
04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
sign-ins in support of this bill are
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
quite strong for something that's quite
 
04:40:08.310 --> 04:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
technical and narrow because they have
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
realized what a benefit this would be
 
04:40:12.390 --> 04:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
for those
 
04:40:15.030 --> 04:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
who would be eligible and certainly the
 
04:40:16.868 --> 04:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
pool of people we're serving in our
 
04:40:19.830 --> 04:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
immigrant uh support networks is broader
 
04:40:21.510 --> 04:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
than the community of people who will be
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
assisted by this bill but it because of
 
04:40:25.990 --> 04:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
our experience we have seen
 
04:40:27.910 --> 04:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
how important this is and what what a
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
positive step it is for our community so
 
04:40:33.750 --> 04:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's all i wanted to to lift up today
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%

taking my question uh is there some
 
04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
place that there's like a list of all of
 
04:41:09.270 --> 04:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
these organizations that volunteer to
 
04:41:10.628 --> 04:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
help immigrants
 
04:41:13.350 --> 04:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
so i will be delighted to kind of brag
 
04:41:14.948 --> 04:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
on that network and send it to you
 
04:41:17.670 --> 04:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes the work is so kind of organic
 
04:41:19.430 --> 04:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
and grassroots that not a lot of
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
attention has gone into
 
04:41:23.510 --> 04:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
creating a website presence for the
 
04:41:25.750 --> 04:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
network as a whole
 
04:41:27.190 --> 04:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
i imagine some of the individual
 
04:41:28.788 --> 04:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
programs do have websites so i'll link
 
04:41:33.350 --> 04:41:33.360 align:start position:0%

now asylum seekers i i sort of have a
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
general idea of what an asylum seeker is
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
but as an asylum seeker someone who is
 
04:44:31.830 --> 04:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
legally here
 
04:44:34.470 --> 04:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
yes an asylum seeker
 
04:44:36.628 --> 04:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
has as soon as they
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
um come to the states or within a year
 
04:44:42.070 --> 04:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
they must ask for asylum and they have
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
to they're interviewed by ice and they
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
must prove a credible fear
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
that if they go home they will be
 
04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
tortured or killed
 
04:44:50.638 --> 04:44:51.590 align:start position:0%
tortured or killed
or

04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:44:55.110 --> 04:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
abused in some way and they are given if
 
04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
they pass that test they're given an
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
asylum number
 
04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's their only id
 
04:45:04.230 --> 04:45:04.240 align:start position:0%

04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
i was born in new hampshire
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
and have taught english as a second
 
04:46:18.628 --> 04:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
language in many area schools
 
04:46:21.990 --> 04:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
durham rochester dover
 
04:46:25.350 --> 04:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
the civil rights act of 1964 says that
 
04:46:27.750 --> 04:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
children cannot be deprived of their
 
04:46:31.350 --> 04:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
education due to national origin
 
04:46:31.360 --> 04:46:32.230 align:start position:0%
education due to national origin
so

04:46:32.230 --> 04:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:34.708 --> 04:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
we help immigrant as well as native born
 
04:46:34.718 --> 04:46:35.910 align:start position:0%
we help immigrant as well as native born
americans

04:46:35.910 --> 04:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
americans
 
04:46:39.190 --> 04:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
to learn english and understand their
 
04:46:39.200 --> 04:46:40.868 align:start position:0%
to learn english and understand their
lessons

04:46:40.868 --> 04:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
lessons
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
it is well demonstrated by research that
 
04:46:45.670 --> 04:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
children learn better
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
when they are healthy
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
i have hosted
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
many people but i've hosted a family
 
04:46:54.550 --> 04:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
seeking asylum for about a year and a
 
04:46:54.560 --> 04:46:55.590 align:start position:0%
seeking asylum for about a year and a
half

04:46:55.590 --> 04:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
half
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
and witnessed first-hand the difficulty
 
04:47:00.788 --> 04:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
regarding health care
 
04:47:03.270 --> 04:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
children need immunizations
 
04:47:05.830 --> 04:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
and physical examinations in order to
 
04:47:07.830 --> 04:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
attend school
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
these cost money
 
04:47:12.070 --> 04:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
asylum seekers
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
have to wait six months before they can
 
04:47:16.628 --> 04:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
get a work permit or earn any money
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
and then a long time before
 
04:47:22.550 --> 04:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
other kinds of help can come
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
we as a group
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
probably close to 20 people
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
had to scrounge together
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
rides friends friends of friends
 
04:47:34.390 --> 04:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
and search
 
04:47:36.868 --> 04:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
to find affordable services
 
04:47:42.150 --> 04:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:46.150 --> 04:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
as we have noted lately in this epidemic
 
04:47:46.160 --> 04:47:48.310 align:start position:0%
as we have noted lately in this epidemic
immunizations

04:47:48.310 --> 04:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
04:47:51.350 --> 04:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
keep help keep everyone safe not only
 
04:47:53.830 --> 04:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
research also demonstrates that early
 
04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
health care and intervention saves more
 
04:48:01.110 --> 04:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
difficulties and ultimately money later
 
04:48:01.120 --> 04:48:02.868 align:start position:0%
difficulties and ultimately money later
on

04:48:02.868 --> 04:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
during my teaching career
 
04:48:07.830 --> 04:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
i witnessed many children go without
 
04:48:09.910 --> 04:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
health care they needed
 
04:48:12.628 --> 04:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
they often miss school and sometimes
 
04:48:14.470 --> 04:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't come to school because they did
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
not meet the medical requirements
 
04:48:21.830 --> 04:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
so i support hb1578
 
04:48:24.868 --> 04:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
to extend medical coverage eligibility
 
04:48:28.628 --> 04:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
eligibility which has helped
 
04:48:31.270 --> 04:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
to pay for by the federal government
 
04:48:33.910 --> 04:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
to cover these vulnerable pregnant women
 
04:48:36.550 --> 04:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
and children
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
i support it because we as civilized
 
04:48:39.600 --> 04:48:40.788 align:start position:0%
i support it because we as civilized
people

04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
need to care for our children
 
04:48:46.948 --> 04:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
if compassion is not enough
 
04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
then realize it is economically
 
04:48:49.360 --> 04:48:50.708 align:start position:0%
then realize it is economically
practical

04:48:50.708 --> 04:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
practical
 
04:48:52.830 --> 04:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
as health care provided in a timely
 
04:48:56.708 --> 04:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
manner saves money later on
 
04:48:58.470 --> 04:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
many of these children will become
 
04:48:58.480 --> 04:49:00.550 align:start position:0%
many of these children will become
citizens

04:49:00.550 --> 04:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
04:49:03.190 --> 04:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
do we want to raise underdeveloped and
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
undereducated people

even for us that practice every day it
 
04:52:13.830 --> 04:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
is chaotic immigration laws change every
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
day and that's why you see a big push
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
for uh immigration reform in the country
 
04:52:23.350 --> 04:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
is because our laws have been so archaic
 
04:52:25.990 --> 04:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
that uh it doesn't really
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%

so these individuals uh you know they're
usually

04:52:50.070 --> 04:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
usually
 
04:52:53.110 --> 04:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
they have some sort of permission from
 
04:52:53.120 --> 04:52:54.310 align:start position:0%
they have some sort of permission from
um

04:52:54.310 --> 04:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:56.550 --> 04:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
the government to stay here
 
04:52:59.830 --> 04:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh lawfully so there is a difference you
 
04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
know between uh lawful presence and
 
04:53:05.350 --> 04:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
authorized presence um you know
 
04:53:08.550 --> 04:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know they they may overlap
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
but in these cases someone that applies
 
04:53:13.670 --> 04:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
for asylum fur for example
 
04:53:16.070 --> 04:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh someone was being generous before me
 
04:53:19.110 --> 04:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
they said three years so asylum can
 
04:53:21.910 --> 04:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
actually take uh 20 years uh so the
 
04:53:25.270 --> 04:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
average is between 10 to 15 years for
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
someone to to get asylum so the laws uh
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
you know like have changed uh in the
 
04:53:33.270 --> 04:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
past two years as to
 
04:53:35.030 --> 04:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know someone
 
04:53:37.350 --> 04:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
that is able to get a work authorization
 
04:53:39.750 --> 04:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
when they plot they apply for asylum
 
04:53:42.550 --> 04:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
before i used to have
 
04:53:46.868 --> 04:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
to wait 150 days and uh and apply you
 
04:53:49.990 --> 04:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
know to apply for work authorization um
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
the total was actually 180 days because
 
04:53:53.430 --> 04:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
you had to
 
04:53:56.230 --> 04:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
wait another uh an additional 30 days so
 
04:53:59.430 --> 04:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
we actually say 180 days um so but it
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
has been changed to 365 days now uh
 
04:54:06.150 --> 04:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
until someone that in like a
 
04:54:08.948 --> 04:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
files for an asylum application and you
 
04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
know uh tries to get a work
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
authorization that enables them to you
 
04:54:15.750 --> 04:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
know get a social security uh and like a
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
driver's license um so this bill clearly
 
04:54:21.510 --> 04:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
would you know like enable these folks
 
04:54:25.350 --> 04:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh you like not to wait 15 20 years you
 
04:54:27.430 --> 04:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
know to to be able to
 
04:54:29.830 --> 04:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know like apply for uh you know like
 
04:54:32.708 --> 04:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
a benefit for for their children i work
 
04:54:34.150 --> 04:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
with a lot of folks from from
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and in massachusetts you
 
04:54:39.270 --> 04:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
have you know the mass health um and
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
some of these you know families that do
 
04:54:41.600 --> 04:54:42.390 align:start position:0%
some of these you know families that do
have

04:54:42.390 --> 04:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:54:44.550 --> 04:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
um you know they're mixed families you
 
04:54:46.868 --> 04:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
know the parents are typically
 
04:54:46.878 --> 04:54:48.310 align:start position:0%
know the parents are typically
um

04:54:48.310 --> 04:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
we we say undocumented not illegal
 
04:54:54.628 --> 04:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
and the children are
 
04:54:57.110 --> 04:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
us citizens or sometimes they're
 
04:54:57.120 --> 04:54:58.390 align:start position:0%
us citizens or sometimes they're
non-citizens

04:54:58.390 --> 04:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
non-citizens
 
04:54:59.990 --> 04:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know these children you know
 
04:55:01.910 --> 04:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're still able to to get some some
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
coverage uh through you know through
 
04:55:06.788 --> 04:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
mass health clearly that's not where you
 
04:55:09.350 --> 04:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
know representative shapiro is trying to
 
04:55:13.110 --> 04:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
do uh this this would you know limit the
 
04:55:15.030 --> 04:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the amount of individuals
 
04:55:16.628 --> 04:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
who would qualify
 
04:55:19.270 --> 04:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
um so i'm going to stop here and thank
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
you for your time i'm open to any
 
04:55:24.150 --> 04:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
questions but i know you're not rushed
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
04:55:27.430 --> 04:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
04:55:29.590 --> 04:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you uh for
 
04:55:32.230 --> 04:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you just clarify
 
04:55:34.150 --> 04:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
the the process
 
04:55:35.590 --> 04:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
like where
 
04:55:35.600 --> 04:55:37.190 align:start position:0%
like where
where

04:55:37.190 --> 04:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:55:38.550 --> 04:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
at what point can someone apply for
 
04:55:41.590 --> 04:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
asylum at what point can they get a work
 
04:55:41.600 --> 04:55:42.788 align:start position:0%
asylum at what point can they get a work
permit

04:55:42.788 --> 04:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
permit
 
04:55:42.798 --> 04:55:43.990 align:start position:0%
permit
and

04:55:43.990 --> 04:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
like how does that interface so for
 
04:55:48.628 --> 04:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
asylum uh typically you know like it
 
04:55:50.788 --> 04:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
works um
 
04:55:52.470 --> 04:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
there are different like i like to say
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
there are different steps to it so
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
pretty much you have to claim to to the
 
04:56:00.070 --> 04:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
government that uh you were unable to
 
04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
return to your home country uh because
 
04:56:05.110 --> 04:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
of the fear in lack of a you know
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
persecution um you know for race
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
nationality political opinion uh and
 
04:56:12.628 --> 04:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
like and so forth
 
04:56:12.638 --> 04:56:13.670 align:start position:0%
like and so forth
um

04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
and uh as someone mentioned you know
 
04:56:18.390 --> 04:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
there is a credible fear that the person
 
04:56:21.430 --> 04:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
has to um you know has to to meet the
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
burden uh you know like in order to uh
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
especially when they are in detention in
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
order to move forward um
 
04:56:30.708 --> 04:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
with you know the application so there
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
is a credible fear application
 
04:56:35.430 --> 04:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh so the person then submits the
 
04:56:35.440 --> 04:56:36.628 align:start position:0%
uh so the person then submits the
application

04:56:36.628 --> 04:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
application
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
04:56:39.830 --> 04:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh the the court
 
04:56:39.840 --> 04:56:40.868 align:start position:0%
uh the the court
um

04:56:40.868 --> 04:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
and after the application has been
 
04:56:45.990 --> 04:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh submitted
 
04:56:49.590 --> 04:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
um you know the person after uh there we
 
04:56:52.470 --> 04:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
call it clock
 
04:56:54.628 --> 04:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
so after you know the clock starts
 
04:56:54.638 --> 04:56:55.670 align:start position:0%
so after you know the clock starts
running

04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
running
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
so the law right now says that the
 
04:56:59.948 --> 04:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
person has to wait
 
04:57:02.470 --> 04:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
365 days to apply
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh for work authorization so that's you
 
04:57:07.990 --> 04:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
know that only gives them the ability um
 
04:57:10.150 --> 04:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know to you know to get a driver's
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
license and then social security it
 
04:57:13.990 --> 04:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't give them you know the ability
 
04:57:16.948 --> 04:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
to seek out any uh you know like
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
benefits that typically you know like
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
lawful permanent residents and u.s
 
04:57:24.150 --> 04:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
citizens are entitled
 
04:57:29.110 --> 04:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
so it can be you know 10 15 20 years
 
04:57:31.110 --> 04:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome are
 
04:57:33.190 --> 04:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
there other questions from the committee
 
04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:41.830 --> 04:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'll take off my scooper time
 
04:57:43.190 --> 04:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
can you help me understand something as
 
04:57:46.628 --> 04:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
far as an immigrant who's here in the us
 
04:57:48.868 --> 04:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
during the five years with awaiting
 
04:57:51.590 --> 04:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
the mother at this point in time
 
04:57:53.350 --> 04:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
are they required to pay social security
 
04:57:55.190 --> 04:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
tax or income tax so therefore to
 
04:57:56.470 --> 04:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
putting into the system and not really
 
04:57:58.150 --> 04:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
get anything back out of it
 
04:58:00.628 --> 04:58:00.638 align:start position:0%
no absolutely as a matter of fact uh you
 
04:58:02.788 --> 04:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
know there is a big misconception
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
that you know like undocumented uh
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
people don't pay taxes uh as a matter of
 
04:58:09.910 --> 04:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
fact you know like they they do
 
04:58:11.990 --> 04:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh in new hampshire alone uh you know
 
04:58:14.628 --> 04:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
like uh there is a data i'll be happy to
 
04:58:18.470 --> 04:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
share with you in uh 2019 which is the
 
04:58:20.430 --> 04:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
last data that that we have
 
04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
undocumented folks
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
paid almost 80 million dollars just in
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
taxes and these are money that you know
 
04:58:30.310 --> 04:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
they cannot you know uh claim back
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
so that's what they paid in taxes alone
 
04:58:36.070 --> 04:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
just undocumented people we estimate
 
04:58:38.470 --> 04:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
that we have about 15 000 documented
 
04:58:41.430 --> 04:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
folks here uh but again you know these
 
04:58:43.030 --> 04:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
folks are not really considered
 
04:58:45.030 --> 04:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
documented they're considered you know
 
04:58:47.830 --> 04:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
lawfully and um you know i can pretty
 
04:58:47.840 --> 04:58:48.708 align:start position:0%
lawfully and um you know i can pretty
much

04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:58:51.750 --> 04:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh all immigrants we have um you know
 
04:58:54.708 --> 04:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
about a hundred thousand uh you know
 
04:58:57.430 --> 04:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
immigrants in the state which um you
 
04:58:59.750 --> 04:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
know these immigrants including myself
 
04:59:02.230 --> 04:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
we paid almost a billion dollars in
 
04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
taxes in 2019. so yeah so we do pay
 
04:59:06.240 --> 04:59:08.628 align:start position:0%
taxes in 2019. so yeah so we do pay
taxes

04:59:08.628 --> 04:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:59:11.510 --> 04:59:11.520 align:start position:0%

i'm relatively
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
good friends with
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
some people who are from mexico
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
and they own restaurant and one of the
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
workers comes and stays for six months
 
04:59:30.708 --> 04:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
and then goes back home
 
04:59:33.270 --> 04:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i know he can work legally and he's
 
04:59:35.910 --> 04:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
here i i imagine on a green card i'm not
 
04:59:38.470 --> 04:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
quite sure how well i don't know i'm not
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
quite sure how that works and if
 
04:59:44.070 --> 04:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:44.080 --> 04:59:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
undocumented

04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
undocumented
 
04:59:48.390 --> 04:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
how can they get a job because you have
 
04:59:51.910 --> 04:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
to fill out ein aya 9s
 
04:59:56.150 --> 04:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh so in in this case he
 
04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh he likely i cannot say for certain
 
05:00:02.070 --> 05:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
but he likely uh you know like has a
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
temporary visa which pretty much that's
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
the folks that you know like when you go
 
05:00:09.670 --> 05:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
to canopy lake uh you know these uh in
 
05:00:12.150 --> 05:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
like parks that's what they usually have
 
05:00:14.470 --> 05:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
so it only authorizes them to to stay
 
05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
here for a certain amount of time and
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
upon the determination of that time
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
period uh they ought to return to their
 
05:00:25.990 --> 05:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
home country uh in regards to to working
 
05:00:29.590 --> 05:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh in like um unauthorized uh what
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
happens uh constantly
 
05:00:35.270 --> 05:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
is uh you know uh the majority of uh you
 
05:00:36.070 --> 05:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
know like
 
05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
immigrants in uh in the state and you
 
05:00:41.110 --> 05:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
know like in other states as well uh you
 
05:00:44.230 --> 05:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
know like they the men typically work
 
05:00:46.830 --> 05:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know doing construction
 
05:00:50.070 --> 05:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
landscaping you know like snow shoveling
 
05:00:52.310 --> 05:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh women typically uh you know like
 
05:00:54.390 --> 05:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
house cleaning
 
05:00:56.788 --> 05:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
so pretty much these individuals they
 
05:00:56.798 --> 05:00:57.910 align:start position:0%
so pretty much these individuals they
create

05:00:57.910 --> 05:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
create
 
05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know their own company including
 
05:01:01.350 --> 05:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire you don't need to be a
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
u.s citizen
 
05:01:05.670 --> 05:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
to start your own company they open
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
their own business and they subcontract
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
it out
 
05:01:10.798 --> 05:01:11.750 align:start position:0%
it out
so

05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:01:13.590 --> 05:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
pretty much you know they get a big
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
contractor the contractor
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
hires them and they perform the job and
 
05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's how they file the taxes
 
05:01:25.030 --> 05:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
and yeah the other option is the
 
05:01:29.510 --> 05:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh the itin itin number i think number
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:35.030 --> 05:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:01:36.788 --> 05:01:36.798 align:start position:0%

05:01:38.550 --> 05:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
immigration attorney here with us so

05:01:41.430 --> 05:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
we had heard the term immigrant
 
05:01:43.350 --> 05:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
detention a few times earlier and i was
 
05:01:44.948 --> 05:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
just hoping you could just help us
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what that is
 
05:01:51.510 --> 05:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
um so immediate detention so
 
05:01:51.520 --> 05:01:52.550 align:start position:0%
um so immediate detention so
um

05:01:52.550 --> 05:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:55.830 --> 05:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so unfortunately um
 
05:01:58.550 --> 05:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
in the past couple of years we
 
05:01:58.560 --> 05:01:59.750 align:start position:0%
in the past couple of years we
um

05:01:59.750 --> 05:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of immigrants you know like
 
05:02:04.150 --> 05:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
being detained uh you know simply for
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
being here uh unlawfully uh prior to
 
05:02:10.310 --> 05:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
that um you know like anyone that would
 
05:02:14.070 --> 05:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
come to this country um could
 
05:02:16.230 --> 05:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
i stay here without you know the
 
05:02:18.470 --> 05:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
government uh you know like bothering
 
05:02:21.350 --> 05:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
them or you know coming in contact them
 
05:02:23.430 --> 05:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
um i should say
 
05:02:25.750 --> 05:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
if uh you know they haven't uh you know
 
05:02:27.430 --> 05:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
committed any crime
 
05:02:28.868 --> 05:02:28.878 align:start position:0%
if they
 
05:02:31.670 --> 05:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh had showed up to all of
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
the you know their immigration court
 
05:02:35.910 --> 05:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh there what we call it in like a
 
05:02:38.230 --> 05:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
priority uh categories
 
05:02:38.240 --> 05:02:39.510 align:start position:0%
priority uh categories
um

05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately uh that had changed
 
05:02:46.390 --> 05:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
that you know like anybody at any time
 
05:02:49.750 --> 05:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh anywhere could be uh placed uh could
 
05:02:55.190 --> 05:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
be detained uh simply for being here um
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
undocumented so that created in like a
 
05:03:01.030 --> 05:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
chaos in our communities because
 
05:03:02.948 --> 05:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know like a lot of you know these
 
05:03:02.958 --> 05:03:03.990 align:start position:0%
uh you know like a lot of you know these
children

05:03:03.990 --> 05:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:03:04.000 --> 05:03:05.030 align:start position:0%
children
um

05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:07.830 --> 05:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
especially children um you know like
 
05:03:11.110 --> 05:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
we're having you know the father who
 
05:03:13.510 --> 05:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
would be you know like undocumented and
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
placed in removal proceedings and this
 
05:03:18.868 --> 05:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
father you know typically um you know
 
05:03:21.590 --> 05:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
like would be the the bread winner of uh
 
05:03:24.390 --> 05:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
you know the family and the in some
 
05:03:26.948 --> 05:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
cases you know the the wife would be a
 
05:03:29.590 --> 05:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
u.s citizen uh you know the children
 
05:03:31.830 --> 05:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
would be us citizen and only the father
 
05:03:34.230 --> 05:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
would be undocumented and that you know
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
created a chaos uh
 
05:03:38.550 --> 05:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
because you know like now you know the
 
05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
the mother would have to find means you
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
know to you know um you know to to pay
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know for you know the day-to-day you
 
05:03:49.030 --> 05:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
know uh costs
 
05:03:51.030 --> 05:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh in lack of living
 
05:03:52.948 --> 05:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
and you know and pretty much there was
 
05:03:55.270 --> 05:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know like a mass uh
 
05:03:57.430 --> 05:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
a mass detention uh you know
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately without any priority
 
05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and then the other question is
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
it seems like people are living for a
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
year or longer without being able to
 
05:04:08.070 --> 05:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
have certain support do we have a very
 
05:04:09.990 --> 05:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
strong charity network here in the state
 
05:04:11.830 --> 05:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's helping these people
 
05:04:13.590 --> 05:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
start off their life here
 
05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily
 
05:04:19.830 --> 05:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately no uh so these individuals
 
05:04:22.310 --> 05:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know they they come here
 
05:04:24.310 --> 05:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh and the majority of them especially
 
05:04:27.590 --> 05:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
undocumented uh they are in the grace of
 
05:04:29.270 --> 05:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know the folks that have been here
 
05:04:31.910 --> 05:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
before them you know to to help uh you
 
05:04:34.550 --> 05:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
know like navigate uh you know like the
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
system and you know pretty much in like
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
99 of uh you know the the people that
 
05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
come to me is because someone you know
 
05:04:44.830 --> 05:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
directed them to me
 
05:04:47.830 --> 05:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
um so you know usually you know that's
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
how it works you know um as
 
05:04:53.430 --> 05:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
it was there was a question before
 
05:04:56.948 --> 05:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:58.628 --> 05:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
regarding you know the clinics how they
 
05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
provide support so yeah so some of these
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
clinics you know unfortunately
 
05:05:04.948 --> 05:05:04.958 align:start position:0%

bill
 
05:06:25.430 --> 05:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
data shows that on average immigrant
 
05:06:26.948 --> 05:06:26.958 align:start position:0%
families are often disproportionately
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
lower income and have higher rates of
 
05:06:31.110 --> 05:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
uninsurance or under insurance
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire only 55 percent of

migration policy center
 
05:06:42.390 --> 05:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
the rest are left to depend on
 
05:06:44.788 --> 05:06:44.798 align:start position:0%
employer-based coverage public exchanges
 
05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
or other high-cost options or in many

entirely
 
05:06:51.350 --> 05:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
of course we know that health coverage
 
05:06:54.628 --> 05:06:54.638 align:start position:0%
is a key contributor to access to access
 
05:06:56.070 --> 05:06:56.080 align:start position:0%

05:06:58.708 --> 05:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
further health insurance is critical to
 
05:07:00.550 --> 05:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
overall financial health and stability
 
05:07:02.390 --> 05:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
without it children especially are more
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
likely to experience poverty or other
 
05:07:06.550 --> 05:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences which can
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
impair brain development and lead to
 
05:07:09.270 --> 05:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
negative effects throughout their
 
05:07:09.280 --> 05:07:10.310 align:start position:0%
negative effects throughout their
lifetime

05:07:10.310 --> 05:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
lifetime
 
05:07:12.788 --> 05:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
by allowing legally residing immigration
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
immigrant children and families to more
 
05:07:17.270 --> 05:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
immediately access medicaid and chip
 
05:07:18.788 --> 05:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
this bill would help to provide better
 
05:07:20.470 --> 05:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
health and stability to this important
 
05:07:22.788 --> 05:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
part of our population it would decrease
 
05:07:24.310 --> 05:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
long-term costs facing the health care
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
system and it would help to improve the
 
05:07:27.910 --> 05:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
health and wellness of our state overall
 
05:07:29.670 --> 05:07:29.680 align:start position:0%

started doing research
 
05:12:38.080 --> 05:12:42.470 align:start position:0%
started doing research
um

05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:45.110 --> 05:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
as i said as one gets older uh

um

05:12:48.310 --> 05:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:52.390 --> 05:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
and uh this affects individuals
 
05:12:52.400 --> 05:12:53.190 align:start position:0%
and uh this affects individuals
uh

05:12:53.190 --> 05:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh

other complications
 
05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:52.878 align:start position:0%

05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
let's see um
 
05:15:17.520 --> 05:15:18.310 align:start position:0%
let's see um
well

05:15:18.310 --> 05:15:18.320 align:start position:0%

that that this condition if you decide
 
05:15:28.550 --> 05:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
that if the legislature decides that it
 
05:15:32.708 --> 05:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
does in fact as i believe it does
 
05:15:34.788 --> 05:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
meet uh meet the
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
the requirements in the current
 
05:15:40.310 --> 05:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that it's clearer to them
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
that whether they can uh they can uh
 
05:15:47.270 --> 05:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
apply for services
 
05:15:49.510 --> 05:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i i will say just for just for a
 
05:15:52.628 --> 05:15:52.638 align:start position:0%
quick interlude uh the family that i
 
05:15:55.350 --> 05:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
that i'm representing here
 
05:15:57.830 --> 05:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
has dealt with this for over 40 years in
 
05:15:59.110 --> 05:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
their family
 
05:16:00.310 --> 05:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
and they're
 
05:16:00.320 --> 05:16:01.670 align:start position:0%
and they're
unclear

05:16:01.670 --> 05:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
unclear
 
05:16:04.310 --> 05:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh as to whether they will
 
05:16:07.350 --> 05:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
they would uh be eligible because
 
05:16:09.190 --> 05:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
they've gotten different
 
05:16:09.200 --> 05:16:09.910 align:start position:0%
they've gotten different
uh

05:16:09.910 --> 05:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:16:13.430 --> 05:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh and opposite uh uh
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
answers to their questions when they've
 
05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
when they've asked that and i have also
 
05:16:19.110 --> 05:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
talked to a number
 
05:16:23.750 --> 05:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
of of people uh who operate in the field
 
05:16:25.910 --> 05:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
and they don't all give the same answer
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
they're not clear this is a rare
 
05:16:28.080 --> 05:16:29.350 align:start position:0%
they're not clear this is a rare
condition

05:16:29.350 --> 05:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
condition
 
05:16:29.360 --> 05:16:31.990 align:start position:0%
condition
and

05:16:31.990 --> 05:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:32.000 --> 05:16:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
therefore

05:16:34.390 --> 05:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
it may be the first time that it has
 
05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
come up before
 
05:16:40.708 --> 05:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
05:16:40.718 --> 05:16:42.150 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
services

05:16:42.150 --> 05:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:16:44.628 --> 05:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure of that but i i would not
 
05:16:47.910 --> 05:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
be i would not be surprised
 
05:16:50.470 --> 05:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
if we look actually if we look on the
 
05:16:51.910 --> 05:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
05:16:57.430 --> 05:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
the existing language and you'll see and
 
05:17:00.550 --> 05:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
this is in the definitions
 
05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
section of the bill
 
05:17:03.600 --> 05:17:04.868 align:start position:0%
section of the bill
which

05:17:04.868 --> 05:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:17:08.788 --> 05:17:08.798 align:start position:0%
which defines developmental disability
 
05:17:10.788 --> 05:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
yeah again if you don't mind i'll just
 
05:17:12.550 --> 05:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
read it um
 
05:17:15.430 --> 05:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
our developmental disability means a
 
05:17:18.990 --> 05:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
disability a which is attribute
 
05:17:21.910 --> 05:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
attributable to an intellectual
 
05:17:24.550 --> 05:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
disability which is the first thing
 
05:17:26.550 --> 05:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
given and in this case
 
05:17:28.470 --> 05:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
is not applicable
 
05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
because the individuals i'm talking
 
05:17:30.718 --> 05:17:31.670 align:start position:0%
because the individuals i'm talking
about

05:17:31.670 --> 05:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:17:34.628 --> 05:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
don't ha they they're both sons or
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
college graduates they were able to work
 
05:17:39.670 --> 05:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
growing up and so forth but they're now
 
05:17:41.590 --> 05:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
they're now
 
05:17:44.708 --> 05:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
unable to do so because of the
 
05:17:47.830 --> 05:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
the the growth of the disease um all
 
05:17:50.150 --> 05:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
right is attributable to intellectual
 
05:17:53.750 --> 05:17:53.760 align:start position:0%

autism
 
05:17:57.990 --> 05:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
um and then i've asked that we put
 
05:18:00.470 --> 05:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
familial dysautonomia
 
05:18:02.788 --> 05:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
into that or
 
05:18:05.750 --> 05:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
a specific learning disability or any
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
other condition of an individual
 
05:18:10.628 --> 05:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
found to be closely related to an
 
05:18:13.670 --> 05:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability as it refers to
 
05:18:15.510 --> 05:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
general intellectual functioning or
 
05:18:15.520 --> 05:18:16.628 align:start position:0%

05:18:20.000 --> 05:18:21.030 align:start position:0%

05:18:22.550 --> 05:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
similar to that
 
05:18:24.150 --> 05:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
required for persons with an
 
05:18:26.788 --> 05:18:26.798 align:start position:0%

05:18:31.110 --> 05:18:31.120 align:start position:0%

uh revising all of this
 
05:18:45.670 --> 05:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
but if we look at it carefully i'm quite
 
05:18:45.680 --> 05:18:46.948 align:start position:0%
but if we look at it carefully i'm quite
convinced

05:18:46.948 --> 05:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
convinced
 
05:18:46.958 --> 05:18:49.030 align:start position:0%
convinced
that

05:18:49.030 --> 05:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:18:49.040 --> 05:18:50.390 align:start position:0%
that
that

05:18:50.390 --> 05:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:18:53.190 --> 05:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
other conditions like cerebral palsy or
 
05:18:53.200 --> 05:18:55.110 align:start position:0%
other conditions like cerebral palsy or
epilepsy

05:18:55.110 --> 05:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
epilepsy
 
05:18:57.750 --> 05:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
that are not intellectual disabilities
 
05:19:02.708 --> 05:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:05.030 --> 05:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
if one reads it right from the beginning
 
05:19:06.628 --> 05:19:06.638 align:start position:0%
attributable to an intellectual
 
05:19:09.270 --> 05:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
disability one could stop and say oh
 
05:19:12.550 --> 05:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
well in my in the case of my condition
 
05:19:15.910 --> 05:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
that's not there i i hope i'm explaining
 
05:19:17.670 --> 05:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
why why we think there's some there's
 
05:19:19.510 --> 05:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
05:19:21.990 --> 05:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's possible to be ambiguous it's
 
05:19:25.110 --> 05:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
possible to to have different uh
 
05:19:28.070 --> 05:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
different interpretations of this oh it
 
05:19:28.080 --> 05:19:29.110 align:start position:0%
different interpretations of this oh it
also

05:19:29.110 --> 05:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
means that fd also meets the conditions
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
in on line 9 b
 
05:19:37.750 --> 05:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
which originate before an individual
 
05:19:41.110 --> 05:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
attains age 22. these are all present as
 
05:19:42.470 --> 05:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
i said
 
05:19:45.910 --> 05:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
at birth a person is is born with is
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
born with this
 
05:19:47.280 --> 05:19:50.708 align:start position:0%
born with this
um

05:19:50.708 --> 05:19:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:53.430 --> 05:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
i've given you two sets of written
 
05:19:53.440 --> 05:19:54.788 align:start position:0%
i've given you two sets of written
testimony

05:19:54.788 --> 05:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:19:56.390 --> 05:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
my own
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
and that of
 
05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh miss bobby gross who is the mother of
 
05:20:05.670 --> 05:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
these three children and i and and
 
05:20:08.310 --> 05:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
at your leisure please read this because
 
05:20:10.550 --> 05:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
it will give you more
 
05:20:13.110 --> 05:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
of an idea of why we're
 
05:20:15.430 --> 05:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
why we're concerned and would like to
 
05:20:16.948 --> 05:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
add this
 
05:20:20.390 --> 05:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:22.470 --> 05:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill wish to
 
05:20:22.480 --> 05:20:23.590 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill wish to
clarify

05:20:23.590 --> 05:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
05:20:26.548 --> 05:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
that it's the legislature's intent that
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
the conditions found in this particular
 
05:20:31.430 --> 05:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure to call it
 
05:20:34.150 --> 05:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
syndrome disease
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
but in this in this
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
case um
 
05:20:40.868 --> 05:20:40.878 align:start position:0%
meet the meet the criteria that are
 
05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
already in the statute um
 
05:20:47.910 --> 05:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
and some people have suggested that this
 
05:20:49.830 --> 05:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
could be accomplished through the
 
05:20:54.390 --> 05:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
department uh legislative rules
 
05:20:57.510 --> 05:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
our cons our concern with that is
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
that we think members of the public
 
05:21:02.948 --> 05:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
don't know where to find the rules
 
05:21:04.628 --> 05:21:04.638 align:start position:0%
and that the place that one would look
 
05:21:07.030 --> 05:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
would be the rsa
 
05:21:09.590 --> 05:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
and and uh so
 
05:21:09.600 --> 05:21:10.788 align:start position:0%
and and uh so
that

05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
um if if this condition is deserving of
 
05:21:14.400 --> 05:21:15.430 align:start position:0%
um if if this condition is deserving of
of

05:21:15.430 --> 05:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:21:18.470 --> 05:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
developmental disability services the
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
the way to make the public understand
 
05:21:21.600 --> 05:21:22.548 align:start position:0%
the way to make the public understand
that

05:21:22.548 --> 05:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:21:23.430 --> 05:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:21:25.190 --> 05:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
best served by
 
05:21:28.310 --> 05:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh by having it in in the uh
 
05:21:31.750 --> 05:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the rsa i mean yes in the rsa and i'm
 
05:21:33.910 --> 05:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions and if i
 
05:21:35.510 --> 05:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer i'll get them for
 
05:21:35.520 --> 05:21:36.230 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer i'll get them for
you

05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:21:37.910 --> 05:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for the
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
presentation i'll call uh
 
05:21:45.910 --> 05:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:47.670 --> 05:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:21:50.788 --> 05:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question i had
 
05:21:53.350 --> 05:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was inattentive for a moment
 
05:21:56.548 --> 05:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
for which i apologize but i
 
05:21:58.948 --> 05:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
wondered as you were speaking i
 
05:22:01.030 --> 05:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the problems of
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
construction of the sentence here and
 
05:22:05.350 --> 05:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
particularly as it applies to this
 
05:22:07.190 --> 05:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
particular condition
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to know uh reasonable
 
05:22:10.868 --> 05:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
people could certainly come up with
 
05:22:13.030 --> 05:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
different conclusions but what i wanted
 
05:22:16.310 --> 05:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
to know is have has this family applied
 
05:22:18.948 --> 05:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
for services and have they been denied
 
05:22:18.958 --> 05:22:19.670 align:start position:0%
for services and have they been denied
or

05:22:19.670 --> 05:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:22:22.470 --> 05:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
have they applied at all they have my
 
05:22:24.628 --> 05:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they have applied
 
05:22:25.670 --> 05:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
they're in the
 
05:22:28.788 --> 05:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
application process and they have not
 
05:22:32.470 --> 05:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
not gotten an answer as of now thank you
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'll confirm that for you thank you
 
05:22:37.990 --> 05:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
05:22:40.230 --> 05:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um thank you for
 
05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question out actually it's two
 
05:22:44.470 --> 05:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
parts one is
 
05:22:46.948 --> 05:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
this is a very rare
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
disease i'm assuming um do we know how
 
05:22:51.990 --> 05:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
many are in the state
 
05:22:52.000 --> 05:22:53.190 align:start position:0%
many are in the state
uh

05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:22:56.310 --> 05:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
miss gross says there are two in her
 
05:22:59.910 --> 05:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
in her uh testim written testimony i
 
05:23:03.750 --> 05:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
don't know that for sure but it uh
 
05:23:05.590 --> 05:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
i guess there probably are some people
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
who probably
 
05:23:09.190 --> 05:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
may have this and don't know that they i
 
05:23:11.030 --> 05:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
mean they know they have a problem and
 
05:23:13.590 --> 05:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
don't know that it's this but
 
05:23:19.510 --> 05:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh i believe the number uh in in uh is
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
a few hundred in the united states and
 
05:23:22.080 --> 05:23:23.030 align:start position:0%
a few hundred in the united states and
maybe

05:23:23.030 --> 05:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
05:23:25.750 --> 05:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
several hundred more in the in the rest
 
05:23:28.470 --> 05:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
of the world so it's it's rare
 
05:23:31.270 --> 05:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you my follow-up to that is and it
 
05:23:33.270 --> 05:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
might be answered better by one of the
 
05:23:35.430 --> 05:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
doctors in the room
 
05:23:35.440 --> 05:23:36.230 align:start position:0%
doctors in the room
uh

05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:23:38.830 --> 05:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
when we were just discussing the
 
05:23:38.840 --> 05:23:40.708 align:start position:0%
when we were just discussing the
uh

05:23:40.708 --> 05:23:40.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:23:42.310 --> 05:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
pain issue
 
05:23:45.190 --> 05:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
with diagnose for marijuana we talked
 
05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
about did we want to get into the
 
05:23:46.958 --> 05:23:48.948 align:start position:0%
about did we want to get into the
details

05:23:48.948 --> 05:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
details
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
is this
 
05:23:55.510 --> 05:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:56.310 --> 05:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
do you
 
05:23:56.320 --> 05:23:57.110 align:start position:0%
do you
and

05:23:57.110 --> 05:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:57.120 --> 05:23:57.990 align:start position:0%
and
yeah

05:23:57.990 --> 05:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:24:01.110 --> 05:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the doctor sorry
 
05:24:03.030 --> 05:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how to answer that i'll
 
05:24:06.310 --> 05:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
repres recognize representative kenner
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
but i was not going to state it as an
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
answer to that i wanted to just point
 
05:24:11.990 --> 05:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
out that now point out him to ask
 
05:24:13.590 --> 05:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
we just went through a long discussion
 
05:24:16.150 --> 05:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
about the hazards of making lists of
 
05:24:18.230 --> 05:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
diagnoses because then if it's not
 
05:24:20.548 --> 05:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
listed then it seems to be excluded and
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
this is the same problem we're running
 
05:24:23.430 --> 05:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
into here
 
05:24:25.430 --> 05:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
05:24:29.510 --> 05:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
that i'm asking would not this fit
 
05:24:30.470 --> 05:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
under the
 
05:24:32.230 --> 05:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
umbrella of
 
05:24:33.910 --> 05:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
forgetting about intellectual disability
 
05:24:36.310 --> 05:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
but closely related to intellectual
 
05:24:36.320 --> 05:24:37.830 align:start position:0%
but closely related to intellectual
disability

05:24:37.830 --> 05:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
disability
 
05:24:40.310 --> 05:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
or should we just simply change that to
 
05:24:41.910 --> 05:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
something closely related to a
 
05:24:44.070 --> 05:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
developmental disability so you get rid
 
05:24:46.390 --> 05:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
of that word intellectual and improve
 
05:24:48.708 --> 05:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
the size of the umbrella because i'm
 
05:24:50.788 --> 05:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
sure there are a lot of other
 
05:24:52.868 --> 05:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
developmental disability issues
 
05:24:54.868 --> 05:24:54.878 align:start position:0%
besides what we have listed here even
 
05:24:57.350 --> 05:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
adding fd that would appear to then
 
05:24:58.868 --> 05:24:58.878 align:start position:0%
still be excluded
 
05:24:58.878 --> 05:24:59.910 align:start position:0%
still be excluded
um

05:24:59.910 --> 05:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:00.868 --> 05:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
i'm caught on how to do it do you think
 
05:25:04.708 --> 05:25:04.718 align:start position:0%
that if we just got rid of the word
 
05:25:06.628 --> 05:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
intellectual in
 
05:25:06.638 --> 05:25:07.750 align:start position:0%
intellectual in
six

05:25:07.750 --> 05:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
six
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
or in four change that to developmental
 
05:25:12.150 --> 05:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
so we took out the concept of
 
05:25:12.160 --> 05:25:13.670 align:start position:0%
so we took out the concept of
intellectual

05:25:13.670 --> 05:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
intellectual
 
05:25:16.830 --> 05:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
that that would be sufficient
 
05:25:16.840 --> 05:25:18.628 align:start position:0%
that that would be sufficient
to

05:25:18.628 --> 05:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:25:20.628 --> 05:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
open up the umbrella a little bit bigger
 
05:25:22.708 --> 05:25:22.718 align:start position:0%
but not have the exclusionary aspect of
 
05:25:23.910 --> 05:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
a list
 
05:25:23.920 --> 05:25:24.788 align:start position:0%
a list
um

05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:27.030 --> 05:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
that that that might be
 
05:25:27.040 --> 05:25:28.310 align:start position:0%
that that that might be
a

05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
a solution i i don't know the only state
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
that i know that has passed
 
05:25:35.280 --> 05:25:36.788 align:start position:0%
that i know that has passed
legislation

05:25:36.788 --> 05:25:36.798 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:25:40.150 --> 05:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh that include speaks to this
 
05:25:40.160 --> 05:25:42.470 align:start position:0%
uh that include speaks to this
fd

05:25:42.470 --> 05:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
fd
 
05:25:42.480 --> 05:25:43.750 align:start position:0%
fd
condition

05:25:43.750 --> 05:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
condition
 
05:25:46.310 --> 05:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
is the state of new york and they went
 
05:25:48.150 --> 05:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
through and wrote a whole
 
05:25:49.590 --> 05:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
new section
 
05:25:53.110 --> 05:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh that covers that takes many of the
 
05:25:54.548 --> 05:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
things that are in
 
05:25:54.558 --> 05:25:55.430 align:start position:0%
things that are in
um

05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:58.948 --> 05:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
what's the number here uh 171
 
05:26:03.750 --> 05:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
rsa 171 and put it into a new statute i
 
05:26:05.670 --> 05:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
don't think that's necessary in new
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think everything's pretty
 
05:26:07.200 --> 05:26:08.150 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think everything's pretty
clear

05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:26:10.390 --> 05:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
so follow-up
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
the second question that comes into that
 
05:26:14.708 --> 05:26:14.718 align:start position:0%
same issue is there's often a very broad
 
05:26:16.628 --> 05:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
spectrum of development disabilities for
 
05:26:18.390 --> 05:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
example even the whole thing of cerebral
 
05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
palsy can be quite severe or can be just
 
05:26:24.548 --> 05:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
a mild limp that's still cerebral palsy
 
05:26:27.270 --> 05:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
is there a mechanism further in statute
 
05:26:30.230 --> 05:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
or is it in rules in which the severity
 
05:26:31.990 --> 05:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the developmental disability is
 
05:26:33.510 --> 05:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
assessed to be sure that the person
 
05:26:34.708 --> 05:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
actually needs
 
05:26:36.788 --> 05:26:36.798 align:start position:0%
services since some of these
 
05:26:38.310 --> 05:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
may never require services because
 
05:26:43.430 --> 05:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:45.750 --> 05:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
i don't again i don't know the answer if
 
05:26:48.070 --> 05:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
someone is from uh department of health
 
05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
and human services we may be able to get
 
05:26:52.788 --> 05:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
it from them uh these particular
 
05:26:55.190 --> 05:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
individuals whom i know
 
05:26:57.510 --> 05:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh and have known for a long time
 
05:27:01.350 --> 05:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh they have very severe physical
 
05:27:01.360 --> 05:27:02.708 align:start position:0%
uh they have very severe physical
uh

05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:05.910 --> 05:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
problems and i would think if they would
 
05:27:08.310 --> 05:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria but
 
05:27:10.390 --> 05:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
the chair inquires as to whether there
 
05:27:15.430 --> 05:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
is anyone from any of the 10 area
 
05:27:15.440 --> 05:27:17.030 align:start position:0%
is anyone from any of the 10 area
agencies

05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
05:27:20.230 --> 05:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
here present in the room
 
05:27:23.510 --> 05:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
or i realize jonathan ruthier has moved
 
05:27:26.548 --> 05:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
on but his replacement in the group that
 
05:27:29.030 --> 05:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
looks over the 10 area agencies is there
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
anyone here from that group
 
05:27:34.788 --> 05:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
i've had some conversations
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
with them
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
and um would you believe representative
 
05:27:40.320 --> 05:27:41.270 align:start position:0%
and um would you believe representative
that

05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:43.750 --> 05:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
what we've just heard is virtually word
 
05:27:45.990 --> 05:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
for word what they've said to me
 
05:27:49.350 --> 05:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
in that they do not in any way dismiss
 
05:27:50.830 --> 05:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
this specific
 
05:27:53.430 --> 05:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
issue but they would much rather make
 
05:27:56.788 --> 05:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
broader categories otherwise we left one
 
05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
out and we've got to come back next year
 
05:28:01.750 --> 05:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
and so on um
 
05:28:01.760 --> 05:28:03.190 align:start position:0%
and so on um
with

05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:28:05.750 --> 05:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
would you be um well it's our bill i
 
05:28:07.590 --> 05:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
realize but you are the prime sponsor
 
05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
and would you think it an apt thing to
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
do that perhaps we reworked the bill to
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
make broader categories
 
05:28:17.510 --> 05:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
rather than single out this particular
 
05:28:20.230 --> 05:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
one and then another year another one uh
 
05:28:23.030 --> 05:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
i agree with you completely i wrote the
 
05:28:25.350 --> 05:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
bill this way to make it to do it as
 
05:28:27.030 --> 05:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
simply as i could
 
05:28:29.030 --> 05:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
knowing that that was a
 
05:28:31.510 --> 05:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
weakness in the bill i i think that's
 
05:28:34.230 --> 05:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
what my committee commerce would do with
 
05:28:36.310 --> 05:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
the comparable
 
05:28:38.470 --> 05:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh comparable situation
 
05:28:39.910 --> 05:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
05:28:43.590 --> 05:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:44.788 --> 05:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:28:44.798 --> 05:28:45.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

05:28:45.990 --> 05:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
whatever's the matter with the bill you
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
didn't write the write it somebody else
 
05:28:51.110 --> 05:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
wrote it
 
05:28:53.670 --> 05:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
that needs to be rewritten and one of
 
05:28:55.030 --> 05:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
the problems is
 
05:28:55.040 --> 05:28:55.910 align:start position:0%
the problems is
as

05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:28:58.230 --> 05:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm so glad that if everybody wants
 
05:29:00.070 --> 05:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
to rework this because it is so
 
05:29:00.080 --> 05:29:01.910 align:start position:0%
to rework this because it is so
important

05:29:01.910 --> 05:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
but we can't exactly substitute in this
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
developmental for intellectual because
 
05:29:10.708 --> 05:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
this whole paragraph is supposed to be
 
05:29:10.718 --> 05:29:12.070 align:start position:0%
this whole paragraph is supposed to be
defining

05:29:12.070 --> 05:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
defining
 
05:29:12.080 --> 05:29:13.510 align:start position:0%
defining
developmental

05:29:13.510 --> 05:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
05:29:13.520 --> 05:29:14.948 align:start position:0%
developmental
disability

05:29:14.948 --> 05:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
disability
 
05:29:16.708 --> 05:29:16.718 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have to
 
05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
think really long and hard
 
05:29:21.750 --> 05:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
how to make the umbrella big and not
 
05:29:25.990 --> 05:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:29.190 --> 05:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
yes i mean it it's it's very possible
 
05:29:31.670 --> 05:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
that there could be
 
05:29:32.708 --> 05:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
a new
 
05:29:35.670 --> 05:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
a and b or an a b and c and where there
 
05:29:37.510 --> 05:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
was a place in which
 
05:29:40.708 --> 05:29:40.718 align:start position:0%
it was clear that there were several
 
05:29:44.390 --> 05:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of conditions that that would be
 
05:29:47.110 --> 05:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
would fit and it wouldn't be necessary
 
05:29:47.120 --> 05:29:47.910 align:start position:0%
would fit and it wouldn't be necessary
to

05:29:47.910 --> 05:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:29:47.920 --> 05:29:48.868 align:start position:0%
to
to

05:29:48.868 --> 05:29:48.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:29:51.750 --> 05:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
have lists and so forth
 
05:29:54.708 --> 05:29:54.718 align:start position:0%
anything yet representative weber
 
05:29:56.310 --> 05:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:29:59.030 --> 05:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:30:02.070 --> 05:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
would it possibly be a fix
 
05:30:04.708 --> 05:30:04.718 align:start position:0%
grammatically and
 
05:30:08.150 --> 05:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the sense if we simply
 
05:30:08.160 --> 05:30:10.830 align:start position:0%
in terms of the sense if we simply
add

05:30:10.830 --> 05:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
in intellectual or physical disability
 
05:30:18.548 --> 05:30:18.558 align:start position:0%
uh intellectual or physical disability
 
05:30:20.150 --> 05:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh i think
 
05:30:23.670 --> 05:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
sure but would the problem there not be
 
05:30:27.750 --> 05:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't have any idea
 
05:30:30.150 --> 05:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
how many people with how many different
 
05:30:30.160 --> 05:30:31.990 align:start position:0%
how many people with how many different
conditions

05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
05:30:35.110 --> 05:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
we may then be adding
 
05:30:37.670 --> 05:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
unless there's somebody here from dhhs
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
who might be able to help clarify that
 
05:30:41.430 --> 05:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
for us
 
05:30:43.270 --> 05:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
05:30:49.510 --> 05:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:51.670 --> 05:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:58.948 --> 05:30:58.958 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that if we add in the word
 
05:31:01.510 --> 05:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
physical disability we've solved the
 
05:31:03.670 --> 05:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
problem of the umbrella
 
05:31:06.470 --> 05:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
but we have created another problem
 
05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
which is we don't have any idea
 
05:31:12.310 --> 05:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
how many people we are bringing in under
 
05:31:13.830 --> 05:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
that umbrella
 
05:31:16.310 --> 05:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:31:16.320 --> 05:31:17.670 align:start position:0%
and uh
unless

05:31:17.670 --> 05:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
unless
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
because you can't answer that question
 
05:31:21.030 --> 05:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
for us so maybe there's somebody else
 
05:31:23.910 --> 05:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
here who might be able to answer it
 
05:31:27.270 --> 05:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
um well i would say that that i believe
 
05:31:30.948 --> 05:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
that the intent of the of the current
 
05:31:33.030 --> 05:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
legislation is
 
05:31:35.590 --> 05:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
that all the people in with many
 
05:31:37.590 --> 05:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
different kinds of conditions could
 
05:31:39.750 --> 05:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
apply and this would seem to indicate
 
05:31:41.190 --> 05:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
they're already
 
05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
already are eligible but there's
 
05:31:47.350 --> 05:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
it but it seems to be ambiguous
 
05:31:49.990 --> 05:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
so i think your your suggestion is good
 
05:31:50.000 --> 05:31:51.350 align:start position:0%
so i think your your suggestion is good
um

05:31:51.350 --> 05:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:54.390 --> 05:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
i i believe also in in terms of of of
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:31:57.910 --> 05:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
expansion of
 
05:31:59.430 --> 05:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
the number of people
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
requiring or requesting
 
05:32:01.680 --> 05:32:02.470 align:start position:0%
requiring or requesting
uh

05:32:02.470 --> 05:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:32:02.480 --> 05:32:04.868 align:start position:0%
uh
services

05:32:04.868 --> 05:32:04.878 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:32:08.628 --> 05:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
is really going to be answered by
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
how much money is appropriated and
 
05:32:13.270 --> 05:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
whether people how many people could be
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
eligible i don't think this is a
 
05:32:15.120 --> 05:32:17.830 align:start position:0%
eligible i don't think this is a
zero-sum

05:32:17.830 --> 05:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
zero-sum
 
05:32:19.990 --> 05:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
but i think that that would
 
05:32:22.548 --> 05:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
that would seem to indicate what what i
 
05:32:24.788 --> 05:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
think would happen in the future
 
05:32:26.708 --> 05:32:26.718 align:start position:0%
and i think would happen under under the
 
05:32:28.470 --> 05:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
current language as well
 
05:32:30.230 --> 05:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative might you guessed that
 
05:32:32.070 --> 05:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
i've had exactly this conversation
 
05:32:33.830 --> 05:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
already with the developmentally
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
disabled community because while they do
 
05:32:38.708 --> 05:32:38.718 align:start position:0%
wish to bring in appropriate very small
 
05:32:40.470 --> 05:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
groups such as this group and the
 
05:32:42.390 --> 05:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
language they used with me is we believe
 
05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
there's two in the state
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
they don't want it to be a free-for-all
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
because that would sink the boat
 
05:32:49.350 --> 05:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
05:32:53.110 --> 05:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
i i i would i would i would believe it
 
05:32:54.548 --> 05:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
thank you i would believe it and that's
 
05:32:57.750 --> 05:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
why i only put one into the bill
 
05:33:00.310 --> 05:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
but this gets a go this gets us going
 
05:33:02.788 --> 05:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
05:33:04.390 --> 05:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:33:06.070 --> 05:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for taking this
 
05:33:08.470 --> 05:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
question which
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's not quite a question but i'll try
 
05:33:11.750 --> 05:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
to make it into a question
 
05:33:11.760 --> 05:33:13.270 align:start position:0%
to make it into a question
um

05:33:13.270 --> 05:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:17.670 --> 05:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:20.150 --> 05:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
since i since i believe that there are a
 
05:33:21.110 --> 05:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
05:33:23.590 --> 05:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
genetic anomalies
 
05:33:23.600 --> 05:33:24.548 align:start position:0%
genetic anomalies
that

05:33:24.548 --> 05:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:33:26.548 --> 05:33:26.558 align:start position:0%
are categorized as developmental
 
05:33:28.868 --> 05:33:28.878 align:start position:0%
disabilities but might fit more clearly
 
05:33:32.230 --> 05:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
under the umbrella as it's written
 
05:33:33.830 --> 05:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if this wouldn't be a
 
05:33:36.070 --> 05:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
place to do some research about how
 
05:33:39.670 --> 05:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
other states rsas are written
 
05:33:41.510 --> 05:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
with the definition of developmentally
 
05:33:41.520 --> 05:33:44.070 align:start position:0%
with the definition of developmentally
disabled

05:33:44.070 --> 05:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:46.070 --> 05:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
that still wasn't a question would you
 
05:33:49.750 --> 05:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:52.310 --> 05:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh to the degree that i understand that
 
05:33:53.350 --> 05:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
yes i
 
05:33:56.230 --> 05:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good idea but i i would
 
05:33:59.590 --> 05:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
like to say that my hope
 
05:33:59.600 --> 05:34:00.470 align:start position:0%
like to say that my hope
is

05:34:00.470 --> 05:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:07.350 --> 05:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
making progress on this because we were
 
05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
studying it for another year
 
05:34:12.548 --> 05:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
representative woods while i asked the
 
05:34:14.948 --> 05:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
fourth floor to do research
 
05:34:16.390 --> 05:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:34:18.150 --> 05:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question i just need to
 
05:34:19.990 --> 05:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit of the actual
 
05:34:22.230 --> 05:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
physical process by which these services
 
05:34:23.670 --> 05:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
would be provided
 
05:34:26.150 --> 05:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that almost anybody
 
05:34:29.590 --> 05:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of diagnosis can apply for if
 
05:34:32.230 --> 05:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
they feel that the need is there
 
05:34:34.310 --> 05:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
for supportive services
 
05:34:35.750 --> 05:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
then they have to go through and there
 
05:34:38.150 --> 05:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
are physicians who are either dedicated
 
05:34:39.990 --> 05:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the department or
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
ancillary services outside the
 
05:34:44.788 --> 05:34:44.798 align:start position:0%
department to provide those diagnoses
 
05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
and say yes they need the following
 
05:34:46.718 --> 05:34:47.830 align:start position:0%
and say yes they need the following
services

05:34:47.830 --> 05:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:34:49.750 --> 05:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
and we physicians especially
 
05:34:51.990 --> 05:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
orthopedists do this on a regular basis
 
05:34:54.390 --> 05:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
like for workers comp
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know you have an injury are you
 
05:34:58.150 --> 05:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
impaired can you not do this job blah
 
05:34:59.670 --> 05:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
blah blah
 
05:35:01.350 --> 05:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
and provide
 
05:35:03.030 --> 05:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions and
 
05:35:05.190 --> 05:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
on their work area
 
05:35:08.390 --> 05:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
is that the same process such that
 
05:35:11.990 --> 05:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:13.590 --> 05:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
making a list doesn't help they still
 
05:35:14.708 --> 05:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
have to get
 
05:35:18.070 --> 05:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:20.948 --> 05:35:20.958 align:start position:0%
the physical exam by somebody who then
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
through the state says yes
 
05:35:27.270 --> 05:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
they have a criteria to provide services
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
so then the backup question is do we
 
05:35:32.628 --> 05:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
i i think that this committee really
 
05:35:38.390 --> 05:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
would be able to decide that
 
05:35:40.628 --> 05:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
um i
 
05:35:43.270 --> 05:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of whatever is the best
 
05:35:45.270 --> 05:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
best solution for that
 
05:35:47.110 --> 05:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
05:35:49.590 --> 05:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i guess simplifying the
 
05:35:49.600 --> 05:35:50.788 align:start position:0%
thank you i guess simplifying the
question

05:35:50.788 --> 05:35:50.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
even though i have a diagnosis of
 
05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
familiar autonomia
 
05:35:57.670 --> 05:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's autonomy excuse me um and i applied
 
05:36:00.788 --> 05:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
for services i would still go through
 
05:36:04.230 --> 05:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
the physical exam and get uh that then
 
05:36:06.390 --> 05:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
would be certified that in fact they do
 
05:36:08.628 --> 05:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
need services so the title itself
 
05:36:10.548 --> 05:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't guarantee you service no it
 
05:36:12.788 --> 05:36:12.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't guarantee it doesn't guarantee
 
05:36:12.798 --> 05:36:13.670 align:start position:0%
doesn't guarantee it doesn't guarantee
services

05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:36:16.470 --> 05:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
and i i believe there are other criteria
 
05:36:19.190 --> 05:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
about perhaps about family income and so
 
05:36:21.110 --> 05:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
forth that have something to do with
 
05:36:23.430 --> 05:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
this but i i don't know how that process
 
05:36:29.190 --> 05:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:31.350 --> 05:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
last one representative gay
 
05:36:32.628 --> 05:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:36:35.510 --> 05:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh this brings up the subject of how
 
05:36:38.390 --> 05:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
many other people who are seriously
 
05:36:40.470 --> 05:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
handicapped because this sounds like a
 
05:36:42.830 --> 05:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
physical handicraft rather than an
 
05:36:46.310 --> 05:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
intellectual now i'm curious as to what
 
05:36:49.830 --> 05:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
services they are asking for under this
 
05:36:51.510 --> 05:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
this title
 
05:36:53.990 --> 05:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
maybe this is the only service they know
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
about you know the only title of
 
05:36:58.628 --> 05:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
services they're familiar with because
 
05:36:58.638 --> 05:36:59.350 align:start position:0%
services they're familiar with because
we

05:36:59.350 --> 05:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
surely we have some kind of services
 
05:37:04.868 --> 05:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
that are for people who are physically
 
05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
handicapped because that's what it
 
05:37:10.628 --> 05:37:10.638 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's developing here
 
05:37:12.628 --> 05:37:12.638 align:start position:0%
and that seems like that ought to be in
 
05:37:12.638 --> 05:37:14.390 align:start position:0%
and that seems like that ought to be in
consideration

05:37:14.390 --> 05:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
05:37:14.400 --> 05:37:15.750 align:start position:0%
consideration
uh

05:37:15.750 --> 05:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:17.590 --> 05:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
because obviously they need they deserve
 
05:37:18.948 --> 05:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
services but
 
05:37:21.030 --> 05:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
where what category do they go under and
 
05:37:23.110 --> 05:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
are there already people in that
 
05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
category that they ought to be put into
 
05:37:27.190 --> 05:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's the developmental
 
05:37:29.830 --> 05:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
disability category is serviced by 10
 
05:37:33.030 --> 05:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
area agencies overseen by the state this
 
05:37:36.310 --> 05:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
is just naming out one specific their
 
05:37:39.430 --> 05:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
concern is again as we've said
 
05:37:42.230 --> 05:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
you may be missing a few once you start
 
05:37:45.510 --> 05:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
specifically doing it what but this is
 
05:37:49.190 --> 05:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
to something that already exists serving
 
05:37:53.590 --> 05:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:56.150 --> 05:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
can i clarify my question
 
05:37:58.310 --> 05:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
don't we already have i
 
05:38:01.190 --> 05:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
i absolutely want to help these people
 
05:38:04.548 --> 05:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
don't we already have services that
 
05:38:08.150 --> 05:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
take care of people with physical
 
05:38:08.160 --> 05:38:10.470 align:start position:0%
take care of people with physical
advancing

05:38:10.470 --> 05:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
advancing
 
05:38:10.480 --> 05:38:11.750 align:start position:0%
advancing
illnesses

05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
illnesses
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
they're physical rather than
 
05:38:12.958 --> 05:38:15.510 align:start position:0%
they're physical rather than
intellectual

05:38:15.510 --> 05:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
intellectual
 
05:38:17.110 --> 05:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
if i can piggyback that then the
 
05:38:21.190 --> 05:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
question to the representative is
 
05:38:22.788 --> 05:38:22.798 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i came in in the middle of the
 
05:38:24.310 --> 05:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
hearing but
 
05:38:26.708 --> 05:38:26.718 align:start position:0%
why does this one need to be broken out
 
05:38:29.270 --> 05:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
specifically if that's so
 
05:38:29.280 --> 05:38:30.708 align:start position:0%
specifically if that's so
um

05:38:30.708 --> 05:38:30.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:32.070 --> 05:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
05:38:35.110 --> 05:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
that that if that is so and others would
 
05:38:38.230 --> 05:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
have to talk speak to that this is the
 
05:38:38.240 --> 05:38:39.110 align:start position:0%
have to talk speak to that this is the
only

05:38:39.110 --> 05:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:38:42.390 --> 05:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
only program that i'm aware of
 
05:38:42.400 --> 05:38:44.708 align:start position:0%
only program that i'm aware of
but

05:38:44.708 --> 05:38:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:47.590 --> 05:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
someone else could probably answer that
 
05:38:49.830 --> 05:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
and again with apologies for coming in
 
05:38:49.840 --> 05:38:50.708 align:start position:0%
and again with apologies for coming in
late

05:38:50.708 --> 05:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
late
 
05:38:52.788 --> 05:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
has the family
 
05:38:55.350 --> 05:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
attempted to get services and have been
 
05:38:55.360 --> 05:38:56.628 align:start position:0%
attempted to get services and have been
rebuffed

05:38:56.628 --> 05:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
rebuffed
 
05:38:59.910 --> 05:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
hence the need for a breakout
 
05:39:01.670 --> 05:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
listing of this diagnosis an excellent
 
05:39:04.548 --> 05:39:04.558 align:start position:0%
question and we discussed that a little
 
05:39:06.548 --> 05:39:06.558 align:start position:0%
earlier uh
 
05:39:09.110 --> 05:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
the family has uh
 
05:39:11.750 --> 05:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
is in the application process
 
05:39:14.548 --> 05:39:14.558 align:start position:0%
and they have not it has not moved
 
05:39:17.430 --> 05:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
to its conclusion yet so i we don't know
 
05:39:20.390 --> 05:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
what the response will be and and it may
 
05:39:21.590 --> 05:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
be yes
 
05:39:21.600 --> 05:39:22.788 align:start position:0%
be yes
um

05:39:22.788 --> 05:39:22.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:25.110 --> 05:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
i i just don't know i guess i'm ahead of
 
05:39:26.948 --> 05:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
the curve a little bit no but what
 
05:39:29.430 --> 05:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
you've done um thank you is open up a
 
05:39:32.070 --> 05:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
good topic here for broadening of the
 
05:39:34.390 --> 05:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
care as necessary so thank you so much
 
05:39:36.070 --> 05:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
for coming you're very welcome thank you
 
05:39:38.548 --> 05:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
for letting me yes oh yes sorry before
 
05:39:40.390 --> 05:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
you look you leave
 
05:39:42.230 --> 05:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative abel uh
 
05:39:45.030 --> 05:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
a question relative to dealing with the
 
05:39:46.708 --> 05:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
area agencies
 
05:39:49.350 --> 05:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
and specific to the funding mechanism
 
05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
that's coming from the state it's
 
05:39:52.788 --> 05:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
medicare medicaid as well
 
05:39:55.990 --> 05:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
for it is that is identifying the issues
 
05:39:58.948 --> 05:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
that need addressing and the everything
 
05:40:00.708 --> 05:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
has an acronym and what it is it's
 
05:40:02.708 --> 05:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
called an isp or an individual service
 
05:40:02.718 --> 05:40:03.670 align:start position:0%
called an isp or an individual service
plan

05:40:03.670 --> 05:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
plan
 
05:40:05.830 --> 05:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
has that uh does that sound familiar to
 
05:40:06.868 --> 05:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
you at all and what the folks have
 
05:40:06.878 --> 05:40:08.070 align:start position:0%
you at all and what the folks have
addressed

05:40:08.070 --> 05:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
05:40:09.830 --> 05:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh in dealing with through the area
 
05:40:09.840 --> 05:40:10.868 align:start position:0%
uh in dealing with through the area
agency

05:40:10.868 --> 05:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
agency
 
05:40:14.788 --> 05:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
i i'm i i i'm familiar with the with an
 
05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
isp i don't uh
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:40:22.390 --> 05:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
i believe uh until
 
05:40:22.400 --> 05:40:23.270 align:start position:0%
i believe uh until
now

05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:40:26.470 --> 05:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh this family has uh
 
05:40:28.708 --> 05:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
used its own resources
 
05:40:31.750 --> 05:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh i know they had 24-hour care and so
 
05:40:33.750 --> 05:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
forth and now
 
05:40:35.670 --> 05:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
with the mother
 
05:40:38.548 --> 05:40:38.558 align:start position:0%
being in her late 70s
 
05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
she's concerned what will happen when
 
05:40:44.150 --> 05:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
she's not there and so i think that they
 
05:40:46.708 --> 05:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
are perhaps only applying now for the
 
05:40:48.310 --> 05:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
first time
 
05:40:50.788 --> 05:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
uh and i i will find that out for sure
 
05:40:51.990 --> 05:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
and i will get back to you
 
05:40:54.310 --> 05:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative could you email me
 
05:40:57.670 --> 05:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh the chair could you email me as to
 
05:40:59.750 --> 05:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
where this person is located i don't
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
need to know their name so i can contact
 
05:41:04.628 --> 05:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
the appropriate area agencies
 
05:41:06.548 --> 05:41:06.558 align:start position:0%
there in lebanon new hampshire west
 
05:41:08.628 --> 05:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
lebanon new hampshire it would be west
 
05:41:10.548 --> 05:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
central i believe all right i'm sorry

call the area agency to see if i can
expedite

05:41:17.670 --> 05:41:17.680 align:start position:0%

no privacy here i i got it now thank you
 
05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative soloway

thank you mr chairman um
 
05:41:27.510 --> 05:41:27.520 align:start position:0%

respect and affection i have for you and
 
05:41:31.110 --> 05:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
your entire family
 
05:41:34.628 --> 05:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
and i must add for the gross family
 
05:41:36.150 --> 05:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
their oldest son used to pack my
 
05:41:41.270 --> 05:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:43.750 --> 05:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
are they not eligible for
 
05:41:47.190 --> 05:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
a disability under social security which
 
05:41:48.948 --> 05:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
would provide them some income in
 
05:41:48.958 --> 05:41:50.150 align:start position:0%
would provide them some income in
medicare

05:41:50.150 --> 05:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
medicare
 
05:41:50.160 --> 05:41:51.430 align:start position:0%
medicare
i

05:41:51.430 --> 05:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:41:52.390 --> 05:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
will ask
 
05:41:54.788 --> 05:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
i would imagine they would be and i will
 
05:41:57.270 --> 05:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
find out for you and do you think it
 
05:41:59.670 --> 05:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
would be possible to reframe
 
05:42:02.548 --> 05:42:02.558 align:start position:0%
this uh legislation uh under an
 
05:42:05.670 --> 05:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
amendment process so that we have a
 
05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
larger umbrella without identifying
 
05:42:10.868 --> 05:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
specific diagnoses
 
05:42:12.548 --> 05:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that would be an excellent
 
05:42:14.948 --> 05:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
idea if you can look at that thank you
 
05:42:17.030 --> 05:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
so very much for doing this and when you
 
05:42:18.628 --> 05:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
see the grossest please send them my
 
05:42:20.868 --> 05:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
warm up i will do so thank you chair
 
05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to give a point of
 
05:42:28.230 --> 05:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
information that is if you go to 171 a6
 
05:42:30.548 --> 05:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
that talks about the entry and they do a
 
05:42:32.070 --> 05:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
comprehensive screening evaluation to
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
determine the scope of the disability
 
05:42:35.510 --> 05:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
and what is needed so it would seem that
 
05:42:38.390 --> 05:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis is irrelevant as uh
 
05:42:39.990 --> 05:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
representing wood said because you have
 
05:42:41.750 --> 05:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
to know what are the needs because
 
05:42:43.350 --> 05:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
there's a spectrum for almost all these
 
05:42:46.310 --> 05:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
diagnoses so if you look at 171 a6
 
05:42:47.990 --> 05:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
that'll give you
 
05:42:49.830 --> 05:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
that's the bolts of how it works once
 
05:42:56.070 --> 05:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:57.990 --> 05:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes attorney
 
05:43:00.868 --> 05:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
melissa is it nameth
 
05:43:07.510 --> 05:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:09.110 --> 05:43:09.120 align:start position:0%

05:43:19.030 --> 05:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:43:20.470 --> 05:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
it gets pronounced different ways all
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
the time so uh no words welcome
 
05:43:22.400 --> 05:43:23.430 align:start position:0%
the time so uh no words welcome
counselor

05:43:23.430 --> 05:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
05:43:24.788 --> 05:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:24.798 --> 05:43:25.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:43:25.750 --> 05:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:27.510 --> 05:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
i am an attorney with the department and
 
05:43:29.750 --> 05:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
specifically i provide legal counsel to
 
05:43:32.548 --> 05:43:32.558 align:start position:0%
the bureau of developmental services
 
05:43:34.948 --> 05:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to come today to provide
 
05:43:34.958 --> 05:43:36.310 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to come today to provide
information

05:43:36.310 --> 05:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:43:37.910 --> 05:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
and a lot of what we were going to
 
05:43:40.470 --> 05:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
provide has actually been addressed
 
05:43:43.350 --> 05:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
05:43:46.070 --> 05:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
creating lists and and the hazards that
 
05:43:48.868 --> 05:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
that can create um but hearing some of
 
05:43:50.948 --> 05:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
the other questions from from members of
 
05:43:53.190 --> 05:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
the committee what i would also say is
 
05:43:54.868 --> 05:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
05:43:56.948 --> 05:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
you're changing
 
05:43:59.430 --> 05:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
maybe taking this diagnosis out but
 
05:44:01.030 --> 05:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise changing the statute there
 
05:44:03.270 --> 05:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
would be a lot of considerations that
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
would would have to go into play and i
 
05:44:06.948 --> 05:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
know one one question was about funding
 
05:44:10.310 --> 05:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
and um of course this these services are
 
05:44:12.628 --> 05:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
primarily funded through
 
05:44:14.470 --> 05:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid waivers
 
05:44:15.910 --> 05:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
and so we have agreements with the
 
05:44:18.070 --> 05:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
center for medicare medicaid services
 
05:44:20.150 --> 05:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
that would have to be addressed and we
 
05:44:22.548 --> 05:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
have created systems in such a way that
 
05:44:25.110 --> 05:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
we you have described how we provide the
 
05:44:26.868 --> 05:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
services so it's not to say that you
 
05:44:28.788 --> 05:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
know it can't be done or couldn't be
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
done but i think there's a lot more that
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
goes into it than perhaps making some
 
05:44:36.868 --> 05:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
editorial changes to the statute as it
 
05:44:38.708 --> 05:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
sits currently
 
05:44:41.510 --> 05:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i did also want to clarify for this
 
05:44:43.030 --> 05:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
individual if it's in west lebanon it
 
05:44:44.948 --> 05:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
would be pathways of the river valley um
 
05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
i think it was indicated it might be
 
05:44:47.830 --> 05:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
west central but that's the community
 
05:44:49.590 --> 05:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
mental health center in that area
 
05:44:51.270 --> 05:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
pathway river valley
 
05:44:52.788 --> 05:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's pathways of the river
 
05:44:52.798 --> 05:44:56.470 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's pathways of the river
valley

05:44:56.470 --> 05:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:58.230 --> 05:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to take any
 
05:44:58.240 --> 05:45:00.708 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to take any
questions

05:45:00.708 --> 05:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:00.718 --> 05:45:02.788 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:45:02.788 --> 05:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:45:05.110 --> 05:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
i just i'm a little bit confused as to
 
05:45:06.548 --> 05:45:06.558 align:start position:0%
where you went with this because we
 
05:45:08.230 --> 05:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
talked about funding it would seem
 
05:45:09.990 --> 05:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
though since you still have criteria
 
05:45:12.390 --> 05:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
that is done in terms of the screening
 
05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
and because
 
05:45:15.750 --> 05:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
it is already written in a rather vague
 
05:45:15.760 --> 05:45:16.948 align:start position:0%
it is already written in a rather vague
fashion

05:45:16.948 --> 05:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
05:45:18.628 --> 05:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh whether you could
 
05:45:20.070 --> 05:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't call it loopholes but there's
 
05:45:22.070 --> 05:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a lot of ways to continue
 
05:45:24.628 --> 05:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
potentially qualifying this already yes
 
05:45:26.868 --> 05:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh with the vagueness of closely related
 
05:45:28.708 --> 05:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
to intellectual disability et cetera et
 
05:45:28.718 --> 05:45:29.590 align:start position:0%
to intellectual disability et cetera et
cetera

05:45:29.590 --> 05:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
cetera
 
05:45:31.270 --> 05:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
that if we just cleaned up the language
 
05:45:32.470 --> 05:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
05:45:34.310 --> 05:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't be opening a floodgate
 
05:45:36.310 --> 05:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
to all kinds of new care because you
 
05:45:38.628 --> 05:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
already have criteria you use
 
05:45:40.948 --> 05:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
as i just point out 171 862 and then
 
05:45:43.030 --> 05:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
also in your whole process
 
05:45:45.430 --> 05:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
that determines what
 
05:45:46.788 --> 05:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
needs and then of course we all know
 
05:45:48.470 --> 05:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
that there's funding issues but they're
 
05:45:51.110 --> 05:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
there currently yes so would it really
 
05:45:53.190 --> 05:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
open a floodgate i think it would depend
 
05:45:54.868 --> 05:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
on how
 
05:45:55.990 --> 05:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
changes were
 
05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh proposed to be made to the statute
 
05:45:58.948 --> 05:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
that we'd have to look at i agree that
 
05:46:00.390 --> 05:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's i think intentionally made made to
 
05:46:04.390 --> 05:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
be a wide door so that it captures as
 
05:46:06.390 --> 05:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
many people as possible um but i know
 
05:46:08.150 --> 05:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
there was i was hearing words but you
 
05:46:09.750 --> 05:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
know creating a bigger umbrella and
 
05:46:12.548 --> 05:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
potentially a bigger pool of folks to
 
05:46:14.390 --> 05:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
fall into this um that maybe wouldn't
 
05:46:16.708 --> 05:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
fall in as it's defined so um there's a
 
05:46:19.590 --> 05:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
potential it could be no difference
 
05:46:20.868 --> 05:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
and there's a potential depending on how
 
05:46:22.070 --> 05:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
the edits are made that there could be a
 
05:46:22.080 --> 05:46:23.750 align:start position:0%
the edits are made that there could be a
difference

05:46:23.750 --> 05:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:46:26.070 --> 05:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up could we ask you to perhaps
 
05:46:28.708 --> 05:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
provide some language that would not
 
05:46:30.628 --> 05:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
open up an umbrella that includes
 
05:46:31.750 --> 05:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state of new hampshire
 
05:46:32.708 --> 05:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
but would
 
05:46:32.718 --> 05:46:33.750 align:start position:0%
but would
would

05:46:33.750 --> 05:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
open it for what we're actually that
 
05:46:36.628 --> 05:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
people were actually talking about in
 
05:46:38.070 --> 05:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
other words maybe
 
05:46:39.750 --> 05:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
we talked about going to the for to oh
 
05:46:41.750 --> 05:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
well sorry research services and getting
 
05:46:43.590 --> 05:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
some information on the states but
 
05:46:45.110 --> 05:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know a better definition
 
05:46:46.470 --> 05:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
that could be used and if you could
 
05:46:47.990 --> 05:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
provide that to us
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful dhhs often
 
05:46:53.190 --> 05:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
gives us some draft ideas for amendments
 
05:46:54.948 --> 05:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
and then we wouldn't have to make a mess
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
of it
 
05:46:59.190 --> 05:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
we could do what would potentially work
 
05:47:01.910 --> 05:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
would you be kind enough to do that uh
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
yes i can certainly take that back on my
 
05:47:05.510 --> 05:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know obviously there's
 
05:47:06.868 --> 05:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
other layers i have to go through as
 
05:47:08.310 --> 05:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
well but um you know what i think what
 
05:47:09.990 --> 05:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
we would say is the the hope would be
 
05:47:12.470 --> 05:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
that um you know potentially these folks
 
05:47:13.670 --> 05:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
given the nature of their condition and
 
05:47:15.430 --> 05:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
going through the the evaluation you've
 
05:47:16.750 --> 05:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
described in
 
05:47:19.830 --> 05:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
171a6 that they may in fact
 
05:47:22.788 --> 05:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
already qualify um so but to the extent
 
05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
that maybe they wouldn't or
 
05:47:24.558 --> 05:47:25.510 align:start position:0%
that maybe they wouldn't or
um

05:47:25.510 --> 05:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:27.110 --> 05:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know there's a desire to have some
 
05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
edits i can certainly take that back and
 
05:47:32.230 --> 05:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:36.548 --> 05:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:47:39.990 --> 05:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:47:41.990 --> 05:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
05:47:44.070 --> 05:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
it would be wonderful if we found that
 
05:47:46.548 --> 05:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
this umbrella as it is written would
 
05:47:52.310 --> 05:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:54.708 --> 05:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
would you agree that the problem with
 
05:47:57.430 --> 05:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
word wordswhip mything here
 
05:48:00.070 --> 05:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
is that we have some of these things
 
05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
already in the list that are not like
 
05:48:03.590 --> 05:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
the others
 
05:48:07.030 --> 05:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
the statute speaks very clearly in
 
05:48:10.070 --> 05:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
almost every place to intellectual
 
05:48:10.080 --> 05:48:11.510 align:start position:0%
almost every place to intellectual
disabilities

05:48:11.510 --> 05:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
05:48:13.990 --> 05:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
not physical disabilities
 
05:48:14.000 --> 05:48:14.788 align:start position:0%
not physical disabilities
but

05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:48:17.270 --> 05:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
i know of people with both cerebral
 
05:48:20.310 --> 05:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
palsy and autism who are fiercely
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
intellectually competent
 
05:48:26.230 --> 05:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
who are nevertheless disabled
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
and their disabilities may be either
 
05:48:31.590 --> 05:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
physical ones or ones of relationship
 
05:48:34.548 --> 05:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
depending on the condition
 
05:48:34.558 --> 05:48:35.910 align:start position:0%
depending on the condition
so

05:48:35.910 --> 05:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
if we tried to simply broaden the
 
05:48:43.590 --> 05:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
category by adding physical disability
 
05:48:45.510 --> 05:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
and this is what i was trying to hint at
 
05:48:47.510 --> 05:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
with with representative abel and i was
 
05:48:50.230 --> 05:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
not doing it artfully and i'm sorry
 
05:48:53.510 --> 05:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
but is it isn't the problem that if we
 
05:48:56.310 --> 05:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
simply add the word physical disability
 
05:48:57.510 --> 05:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
in here
 
05:49:00.070 --> 05:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know how many people we are
 
05:49:00.080 --> 05:49:01.670 align:start position:0%
we don't know how many people we are
adding

05:49:01.670 --> 05:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
adding
 
05:49:03.590 --> 05:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
and we don't know how many conditions we
 
05:49:05.110 --> 05:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
are adding
 
05:49:06.708 --> 05:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
and if we
 
05:49:08.948 --> 05:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
on the other hand try and draft by
 
05:49:11.990 --> 05:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
putting in one more condition
 
05:49:14.628 --> 05:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
we are
 
05:49:17.110 --> 05:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
opening both opening the floodgates and
 
05:49:20.470 --> 05:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
making an already confusing statute more
 
05:49:23.990 --> 05:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
confusing is that is that the drafting
 
05:49:26.470 --> 05:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
problem that we're asking you to take on
 
05:49:27.990 --> 05:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
05:49:29.910 --> 05:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
yeah but but i would agree that with
 
05:49:32.230 --> 05:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
adding you know the just the word what
 
05:49:34.390 --> 05:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
might seem like a quick edit to add
 
05:49:36.628 --> 05:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
physical disabilities um if we were
 
05:49:38.708 --> 05:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
asked for example to do a fiscal note
 
05:49:41.590 --> 05:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
worksheet with that only that language
 
05:49:43.910 --> 05:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
we it would be undeterminable because
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's just no way to know how to
 
05:49:47.190 --> 05:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
capture that universe
 
05:49:49.350 --> 05:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
and also to to representative gay's
 
05:49:49.360 --> 05:49:50.390 align:start position:0%
and also to to representative gay's
question

05:49:50.390 --> 05:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:49:52.150 --> 05:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
previously about are there already
 
05:49:54.150 --> 05:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
services for folks with physical
 
05:49:54.160 --> 05:49:55.350 align:start position:0%
services for folks with physical
disabilities

05:49:55.350 --> 05:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
05:49:57.110 --> 05:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
i am not counsel for the bureau for
 
05:49:58.868 --> 05:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
elderly and adult services but i knew
 
05:50:00.868 --> 05:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
they do administer the choices for
 
05:50:03.030 --> 05:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
independence waiver and i think for some
 
05:50:04.628 --> 05:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
folks um
 
05:50:06.310 --> 05:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
with and i don't know i can't speak to
 
05:50:07.990 --> 05:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know these two um people that we've
 
05:50:10.230 --> 05:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
been talking about here today but there
 
05:50:12.390 --> 05:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
is that is another medicaid waiver
 
05:50:14.150 --> 05:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
program that is administered by a
 
05:50:16.390 --> 05:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
different arm of the department so
 
05:50:18.310 --> 05:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
it could be that some of those
 
05:50:20.948 --> 05:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
disabilities would be under that
 
05:50:22.868 --> 05:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
umbrella of services
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:25.270 --> 05:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
very helpful
 
05:50:28.868 --> 05:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
i believe representative merchant
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
had his hand up
 
05:50:32.708 --> 05:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
oh representative robert answered my
 
05:50:35.830 --> 05:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
quest to ask my question so thank you
 
05:50:40.390 --> 05:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:42.948 --> 05:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
thank you and um i have a feeling we're
 
05:50:44.868 --> 05:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
going to have a little uh
 
05:50:47.830 --> 05:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
discussion group formed on this
 
05:50:49.190 --> 05:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:50:51.110 --> 05:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
you're invited to join us oh well thank
 
05:50:53.350 --> 05:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome
 
05:50:55.670 --> 05:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative abel very
 
05:50:57.510 --> 05:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
much this is uh getting some things
 
05:51:00.470 --> 05:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
going for us
 
05:51:03.990 --> 05:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
that concludes the hearing for 1480. the
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
chair now opens
 
05:51:10.070 --> 05:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
with at the suggestion of representative
 
05:51:13.230 --> 05:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
weber a discussion on
 
05:51:16.470 --> 05:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
1619 the cannabis program
 
05:51:20.868 --> 05:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
um representative canuck left
 
05:51:25.510 --> 05:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
05:51:28.150 --> 05:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly fine
 
05:51:30.150 --> 05:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative nemeth i'd like i
 
05:51:31.830 --> 05:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
could have a card as well from you
 
05:51:33.830 --> 05:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
please and so we're going to open this
 
05:51:35.510 --> 05:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
up for 10 minutes before the next
 
05:51:37.510 --> 05:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
hearing is scheduled for further
 
05:51:40.390 --> 05:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
discussion on this it does not mean
 
05:51:42.070 --> 05:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to vote on it we probably
 
05:51:43.430 --> 05:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
won't but it does mean we are going to
 
05:51:49.990 --> 05:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:51.750 --> 05:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
what are we having discuss it
 
05:51:54.070 --> 05:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative weber could you approach
 
05:51:56.948 --> 05:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:01.190 --> 05:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
no representative approach come up here
 
05:52:03.270 --> 05:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
you the only representative webber in
 
05:52:10.788 --> 05:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:34.150 --> 05:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:34.160 --> 05:52:39.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:52:39.190 --> 05:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:41.590 --> 05:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
this is an executive session therefore
 
05:52:43.590 --> 05:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
it is legal
 
05:52:47.270 --> 05:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
and um we can talk for about 10 minutes
 
05:52:49.830 --> 05:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
on this if everybody is relatively quiet
 
05:52:51.830 --> 05:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
and representative knurk
 
05:52:53.990 --> 05:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
kick us off thank you i actually don't
 
05:52:55.590 --> 05:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
want to make a motion yet but i do want
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
to no we're not proceeding necessarily
 
05:53:01.030 --> 05:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
yes that's fine the point is
 
05:53:02.470 --> 05:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know i want people to understand
 
05:53:05.830 --> 05:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
that i do have my own personal feeling i
 
05:53:07.430 --> 05:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
have to separate that from speaking for
 
05:53:10.470 --> 05:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
the board but we had a really difficult
 
05:53:12.230 --> 05:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
discussion on this because of opening
 
05:53:14.310 --> 05:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
floodgates talking about trying to start
 
05:53:16.708 --> 05:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
redefining the pain issue and the
 
05:53:18.470 --> 05:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
difficulties that would be
 
05:53:20.470 --> 05:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
um what representative sent me some more
 
05:53:21.990 --> 05:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
information and i promised her i would
 
05:53:24.310 --> 05:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
convey this to the committee because i
 
05:53:26.548 --> 05:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
want to have her have a fair shake or
 
05:53:28.070 --> 05:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
her constituent
 
05:53:29.590 --> 05:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
she is concerned again about the stigma
 
05:53:32.150 --> 05:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
of chronic pain and not meaning just the
 
05:53:34.788 --> 05:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
stigma as people think of her but
 
05:53:37.270 --> 05:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
access to things such as life insurance
 
05:53:39.110 --> 05:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
disability insurance the reason she says
 
05:53:41.110 --> 05:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
that is i made a comment that it is
 
05:53:42.948 --> 05:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
confidential within
 
05:53:45.270 --> 05:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
tcmob that is correct however the
 
05:53:47.430 --> 05:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
provider will probably document
 
05:53:50.470 --> 05:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
today i filled out a certification for
 
05:53:53.670 --> 05:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis for so and so on
 
05:53:56.548 --> 05:53:56.558 align:start position:0%
the basis of their migraine headaches
 
05:53:59.030 --> 05:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
using the diagnosis of chronic pain they
 
05:54:00.628 --> 05:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
might not say that they may just say
 
05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
using their migraine headaches
 
05:54:04.470 --> 05:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
that would be in there because tc
 
05:54:06.150 --> 05:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
program might contact them and say you
 
05:54:07.590 --> 05:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
said chronic pain you said the medical
 
05:54:09.430 --> 05:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
records that confirmed that they they do
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
have the authority to do that
 
05:54:12.708 --> 05:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
the point is once it's in the medical
 
05:54:14.628 --> 05:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
record that should be protected from
 
05:54:17.270 --> 05:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
hipaa we know that for medical insurance
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh under the aca you're prohibited from
 
05:54:20.948 --> 05:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
doing medical underwriting so that will
 
05:54:22.708 --> 05:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
not make a difference there
 
05:54:24.948 --> 05:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
as she points out and she's been texting
 
05:54:26.830 --> 05:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
me nonstop since the hearing
 
05:54:29.030 --> 05:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
um you know if you get your triple a
 
05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
thing for disability or or life
 
05:54:32.070 --> 05:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
insurance or something the little fine
 
05:54:33.830 --> 05:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
print at the bottom says that they can
 
05:54:35.590 --> 05:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
seek information they'll they'll pull up
 
05:54:37.110 --> 05:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
let's say the pharmacy record see if you
 
05:54:38.868 --> 05:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
had another opioid then you had chronic
 
05:54:40.628 --> 05:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
pain but of course that's a separate
 
05:54:42.868 --> 05:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
issue that's an example she used because
 
05:54:44.150 --> 05:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about opioids here
 
05:54:45.350 --> 05:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about tc you don't get
 
05:54:47.030 --> 05:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
those at the pharmacy
 
05:54:49.830 --> 05:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
so i think this is a complex issue
 
05:54:51.750 --> 05:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
that conceivably a person could have
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
what would be viewed as a blot in their
 
05:54:56.708 --> 05:54:56.718 align:start position:0%
record that might impact other aspects
 
05:54:58.390 --> 05:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
of either
 
05:55:01.830 --> 05:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
occupation however personally
 
05:55:03.430 --> 05:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think there's a real problem when we
 
05:55:05.110 --> 05:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
get into these lists and that's exactly
 
05:55:07.110 --> 05:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
what we just went through on this one it
 
05:55:09.110 --> 05:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
is totally analogous
 
05:55:11.430 --> 05:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
that it you have the exclusionary aspect
 
05:55:14.070 --> 05:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
of it and the confusion i get our job
 
05:55:15.910 --> 05:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
and what i want to do in ccmob when i
 
05:55:17.990 --> 05:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
finally get this moving is to get out
 
05:55:20.150 --> 05:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
and get our providers educated that is
 
05:55:22.310 --> 05:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
my big job for the next couple of years
 
05:55:24.310 --> 05:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
in addition to this if i get re-elected
 
05:55:26.628 --> 05:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
you are running again please
 
05:55:29.190 --> 05:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
well luckily i'm i'm i'm appointed as an
 
05:55:31.110 --> 05:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
orthopedist so even if i don't win an
 
05:55:32.708 --> 05:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
election i still get to serve on the
 
05:55:32.718 --> 05:55:34.230 align:start position:0%
election i still get to serve on the
board

05:55:34.230 --> 05:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:55:35.670 --> 05:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i will still be here pestering you
 
05:55:36.548 --> 05:55:36.558 align:start position:0%
because i'll probably still be the
 
05:55:38.150 --> 05:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison thank you that'll be
 
05:55:40.470 --> 05:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
the chair okay in any case
 
05:55:40.480 --> 05:55:41.590 align:start position:0%
the chair okay in any case
so

05:55:41.590 --> 05:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:55:43.830 --> 05:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
personally i i'm worried about trying to
 
05:55:45.270 --> 05:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
start splitting hairs and adding more
 
05:55:46.470 --> 05:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
stuff for the very reason it's been
 
05:55:47.510 --> 05:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
05:55:50.708 --> 05:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
um i do respect the concerns that
 
05:55:52.868 --> 05:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
suzanne has and i'm wondering if anybody
 
05:55:55.750 --> 05:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
else has any experience in this room
 
05:55:57.510 --> 05:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
knowing that maybe lucy is an attorney
 
05:55:59.270 --> 05:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
might have more knowledge about this
 
05:56:01.510 --> 05:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
again medical underwriting you can't you
 
05:56:02.788 --> 05:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
can't take into account that's not a
 
05:56:04.788 --> 05:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
problem but for life and disability
 
05:56:06.708 --> 05:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
insurance can they access your medical
 
05:56:08.788 --> 05:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
records to identify that you have
 
05:56:11.430 --> 05:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
something that would cause them to
 
05:56:13.350 --> 05:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
rate you differently does anybody have
 
05:56:15.190 --> 05:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge on that represent
 
05:56:18.628 --> 05:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:20.470 --> 05:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't exactly call this knowledge
 
05:56:24.390 --> 05:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
but i do have an experience of someone
 
05:56:27.030 --> 05:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
um who i was treating
 
05:56:29.190 --> 05:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
for psychotherapy
 
05:56:29.200 --> 05:56:31.590 align:start position:0%
for psychotherapy
closer

05:56:31.590 --> 05:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
closer
 
05:56:34.070 --> 05:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
i do have the is it on now yeah i do
 
05:56:36.150 --> 05:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
have the experience of someone who i was
 
05:56:37.830 --> 05:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
in treatment with me
 
05:56:39.190 --> 05:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
having to give
 
05:56:41.670 --> 05:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
a release of information to me in order
 
05:56:41.680 --> 05:56:42.548 align:start position:0%
a release of information to me in order
to

05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:56:47.750 --> 05:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:49.510 --> 05:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else for the discussion this is
 
05:56:49.520 --> 05:56:50.390 align:start position:0%
anyone else for the discussion this is
not

05:56:50.390 --> 05:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily question time but
 
05:56:57.670 --> 05:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:03.350 --> 05:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:05.030 --> 05:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
i do understand what
 
05:57:06.948 --> 05:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for mr chairman for uh let me
 
05:57:09.990 --> 05:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
speak in regards to the underlying
 
05:57:12.070 --> 05:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
bill and the requirement for it i think
 
05:57:13.030 --> 05:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
it has
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of merit however i think it's a
 
05:57:17.110 --> 05:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
slurpee slope and therefore if we start
 
05:57:19.750 --> 05:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
getting into parsing things out
 
05:57:21.350 --> 05:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
then we may leave something out that we
 
05:57:22.788 --> 05:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been
 
05:57:24.470 --> 05:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore we run the risk of not
 
05:57:26.470 --> 05:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
being inclusive enough
 
05:57:28.470 --> 05:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
in regards to the issue of insurance i
 
05:57:29.830 --> 05:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
can't speak that i'm not an insurance
 
05:57:31.590 --> 05:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
agent i would make the assumption that
 
05:57:32.708 --> 05:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:57:33.750 --> 05:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
what you should be careful what you're
 
05:57:36.150 --> 05:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
doing consumption but when you want to
 
05:57:39.030 --> 05:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
apply for any kind of life insurance
 
05:57:40.470 --> 05:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
i believe the insurance underwriter
 
05:57:41.910 --> 05:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
probably has access to anything they
 
05:57:43.590 --> 05:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
want and if you don't want to provide it
 
05:57:44.390 --> 05:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
to them
 
05:57:46.070 --> 05:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
they can probably deny it doesn't mean
 
05:57:47.830 --> 05:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
you have to but they don't have to issue
 
05:57:49.590 --> 05:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
the policy to you that's just my logic
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
to it so at this point in time i'm
 
05:57:56.390 --> 05:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:58.310 --> 05:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
i hate to say the word but itl because i
 
05:57:59.590 --> 05:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
think at this point in time we're not
 
05:58:01.910 --> 05:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
per se an exact question mr chairman but
 
05:58:03.430 --> 05:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's kind of we are in an
 
05:58:04.868 --> 05:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
executive session and i would like to
 
05:58:08.150 --> 05:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
make a motion to itl the bill if we can
 
05:58:12.788 --> 05:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:15.670 --> 05:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
yes this is this is not an opinion about
 
05:58:18.628 --> 05:58:18.638 align:start position:0%
whether we should um add another um
 
05:58:21.190 --> 05:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
category or not but i think that when
 
05:58:23.430 --> 05:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about stigma
 
05:58:26.150 --> 05:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're assuming that we're talking about
 
05:58:28.230 --> 05:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
stigma from the point of view
 
05:58:30.548 --> 05:58:30.558 align:start position:0%
of other people looking unkindly on a
 
05:58:33.270 --> 05:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
certain diagnosis but i think stigma
 
05:58:35.910 --> 05:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
exists for the person themselves
 
05:58:39.990 --> 05:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
who might be applying for
 
05:58:41.910 --> 05:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
the use of therapeutic cannabis and i
 
05:58:43.990 --> 05:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
think specifically for chronic pain
 
05:58:46.788 --> 05:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
there are a number of illnesses that
 
05:58:51.190 --> 05:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:52.628 --> 05:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of contention about
 
05:58:56.310 --> 05:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
diagnoses like for example fibromyalgia
 
05:59:00.390 --> 05:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
and um you know there are people who
 
05:59:02.310 --> 05:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
anyway i you know
 
05:59:04.788 --> 05:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
there are people who don't believe in
 
05:59:07.190 --> 05:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
certain diagnoses and therefore people
 
05:59:09.590 --> 05:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
who have those diagnoses
 
05:59:12.150 --> 05:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
feel um
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
stigmatized so i think we have to you
 
05:59:14.400 --> 05:59:16.070 align:start position:0%
stigmatized so i think we have to you
know

05:59:16.070 --> 05:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:59:17.910 --> 05:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
have to consider that stigma might not
 
05:59:20.948 --> 05:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
be only from the external world but also
 
05:59:23.270 --> 05:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
from the internal yeah
 
05:59:25.430 --> 05:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily a reason in my
 
05:59:27.910 --> 05:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
opinion that we should go one way or the
 
05:59:29.510 --> 05:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
other but i think that's something to
 
05:59:29.520 --> 05:59:30.708 align:start position:0%
other but i think that's something to
consider

05:59:30.708 --> 05:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:59:34.868 --> 05:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
representative canuck you were asked to
 
05:59:37.350 --> 05:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
be an amendment person
 
05:59:39.270 --> 05:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
on this
 
05:59:39.280 --> 05:59:40.230 align:start position:0%
on this
um

05:59:40.230 --> 05:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:42.868 --> 05:59:42.878 align:start position:0%
are there others who wish to serve with
 
05:59:42.878 --> 05:59:45.350 align:start position:0%
are there others who wish to serve with
you

05:59:45.350 --> 05:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:47.350 --> 05:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
may i answer that or speak to that i
 
05:59:49.830 --> 05:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned you yeah yeah well i i think
 
05:59:51.190 --> 05:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
the issue is the amendment that i would
 
05:59:52.948 --> 05:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
bring forth would be simply to change it
 
05:59:54.948 --> 05:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
to the proper location in the statutory
 
05:59:56.948 --> 05:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
language that's the only job that i
 
05:59:58.628 --> 05:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
would do as far as an amendment because
 
05:59:59.910 --> 05:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to start parsing out all
 
06:00:02.230 --> 06:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
the chronic pain syndromes in fact we
 
06:00:04.708 --> 06:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
did talk about that tcmob and we decided
 
06:00:06.390 --> 06:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
we did not want to open that can of
 
06:00:08.628 --> 06:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
worms because we felt again that would
 
06:00:10.230 --> 06:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
then if the difficulty would be
 
06:00:12.708 --> 06:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
exclusionary issues again
 
06:00:15.110 --> 06:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
this is all
 
06:00:17.190 --> 06:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
because we did not have a quorum
 
06:00:19.190 --> 06:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
we we did not want to open that can and
 
06:00:22.548 --> 06:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
go down that line so you would bring it
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
in that would give us time to think
 
06:00:26.548 --> 06:00:26.558 align:start position:0%
about this okay then reopen this
 
06:00:27.990 --> 06:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
06:00:29.910 --> 06:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment would be available and if
 
06:00:32.708 --> 06:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
we decide to itl then it doesn't matter
 
06:00:34.788 --> 06:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
if we decide to go with the
 
06:00:36.070 --> 06:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
with the past we've already got the
 
06:00:37.750 --> 06:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
amendment at hand so i would be glad to
 
06:00:39.670 --> 06:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
put that in i don't really need any help
 
06:00:41.110 --> 06:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
on it because it's not a high cognitive
 
06:00:43.030 --> 06:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
job that answers my question thank you
 
06:00:44.788 --> 06:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close the executive note
 
06:00:46.868 --> 06:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close the executive session
 
06:00:52.470 --> 06:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:54.868 --> 06:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear it okay i did not hear a
 
06:00:57.030 --> 06:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
motion here so he does not have to do
 
06:00:57.040 --> 06:00:58.788 align:start position:0%
motion here so he does not have to do
that

06:00:58.788 --> 06:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:00:58.798 --> 06:01:07.990 align:start position:0%
that
because

06:01:07.990 --> 06:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:13.030 --> 06:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:14.948 --> 06:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
you need to overruled the motion sorry
 
06:01:16.948 --> 06:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
did i receive that motion did i receive
 
06:01:16.958 --> 06:01:17.590 align:start position:0%
did i receive that motion did i receive
it

06:01:17.590 --> 06:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:01:19.750 --> 06:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
it was not seconded
 
06:01:25.990 --> 06:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:29.270 --> 06:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on house bill 1455
 
06:01:31.510 --> 06:01:31.520 align:start position:0%

06:01:49.990 --> 06:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
very simply
 
06:01:53.190 --> 06:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
it isn't because we're anti-vaccine
 
06:01:55.670 --> 06:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
i got my first shot in january my second
 
06:01:57.670 --> 06:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
in february and i got my booster in
 
06:01:57.680 --> 06:01:59.030 align:start position:0%
in february and i got my booster in
december

06:01:59.030 --> 06:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
december
 
06:02:01.670 --> 06:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
i am not against the vaccine in any way
 
06:02:03.110 --> 06:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
shape or form
 
06:02:05.270 --> 06:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
what i am against
 
06:02:07.510 --> 06:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i will fight
 
06:02:10.548 --> 06:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
every single day that i am here is the
 
06:02:13.750 --> 06:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
mandate from washington dc
 
06:02:16.390 --> 06:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill does
 
06:02:18.868 --> 06:02:18.878 align:start position:0%
it does not have anything to do with
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
being against
 
06:02:21.830 --> 06:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
a vaccine
 
06:02:25.110 --> 06:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
i urge people to get vaccinated
 
06:02:27.990 --> 06:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
but i will not be blackmailed by the
 
06:02:30.470 --> 06:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
06:02:32.310 --> 06:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
06:02:34.708 --> 06:02:34.718 align:start position:0%
says we will not
 
06:02:37.190 --> 06:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
be blackmailed
 
06:02:39.110 --> 06:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
i've been fighting this
 
06:02:40.868 --> 06:02:40.878 align:start position:0%
blackmail from the federal government
 
06:02:43.830 --> 06:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
for 45 years of my life
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
on other subject matter
 
06:02:47.750 --> 06:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
and when this came down
 
06:02:49.430 --> 06:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
it was wrong
 
06:02:54.390 --> 06:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
i believe in my heart that this hurt
 
06:02:57.590 --> 06:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
the vaccines more than it helped
 
06:03:00.788 --> 06:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
so all i'm saying to this committee and
 
06:03:03.190 --> 06:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
all i'm saying to you the members
 
06:03:05.670 --> 06:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
is that this is not about the vaccine
 
06:03:07.350 --> 06:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
this is about
 
06:03:09.830 --> 06:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
i believe an unconstitutional mandate
 
06:03:12.230 --> 06:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
from washington d.c
 
06:03:14.150 --> 06:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill does
 
06:03:16.628 --> 06:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
it says we will not comply with federal
 
06:03:16.638 --> 06:03:18.628 align:start position:0%
it says we will not comply with federal
blackmail

06:03:18.628 --> 06:03:18.638 align:start position:0%
blackmail
 
06:03:21.510 --> 06:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's it will you accept questions from
 
06:03:24.470 --> 06:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
the committee mr speaker
 
06:03:27.030 --> 06:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
i will accept
 
06:03:28.628 --> 06:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
and i please don't anybody take this
 
06:03:33.590 --> 06:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:35.830 --> 06:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
and it's my job to determine that thank
 
06:03:35.840 --> 06:03:36.548 align:start position:0%
and it's my job to determine that thank
you

06:03:36.548 --> 06:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:03:39.190 --> 06:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative knurk uh thank you and
 
06:03:42.310 --> 06:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um just a
 
06:03:43.830 --> 06:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
question about the breadth of this to
 
06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
sort that issue out because obviously
 
06:03:47.750 --> 06:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
this was written a few months ago yes it
 
06:03:49.670 --> 06:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
was since the
 
06:03:52.470 --> 06:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
supreme court has upheld the cms mandate
 
06:03:52.480 --> 06:03:54.070 align:start position:0%
supreme court has upheld the cms mandate
regarding

06:03:54.070 --> 06:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
06:03:56.070 --> 06:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
funding of medicare and medicaid the
 
06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
question is is there any state role for
 
06:04:01.510 --> 06:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement of that mandate or not
 
06:04:03.830 --> 06:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
anyway and if not
 
06:04:05.670 --> 06:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
how do we deal with the fact the supreme
 
06:04:06.948 --> 06:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
court has ruled that that is
 
06:04:09.430 --> 06:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional do we need to put a carve
 
06:04:11.590 --> 06:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
out in for that specific one which could
 
06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
be a problem because of them parsing
 
06:04:15.190 --> 06:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
each thing as it happens
 
06:04:17.190 --> 06:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
or or not i just i'm trying to figure
 
06:04:19.830 --> 06:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
out if there is an applicability there
 
06:04:21.750 --> 06:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
well as as you said representative this
 
06:04:23.350 --> 06:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
was written i think
 
06:04:25.510 --> 06:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
two two and a half months ago
 
06:04:28.948 --> 06:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
and um i'm not going to sit here today
 
06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
and say that i'm inflexible
 
06:04:33.270 --> 06:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
because i that's not
 
06:04:35.910 --> 06:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
what i am i will be flexible
 
06:04:35.920 --> 06:04:36.788 align:start position:0%
what i am i will be flexible
if

06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:04:38.868 --> 06:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
some language needed to be
 
06:04:41.910 --> 06:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
changed by the committee to accommodate
 
06:04:43.830 --> 06:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances that have happened since
 
06:04:45.350 --> 06:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
this bill was written
 
06:04:49.190 --> 06:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'd be open to suggestions
 
06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
06:04:52.628 --> 06:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
question because i'm trying to figure
 
06:04:54.070 --> 06:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
out how one would achieve that though do
 
06:04:55.830 --> 06:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
you have any do you have any suggestions
 
06:04:58.070 --> 06:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
i i honestly at this point i do not
 
06:05:00.070 --> 06:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
represent thank you
 
06:05:00.080 --> 06:05:01.590 align:start position:0%
represent thank you
representative

06:05:01.590 --> 06:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:05:01.600 --> 06:05:02.868 align:start position:0%
representative
cushman

06:05:02.868 --> 06:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
cushman
 
06:05:04.868 --> 06:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
06:05:06.868 --> 06:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
speaker for taking my question
 
06:05:06.878 --> 06:05:07.750 align:start position:0%
speaker for taking my question
um

06:05:07.750 --> 06:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
mr speaker are you aware that so far
 
06:05:14.390 --> 06:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
a few other states have issued broad
 
06:05:17.590 --> 06:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate bans and so far the
 
06:05:19.190 --> 06:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
federal government has not taken any
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
action against those states and it's
 
06:05:23.430 --> 06:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
also been speculated that a
 
06:05:27.110 --> 06:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
duly enacted state law would hold more
 
06:05:33.510 --> 06:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:35.590 --> 06:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer
 
06:05:37.750 --> 06:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to i'm not going to
 
06:05:40.070 --> 06:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
attempt to comment on legal issues that
 
06:05:42.070 --> 06:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
i don't feel when i'm capable i'm
 
06:05:44.230 --> 06:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
qualified to comment on representative
 
06:05:45.990 --> 06:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
cushman a question from the chair to you
 
06:05:50.470 --> 06:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay you may ask a follow-up
 
06:05:56.948 --> 06:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh mr speaker
 
06:06:00.150 --> 06:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
um would you consider
 
06:06:03.750 --> 06:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
if there was no language that
 
06:06:06.628 --> 06:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
permitted us to have an outright ban
 
06:06:08.708 --> 06:06:08.718 align:start position:0%
but instead to make the exemption
 
06:06:11.670 --> 06:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
process easier um that way businesses
 
06:06:11.680 --> 06:06:12.548 align:start position:0%
process easier um that way businesses
could

06:06:12.548 --> 06:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:06:13.830 --> 06:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
still like
 
06:06:16.708 --> 06:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
cms uh regulated businesses could still
 
06:06:19.510 --> 06:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
issue their mandate but just have a very
 
06:06:21.590 --> 06:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
simple exemption process
 
06:06:23.190 --> 06:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
i i believe
 
06:06:25.110 --> 06:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
as you are aware representative and i'm
 
06:06:26.628 --> 06:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
aware and i think every member here is
 
06:06:28.788 --> 06:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
we have numerous bills that address that
 
06:06:31.830 --> 06:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
issue as far as the exemption goes and i
 
06:06:33.670 --> 06:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
i believe that that's the path we
 
06:06:35.990 --> 06:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
probably should go down
 
06:06:37.270 --> 06:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
we reject
 
06:06:39.510 --> 06:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
mandates but we work
 
06:06:42.150 --> 06:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
to accommodate those people that have a
 
06:06:43.670 --> 06:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason whether it be
 
06:06:45.990 --> 06:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
religious medical
 
06:06:46.000 --> 06:06:47.830 align:start position:0%
religious medical
or

06:06:47.830 --> 06:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:06:50.150 --> 06:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
actual fear of this
 
06:06:52.390 --> 06:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
this vaccine and i know there are some
 
06:06:53.910 --> 06:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
people out there that have legitimate
 
06:06:56.868 --> 06:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
fear of this vaccine
 
06:07:00.230 --> 06:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:00.240 --> 06:07:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:07:01.110 --> 06:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:03.110 --> 06:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm understanding your point about
 
06:07:06.548 --> 06:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:08.788 --> 06:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
but i think what i'm trying to get at i
 
06:07:10.948 --> 06:07:10.958 align:start position:0%
think maybe what representative knurk is
 
06:07:13.190 --> 06:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
trying to get out also
 
06:07:13.200 --> 06:07:14.310 align:start position:0%
trying to get out also
is

06:07:14.310 --> 06:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:07:19.590 --> 06:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill with respect to
 
06:07:24.310 --> 06:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:28.230 --> 06:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:31.270 --> 06:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
there is a federal mandate
 
06:07:34.948 --> 06:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
but the federal mandate has been held to
 
06:07:34.958 --> 06:07:36.310 align:start position:0%
but the federal mandate has been held to
be

06:07:36.310 --> 06:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:07:38.708 --> 06:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
federally constitutional
 
06:07:41.910 --> 06:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
because of the close relationship
 
06:07:43.750 --> 06:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
of the mandate
 
06:07:43.760 --> 06:07:45.190 align:start position:0%
of the mandate
to

06:07:45.190 --> 06:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:07:47.990 --> 06:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
the medical issues involved so
 
06:07:48.000 --> 06:07:48.788 align:start position:0%
the medical issues involved so
that

06:07:48.788 --> 06:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:07:51.190 --> 06:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding is and i'm not this
 
06:07:53.430 --> 06:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
kind of an attorney so and i'm not an
 
06:07:55.190 --> 06:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
attorney at all at this point in my life
 
06:07:55.200 --> 06:07:56.150 align:start position:0%
attorney at all at this point in my life
but

06:07:56.150 --> 06:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:07:56.160 --> 06:07:57.270 align:start position:0%
but
uh

06:07:57.270 --> 06:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:08:00.150 --> 06:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
the the federal the u.s supreme court
 
06:08:02.628 --> 06:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
has said that the cmc
 
06:08:05.990 --> 06:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
mandate is constitutional
 
06:08:08.788 --> 06:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
it has also said that broader mandates
 
06:08:12.070 --> 06:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
are not have have exceeded the authority
 
06:08:16.708 --> 06:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:16.718 --> 06:08:18.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:08:18.230 --> 06:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:08:23.270 --> 06:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:24.948 --> 06:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
when when you started talking about
 
06:08:27.190 --> 06:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
exemptions i wasn't i was thinking about
 
06:08:30.470 --> 06:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
the exemptions for
 
06:08:32.310 --> 06:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
certain mandates as opposed to the
 
06:08:34.470 --> 06:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
exemptions for certain particular
 
06:08:37.670 --> 06:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
conditions or or religious objections or
 
06:08:39.110 --> 06:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
06:08:39.120 --> 06:08:40.628 align:start position:0%
things like that
if

06:08:40.628 --> 06:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:08:44.070 --> 06:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
would you object to a carve out for
 
06:08:48.150 --> 06:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:48.160 --> 06:08:49.110 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:08:49.110 --> 06:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:08:49.120 --> 06:08:50.788 align:start position:0%
uh
say

06:08:50.788 --> 06:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:08:53.030 --> 06:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
mandates coming from the federal
 
06:08:55.110 --> 06:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
government that have held to be been
 
06:08:57.190 --> 06:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
held to be constitutional under the us
 
06:08:57.200 --> 06:08:59.910 align:start position:0%
held to be constitutional under the us
constitution

06:08:59.910 --> 06:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
06:09:02.390 --> 06:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
the opinion of the supreme court
 
06:09:05.190 --> 06:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
i i i haven't actually read it i've
 
06:09:07.190 --> 06:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
heard of it and i've written i've read
 
06:09:08.830 --> 06:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
about it
 
06:09:12.230 --> 06:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
um frankly uh representative
 
06:09:13.990 --> 06:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
i reject
 
06:09:16.470 --> 06:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
mandates period
 
06:09:19.270 --> 06:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
i i i believe that it's a form of
 
06:09:20.948 --> 06:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
federal blackmail
 
06:09:23.670 --> 06:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
and i will i will not go along with them
 
06:09:26.310 --> 06:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
whatsoever that's not to say that i am
 
06:09:26.320 --> 06:09:27.590 align:start position:0%
whatsoever that's not to say that i am
against

06:09:27.590 --> 06:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
against
 
06:09:30.230 --> 06:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
a business
 
06:09:30.240 --> 06:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
a business
or

06:09:31.110 --> 06:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:09:31.120 --> 06:09:31.830 align:start position:0%
or
a

06:09:31.830 --> 06:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:09:34.788 --> 06:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
health care facility
 
06:09:36.390 --> 06:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
06:09:38.150 --> 06:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
they believe that they have the right to
 
06:09:39.670 --> 06:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
have a mandate
 
06:09:42.150 --> 06:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
and i probably wouldn't disagree with
 
06:09:44.470 --> 06:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
that if it was done on an individual
 
06:09:46.070 --> 06:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
business basis
 
06:09:47.750 --> 06:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
but for the federal government to tell
 
06:09:49.670 --> 06:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
me that we have to do it and it has to
 
06:09:52.948 --> 06:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
be mandated i reject that
 
06:09:54.310 --> 06:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and that's
 
06:09:57.590 --> 06:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
why and that's why i i say that
 
06:10:00.470 --> 06:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
i would also i also support the carve
 
06:10:00.480 --> 06:10:01.270 align:start position:0%
i would also i also support the carve
outs

06:10:01.270 --> 06:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
outs
 
06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
for you know any employee that is
 
06:10:05.670 --> 06:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
working for that
 
06:10:08.548 --> 06:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
particular business or institution that
 
06:10:10.070 --> 06:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
has a um
 
06:10:11.910 --> 06:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
a some type of a mandate
 
06:10:13.990 --> 06:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm against mandates
 
06:10:15.670 --> 06:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm against the state mandating
 
06:10:17.350 --> 06:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
against mandates and i made that
 
06:10:19.590 --> 06:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear i'm against federal
 
06:10:21.030 --> 06:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
mandates and i'm against the state
 
06:10:21.040 --> 06:10:22.548 align:start position:0%
mandates and i'm against the state
mandates

06:10:22.548 --> 06:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
06:10:24.150 --> 06:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification mr
 
06:10:24.160 --> 06:10:25.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification mr
speaker

06:10:25.350 --> 06:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
06:10:28.470 --> 06:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
06:10:32.390 --> 06:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman welcome mr speaker
 
06:10:33.990 --> 06:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
please forgive me i i have a number of
 
06:10:35.670 --> 06:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
questions i'm going to bundle them all
 
06:10:37.990 --> 06:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
as one to make this bad
 
06:10:40.390 --> 06:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
um i i've heard
 
06:10:43.030 --> 06:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
you say that you are not a lawyer
 
06:10:45.670 --> 06:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
i've heard our lawyer say that this is
 
06:10:48.548 --> 06:10:48.558 align:start position:0%
not her area i've heard from one nurse
 
06:10:49.990 --> 06:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
and a physician
 
06:10:52.390 --> 06:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking for some legal expertise
 
06:10:54.548 --> 06:10:54.558 align:start position:0%
here which i don't have
 
06:10:57.190 --> 06:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
i have pink cards and i'm not afraid to
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
use them
 
06:11:00.150 --> 06:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
and i will get to them
 
06:11:00.160 --> 06:11:00.948 align:start position:0%
and i will get to them
and

06:11:00.948 --> 06:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:11:00.958 --> 06:11:01.830 align:start position:0%
and
so

06:11:01.830 --> 06:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:11:04.390 --> 06:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
is it not possible
 
06:11:04.400 --> 06:11:05.750 align:start position:0%
is it not possible
that

06:11:05.750 --> 06:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:11:08.310 --> 06:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
people acting under this draft
 
06:11:11.110 --> 06:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
legislation could be accused by the
 
06:11:13.030 --> 06:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
federal government of
 
06:11:15.510 --> 06:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
obstruction of justice
 
06:11:15.520 --> 06:11:18.110 align:start position:0%
obstruction of justice
sedition

06:11:18.110 --> 06:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
sedition
 
06:11:20.948 --> 06:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional acts vis-a-vis federal
 
06:11:23.590 --> 06:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
versus state jurisdiction i don't know
 
06:11:25.910 --> 06:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
that i'm asking and
 
06:11:28.948 --> 06:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
given that these are legal issues rather
 
06:11:31.830 --> 06:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
than health related issues why is it
 
06:11:37.830 --> 06:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:41.270 --> 06:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
this bill was put before this committee
 
06:11:43.110 --> 06:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
because of the statutes that it was
 
06:11:45.430 --> 06:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
under and that's how we in
 
06:11:48.708 --> 06:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
in most cases when we're unsure of where
 
06:11:50.788 --> 06:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
a bill goes and i've done this numerous
 
06:11:53.750 --> 06:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
times is that we go to the statue we
 
06:11:55.350 --> 06:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
look at the statue
 
06:11:58.390 --> 06:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
and whatever that statue
 
06:12:00.390 --> 06:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
depicts as to what part of the bar it's
 
06:12:02.470 --> 06:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
under is where we end up sending the
 
06:12:05.110 --> 06:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
bill finally
 
06:12:06.548 --> 06:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
i mean we look at
 
06:12:07.990 --> 06:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know we look at
 
06:12:09.590 --> 06:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
house rules
 
06:12:11.830 --> 06:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
we look at statutes we look at the
 
06:12:13.750 --> 06:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations i think you had did this
 
06:12:15.270 --> 06:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative webber we look at the
 
06:12:17.990 --> 06:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations from uh ann fitzgerald
 
06:12:20.150 --> 06:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
and her group and we take all that into
 
06:12:22.548 --> 06:12:22.558 align:start position:0%
consideration and that's how we do it
 
06:12:25.110 --> 06:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
are we perfect by no means
 
06:12:25.120 --> 06:12:25.910 align:start position:0%
are we perfect by no means
but

06:12:25.910 --> 06:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:12:29.190 --> 06:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
we try and do the best we can
 
06:12:31.110 --> 06:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:12:36.150 --> 06:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
mr speaker are you at all concerned that
 
06:12:38.868 --> 06:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire medical providers
 
06:12:41.030 --> 06:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
won't follow the requirements by
 
06:12:43.830 --> 06:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
medicaid and medicare
 
06:12:43.840 --> 06:12:45.910 align:start position:0%
medicaid and medicare
because

06:12:45.910 --> 06:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:12:47.510 --> 06:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
well personally i don't think they're
 
06:12:49.910 --> 06:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
going to be afraid they won't break the
 
06:12:52.628 --> 06:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
rules because they want to be paid so is
 
06:12:54.628 --> 06:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
that really a concern
 
06:12:58.230 --> 06:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:02.708 --> 06:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:05.270 --> 06:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
mr speaker the supreme court ruling on
 
06:13:08.390 --> 06:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
the osha that was cited cited the lack
 
06:13:10.628 --> 06:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
of congressional authority
 
06:13:13.030 --> 06:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh does this bill address future actions
 
06:13:14.628 --> 06:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
by the federal government or just the
 
06:13:17.030 --> 06:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
ones in place presently um
 
06:13:19.670 --> 06:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
well again as as as we have stated it
 
06:13:21.590 --> 06:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
was written about two two and a half
 
06:13:24.628 --> 06:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
months ago so i i
 
06:13:26.548 --> 06:13:26.558 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the expertise in this committee
 
06:13:28.390 --> 06:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
has a chance to look at that and if it
 
06:13:31.350 --> 06:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
has to be amended it could be done thank
 
06:13:37.190 --> 06:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:38.548 --> 06:13:38.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
06:13:40.628 --> 06:13:40.638 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you mr speaker for
 
06:13:42.788 --> 06:13:42.798 align:start position:0%
taking another question and i
 
06:13:42.798 --> 06:13:44.230 align:start position:0%
taking another question and i
uh

06:13:44.230 --> 06:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:13:46.470 --> 06:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
honestly don't know the answer to this
 
06:13:46.480 --> 06:13:47.510 align:start position:0%
honestly don't know the answer to this
but

06:13:47.510 --> 06:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:13:50.070 --> 06:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
is there any possible way that you as
 
06:13:52.548 --> 06:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
speaker can get this bill out of health
 
06:13:55.110 --> 06:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
and human services because it does not
 
06:13:58.150 --> 06:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
deal at all with health policy
 
06:14:01.830 --> 06:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
and into judiciary or even state and
 
06:14:01.840 --> 06:14:02.830 align:start position:0%
and into judiciary or even state and
federal

06:14:02.830 --> 06:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
federal
 
06:14:05.510 --> 06:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
regulation but but i think most likely
 
06:14:08.708 --> 06:14:08.718 align:start position:0%
judiciary which is where they might have
 
06:14:11.670 --> 06:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
more expertise in the subject matter
 
06:14:13.990 --> 06:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
i know that vacation has to happen
 
06:14:14.000 --> 06:14:15.510 align:start position:0%
i know that vacation has to happen
before

06:14:15.510 --> 06:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
before
 
06:14:17.590 --> 06:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
a bill is assigned to committee and set
 
06:14:19.430 --> 06:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
for hearing but is there any other
 
06:14:21.670 --> 06:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
process by which we could get it
 
06:14:23.830 --> 06:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
over to judiciary well when we when we
 
06:14:26.070 --> 06:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
meet to uh send the bills to a second
 
06:14:26.080 --> 06:14:27.750 align:start position:0%
meet to uh send the bills to a second
committee

06:14:27.750 --> 06:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:14:30.390 --> 06:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
we could at that point
 
06:14:33.110 --> 06:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
add this bill to that if we if we if we
 
06:14:35.030 --> 06:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
felt it necessary
 
06:14:36.948 --> 06:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
so i i mean i know that's happened many
 
06:14:38.788 --> 06:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
many times in the past the bill isn't
 
06:14:40.788 --> 06:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
initially sent to a second committee but
 
06:14:42.070 --> 06:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
you know once it's gone through the
 
06:14:43.830 --> 06:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
committee process of whatever committee
 
06:14:44.708 --> 06:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
it's in
 
06:14:46.708 --> 06:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
it has gone whether it be finance ways
 
06:14:48.708 --> 06:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
and means or another committee so the
 
06:14:50.788 --> 06:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
answer your question is yes it could be
 
06:14:52.788 --> 06:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
sent to another committee
 
06:14:52.798 --> 06:14:54.310 align:start position:0%
sent to another committee
follow-up

06:14:54.310 --> 06:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:14:55.510 --> 06:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
06:14:57.750 --> 06:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
if but if it were to be sent to a second
 
06:14:59.510 --> 06:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee it would have to be we would
 
06:15:02.470 --> 06:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
have to have it out of here by february
 
06:15:04.070 --> 06:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
8th i think
 
06:15:05.670 --> 06:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
i know that's not the actual date but
 
06:15:07.350 --> 06:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
it's the last date that we're meeting
 
06:15:10.230 --> 06:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
yeah the though i i our our deadline is
 
06:15:12.150 --> 06:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
attend thank you sir
 
06:15:12.160 --> 06:15:14.070 align:start position:0%
attend thank you sir
representative

06:15:14.070 --> 06:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:15:15.510 --> 06:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much and thank you
 
06:15:17.510 --> 06:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
again mr speaker for taking another
 
06:15:19.830 --> 06:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
question i guess i'm i'm still a little
 
06:15:22.070 --> 06:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
confused because we kept talking about
 
06:15:24.708 --> 06:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
not wanting the mandates to apply but
 
06:15:26.310 --> 06:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
that's really not the point of this bill
 
06:15:27.590 --> 06:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
actually the point of this bill is that
 
06:15:29.910 --> 06:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
we're not that the state will not engage
 
06:15:32.548 --> 06:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
in helping with enforcement and i think
 
06:15:34.230 --> 06:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
relative to what representative gay's
 
06:15:36.628 --> 06:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
question is i presume in the cms the
 
06:15:38.070 --> 06:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement would come from the federal
 
06:15:39.190 --> 06:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
government anyway they don't have to
 
06:15:41.110 --> 06:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
check with the state to see if they're a
 
06:15:42.628 --> 06:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
provider they would just say hey we're
 
06:15:43.830 --> 06:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
not going to pay you
 
06:15:46.708 --> 06:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
so i would in a sense i'm not sure that
 
06:15:48.548 --> 06:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
we necessarily need to carve out for
 
06:15:50.708 --> 06:15:50.718 align:start position:0%
that because the feds would already be
 
06:15:52.070 --> 06:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
doing their own enforcement that's why i
 
06:15:53.030 --> 06:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
was wondering
 
06:15:55.430 --> 06:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
do we have a role actually in enforcing
 
06:16:00.070 --> 06:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:01.830 --> 06:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is why i put to go forward
 
06:16:04.150 --> 06:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative because i
 
06:16:04.160 --> 06:16:05.670 align:start position:0%
representative because i
absolutely

06:16:05.670 --> 06:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
06:16:08.868 --> 06:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
do not want the state of new hampshire
 
06:16:11.190 --> 06:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
forcing what i consider illegal federal
 
06:16:11.200 --> 06:16:15.670 align:start position:0%
forcing what i consider illegal federal
mandates

06:16:15.670 --> 06:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:16.548 --> 06:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:16:19.030 --> 06:16:19.040 align:start position:0%

06:16:36.150 --> 06:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes kate horgan from the
 
06:16:38.470 --> 06:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
nash the new hampshire
 
06:16:40.070 --> 06:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
what a slip huh
 
06:16:42.628 --> 06:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
not national associate the new hampshire
 
06:16:45.510 --> 06:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
association of counties
 
06:16:47.830 --> 06:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
who has 20 copies we'll make some more
 
06:16:50.868 --> 06:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
we have 21 of us but we have a machine
 
06:16:53.190 --> 06:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
so pass them around and
 
06:16:55.270 --> 06:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
they are on their way around
 
06:16:57.670 --> 06:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh thank you very much
 
06:16:59.270 --> 06:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is kate
 
06:17:01.350 --> 06:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
horgan i'm the executive director of the
 
06:17:03.590 --> 06:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association of counties
 
06:17:05.510 --> 06:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
which represents all of your appointed
 
06:17:07.510 --> 06:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
and elected officials in county
 
06:17:07.520 --> 06:17:08.708 align:start position:0%
and elected officials in county
government

06:17:08.708 --> 06:17:08.718 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:17:10.548 --> 06:17:10.558 align:start position:0%
so in this case in particular i'm
 
06:17:12.230 --> 06:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
bringing forward the concerns of your
 
06:17:14.788 --> 06:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
county nursing home administrators
 
06:17:17.430 --> 06:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this bill we see that
 
06:17:20.470 --> 06:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
this bill sets us up to be in conflict
 
06:17:24.310 --> 06:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
with the federal statutes and that could
 
06:17:26.628 --> 06:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
create conflicting policies
 
06:17:26.638 --> 06:17:27.750 align:start position:0%
create conflicting policies
for

06:17:27.750 --> 06:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:17:30.070 --> 06:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
our county nursing homes so we think
 
06:17:32.948 --> 06:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
that it is important that each county be
 
06:17:35.110 --> 06:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
able to set their own
 
06:17:38.070 --> 06:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
policies around the coveted vaccine
 
06:17:40.070 --> 06:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
some counties have already done that
 
06:17:41.830 --> 06:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
rockingham and grafton
 
06:17:44.150 --> 06:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
and merrimack did set
 
06:17:46.548 --> 06:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine policies but that was not
 
06:17:48.310 --> 06:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
something that say belknap or
 
06:17:50.548 --> 06:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
hillsborough wanted to presume
 
06:17:53.030 --> 06:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
to enforce so we need to
 
06:17:54.150 --> 06:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that counties have the
 
06:17:56.070 --> 06:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility to enforce what works for
 
06:17:58.390 --> 06:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
their counties i'm happy to take any
 
06:18:00.830 --> 06:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
questions mr chairman representative
 
06:18:03.270 --> 06:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
shapiro yes thank you mr chairman and
 
06:18:04.948 --> 06:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this question
 
06:18:07.830 --> 06:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
excuse my ignorance on this but
 
06:18:10.150 --> 06:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
um the bill as written states the state
 
06:18:11.750 --> 06:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
shall not engage
 
06:18:13.670 --> 06:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera et cetera
 
06:18:16.310 --> 06:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
so would the counties be considered a
 
06:18:18.230 --> 06:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
subsection of the state
 
06:18:19.990 --> 06:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
i would argue yes we are a political
 
06:18:22.390 --> 06:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
subdivision of the state i would also
 
06:18:25.110 --> 06:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
say that state survey
 
06:18:28.830 --> 06:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
is connected to our medicaid
 
06:18:31.270 --> 06:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh procedures and making sure that we
 
06:18:33.350 --> 06:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
qualify for medicaid so i'm not sure how
 
06:18:36.230 --> 06:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
that would resolve itself if this bill
 
06:18:38.948 --> 06:18:38.958 align:start position:0%
were put into place thank you very much
 
06:18:41.270 --> 06:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
06:18:42.788 --> 06:18:42.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:18:45.910 --> 06:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so as far as this
 
06:18:47.670 --> 06:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
bill goes i understand that the county
 
06:18:50.390 --> 06:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
is saying they want to set their own
 
06:18:50.400 --> 06:18:51.350 align:start position:0%
is saying they want to set their own
um

06:18:51.350 --> 06:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:54.150 --> 06:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know policies for vaccination and
 
06:18:56.230 --> 06:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that such policies
 
06:18:57.830 --> 06:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
have resulted in
 
06:19:01.350 --> 06:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
many health care workers leaving
 
06:19:03.110 --> 06:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
employers who required the vaccine
 
06:19:06.788 --> 06:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
before the cms mandate came down and
 
06:19:08.310 --> 06:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
in the interest of
 
06:19:09.190 --> 06:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:19:10.868 --> 06:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
ensuring we have enough people for our
 
06:19:13.350 --> 06:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
workforce it's important to
 
06:19:14.548 --> 06:19:14.558 align:start position:0%
refer back to the new hampshire
 
06:19:16.708 --> 06:19:16.718 align:start position:0%
constitution are you aware that the new
 
06:19:18.788 --> 06:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution gives the
 
06:19:20.868 --> 06:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
legislature the supreme legislative
 
06:19:22.390 --> 06:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
authority in new hampshire and not the
 
06:19:24.868 --> 06:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
counties i would say thank you for the
 
06:19:26.390 --> 06:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
question representative and i do
 
06:19:28.390 --> 06:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
understand that i will say the comments
 
06:19:31.510 --> 06:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
that you made about losing staff has not
 
06:19:33.270 --> 06:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
been the experience of the counties that
 
06:19:36.070 --> 06:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
have put vaccination policies in it has
 
06:19:36.080 --> 06:19:36.948 align:start position:0%
have put vaccination policies in it has
been

06:19:36.948 --> 06:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:19:39.590 --> 06:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
less than 10 members of the staff that
 
06:19:41.830 --> 06:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
we have lost that we weren't able to
 
06:19:44.070 --> 06:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
come up with some sort of accommodation
 
06:19:45.670 --> 06:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
around the current exemptions that are
 
06:19:45.680 --> 06:19:46.708 align:start position:0%
around the current exemptions that are
allowed

06:19:46.708 --> 06:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
06:19:46.718 --> 06:19:48.548 align:start position:0%
allowed
follow-up

06:19:48.548 --> 06:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:19:50.708 --> 06:19:50.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um what you may not
 
06:19:53.510 --> 06:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
be aware of are are you aware that i
 
06:19:56.468 --> 06:19:56.478 align:start position:0%
know that merrimack county has a
 
06:19:59.510 --> 06:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
significant shortage all the time uh
 
06:20:01.750 --> 06:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
being an agency nurse and i see that
 
06:20:04.070 --> 06:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
you're constantly posting shifts that
 
06:20:05.590 --> 06:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
don't get covered
 
06:20:07.430 --> 06:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
so i would argue that you still have a
 
06:20:09.990 --> 06:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
shortage and had your policy not been in
 
06:20:12.628 --> 06:20:12.638 align:start position:0%
place many nurses who work for agencies
 
06:20:14.788 --> 06:20:14.798 align:start position:0%
would be coming and filling that need
 
06:20:15.750 --> 06:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:20:17.430 --> 06:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative i would say we had a
 
06:20:19.350 --> 06:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
shortage before the vaccine policies
 
06:20:22.468 --> 06:20:22.478 align:start position:0%
were in place
 
06:20:24.390 --> 06:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else with a question i thought i
 
06:20:26.788 --> 06:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
saw a few hands did i see your hand i
 
06:20:29.670 --> 06:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
see part of your hand representative i
 
06:20:31.990 --> 06:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
see now all of it you may ask all your
 
06:20:32.000 --> 06:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
see now all of it you may ask all your
question

06:20:33.590 --> 06:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:20:35.350 --> 06:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:20:36.628 --> 06:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
06:20:37.910 --> 06:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
 
06:20:40.150 --> 06:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
look at this bill and i heard before
 
06:20:43.830 --> 06:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
that it would not apply to a business
 
06:20:45.510 --> 06:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
and i think of a nursing home is really
 
06:20:47.030 --> 06:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
being a business
 
06:20:48.788 --> 06:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to figure out
 
06:20:50.708 --> 06:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
dice dices through here
 
06:20:50.718 --> 06:20:52.390 align:start position:0%
dice dices through here
is

06:20:52.390 --> 06:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:20:56.390 --> 06:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:58.708 --> 06:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
when we talk about a government business
 
06:21:00.628 --> 06:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
versus a private business we're looking
 
06:21:00.638 --> 06:21:02.150 align:start position:0%
versus a private business we're looking
at

06:21:02.150 --> 06:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:21:02.160 --> 06:21:03.270 align:start position:0%
at
basically

06:21:03.270 --> 06:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
basically
 
06:21:04.628 --> 06:21:04.638 align:start position:0%
saying that if you're a business owned
 
06:21:06.150 --> 06:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
by the government you can't do it but if
 
06:21:07.350 --> 06:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
you're in a business owned by private
 
06:21:08.788 --> 06:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
you can
 
06:21:09.910 --> 06:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:21:11.910 --> 06:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative merchant i'm not sure i'm
 
06:21:14.390 --> 06:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
the right person to answer that question
 
06:21:16.230 --> 06:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
but someone coming behind me probably
 
06:21:21.510 --> 06:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:23.270 --> 06:21:23.280 align:start position:0%

will all right

06:21:28.868 --> 06:21:28.878 align:start position:0%

hospitals the new hampshire hospital
 
06:22:03.750 --> 06:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
association has concerns about h.b 1455
 
06:22:05.110 --> 06:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
which would seek to prevent state
 
06:22:06.468 --> 06:22:06.478 align:start position:0%
government from
 
06:22:08.868 --> 06:22:08.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement of federal vaccine mandates
 
06:22:11.110 --> 06:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
as i believe many if not all of you know
 
06:22:12.628 --> 06:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hospital association
 
06:22:14.150 --> 06:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
and its member hospitals announced in
 
06:22:16.948 --> 06:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
august of last year prior to the biden
 
06:22:19.590 --> 06:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
administration's vaccine announcements
 
06:22:22.230 --> 06:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
in september a consensus statement in
 
06:22:24.310 --> 06:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
support of requirements of our health
 
06:22:26.150 --> 06:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
care workforce to be vaccinated against
 
06:22:28.390 --> 06:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
coba 19 in order to protect the health
 
06:22:30.628 --> 06:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
and safety of our patients our staff and
 
06:22:32.628 --> 06:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
our communities hospitals have announced
 
06:22:34.948 --> 06:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
their own individual policies um and
 
06:22:36.708 --> 06:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
have been implementing them with robust
 
06:22:38.230 --> 06:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
education for their staff about the
 
06:22:40.628 --> 06:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
importance uh benefits of the vaccine in
 
06:22:42.390 --> 06:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
doing so hospitals have sought to be
 
06:22:44.468 --> 06:22:44.478 align:start position:0%
flexible and have complied with all
 
06:22:46.310 --> 06:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
relevant state and federal guidelines
 
06:22:48.468 --> 06:22:48.478 align:start position:0%
including offering medical and religious
 
06:22:48.478 --> 06:22:49.750 align:start position:0%
including offering medical and religious
exemptions

06:22:49.750 --> 06:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
06:22:53.510 --> 06:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
as presented we read hb 1455 to not
 
06:22:55.190 --> 06:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
interfere with the ability of private
 
06:22:56.628 --> 06:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
employers including hospitals from
 
06:22:58.548 --> 06:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
making decisions about what health and
 
06:23:00.708 --> 06:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
safety protocols are important and
 
06:23:01.910 --> 06:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate for their employees
 
06:23:04.230 --> 06:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
customers patients and organizations as
 
06:23:05.590 --> 06:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
has been said the u.s supreme court
 
06:23:07.510 --> 06:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
recently found that the federal vaccine
 
06:23:09.350 --> 06:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
mandate requirement for healthcare
 
06:23:10.390 --> 06:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
facilities that participate in the
 
06:23:11.830 --> 06:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid program is
 
06:23:14.070 --> 06:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional and can proceed
 
06:23:15.590 --> 06:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
even though new hampshire hospitals have
 
06:23:17.670 --> 06:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
already begun to implement coba 19
 
06:23:19.750 --> 06:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirement policies they must
 
06:23:22.830 --> 06:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
comply with the federal government's
 
06:23:25.270 --> 06:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
rules hospitals that participate in the
 
06:23:27.350 --> 06:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid program must be
 
06:23:29.910 --> 06:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
certified to do so many hospitals in new
 
06:23:31.750 --> 06:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire receive accreditation from
 
06:23:33.590 --> 06:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
private organizations such as the joint
 
06:23:34.948 --> 06:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
commission on accreditation of health
 
06:23:38.310 --> 06:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
care organizations dnv and others
 
06:23:40.868 --> 06:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
but others do not and in fact all of new
 
06:23:42.628 --> 06:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire's rural critical access
 
06:23:44.868 --> 06:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
hospitals all 13 of them receive their
 
06:23:46.390 --> 06:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
certification through the new hampshire
 
06:23:47.670 --> 06:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
department health and human services
 
06:23:50.150 --> 06:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
bureau of licensing and certification so
 
06:23:54.468 --> 06:23:54.478 align:start position:0%
how would hb 1455 affect the ability of
 
06:23:55.590 --> 06:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
the bureau of licensing and
 
06:23:57.350 --> 06:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
certification to conduct their review
 
06:23:58.628 --> 06:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
and certification new hampshire's
 
06:23:59.830 --> 06:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals for
 
06:24:01.750 --> 06:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining eligibility in the medicare
 
06:24:03.910 --> 06:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
and medicaid programs participation in
 
06:24:05.350 --> 06:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
those programs is essential to the
 
06:24:07.030 --> 06:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
mission of our hospitals and to serving
 
06:24:09.190 --> 06:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
all in our communities it would appear
 
06:24:11.990 --> 06:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
that hb1455 could place added costs and
 
06:24:13.510 --> 06:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
burdens on our small rural critical
 
06:24:15.350 --> 06:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
access hospitals if they were no longer
 
06:24:16.948 --> 06:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
able to rely on certification through
 
06:24:18.230 --> 06:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
the bureau of licensing and
 
06:24:20.628 --> 06:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
certification again we appreciate that
 
06:24:23.270 --> 06:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
hb 1455 would not interfere with the
 
06:24:25.030 --> 06:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
ability of private employers including
 
06:24:27.030 --> 06:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals for making decisions about
 
06:24:29.030 --> 06:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
what health and safety protocols are
 
06:24:30.230 --> 06:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate for their employees
 
06:24:32.230 --> 06:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
customers patients and organizations but
 
06:24:33.430 --> 06:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
we do have concerns about the
 
06:24:34.948 --> 06:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
implications for critical access
 
06:24:36.708 --> 06:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
hospitals thank you for the opportunity
 
06:24:38.548 --> 06:24:38.558 align:start position:0%
to offer our comments on this bill be
 
06:24:39.910 --> 06:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
happy to respond to questions that you
 
06:24:42.788 --> 06:24:42.798 align:start position:0%
might have representative shapiro
 
06:24:44.390 --> 06:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:24:46.830 --> 06:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
06:24:49.990 --> 06:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
um you say that
 
06:24:53.670 --> 06:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
some new hampshire hospitals are
 
06:24:56.070 --> 06:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
licensed by the department of
 
06:24:58.230 --> 06:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
health and human services is part of
 
06:25:00.830 --> 06:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
that licensing process to
 
06:25:00.840 --> 06:25:02.708 align:start position:0%
that licensing process to
um

06:25:02.708 --> 06:25:02.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:05.270 --> 06:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
measure compliance with federal laws um
 
06:25:07.430 --> 06:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
it is to ensure compliance with federal
 
06:25:09.110 --> 06:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations so they would be
 
06:25:11.750 --> 06:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
required to ask as they are now if they
 
06:25:13.990 --> 06:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
were complying with medicare
 
06:25:14.830 --> 06:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
rules and
 
06:25:16.708 --> 06:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
regulations would that be out of sync
 
06:25:18.070 --> 06:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
06:25:20.070 --> 06:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
it would appear to be yes thank you very
 
06:25:22.868 --> 06:25:22.878 align:start position:0%

a statement that was issued by the new
 
06:25:32.070 --> 06:25:32.080 align:start position:0%

06:25:34.548 --> 06:25:34.558 align:start position:0%

okay so you're aware a blog post is not
 
06:25:53.670 --> 06:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
a study um it was that is how they
 
06:25:55.510 --> 06:25:55.520 align:start position:0%

done

06:25:56.708 --> 06:25:56.718 align:start position:0%

06:26:00.070 --> 06:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome thank you
 
06:26:02.948 --> 06:26:02.958 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:26:04.070 --> 06:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:26:06.150 --> 06:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh are you concerned that any of the
 
06:26:07.830 --> 06:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals i have asked this question
 
06:26:10.310 --> 06:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
before are you concerned that any of the
 
06:26:13.350 --> 06:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state or providers
 
06:26:16.230 --> 06:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
general providers will be at risk for
 
06:26:18.468 --> 06:26:18.478 align:start position:0%
not following the mandate from the
 
06:26:19.910 --> 06:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
06:26:22.230 --> 06:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
because they
 
06:26:24.788 --> 06:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
because they already depend
 
06:26:28.390 --> 06:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
on financial repayment by medicare and
 
06:26:31.030 --> 06:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid as i just as i just noted and i
 
06:26:32.708 --> 06:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um i think
 
06:26:35.830 --> 06:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
the the real question becomes for those
 
06:26:37.270 --> 06:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
facilities that receive their
 
06:26:40.150 --> 06:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
certification to be a to be able to
 
06:26:41.750 --> 06:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
participate in the medicare and medicaid
 
06:26:43.670 --> 06:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
program they rely on state survey and
 
06:26:45.590 --> 06:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
certification so if they can't rely on
 
06:26:47.910 --> 06:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
the state to to do that they will then
 
06:26:50.150 --> 06:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
have to find some other alternative
 
06:26:52.548 --> 06:26:52.558 align:start position:0%
generally a much more costly alternative
 
06:26:54.230 --> 06:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
to receive that certification so that
 
06:26:55.590 --> 06:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
they could continue to participate in
 
06:26:58.948 --> 06:26:58.958 align:start position:0%
the medicare and medicaid programs
 
06:27:02.150 --> 06:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:03.670 --> 06:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
even if the
 
06:27:05.750 --> 06:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
even if the um
 
06:27:05.760 --> 06:27:07.190 align:start position:0%
even if the um
certifying

06:27:07.190 --> 06:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
certifying
 
06:27:07.200 --> 06:27:09.750 align:start position:0%
certifying
body

06:27:09.750 --> 06:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
body
 
06:27:12.310 --> 06:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
well-certified hospitals without
 
06:27:12.320 --> 06:27:13.270 align:start position:0%
well-certified hospitals without
without

06:27:13.270 --> 06:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
without
 
06:27:14.788 --> 06:27:14.798 align:start position:0%
verifying their
 
06:27:18.310 --> 06:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
adherence to the medicare medicaid rules
 
06:27:20.548 --> 06:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be up to the hospital to
 
06:27:23.830 --> 06:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
request that they certify that they do
 
06:27:25.270 --> 06:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
it would be the requirement of the
 
06:27:27.430 --> 06:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
agency to certify that they are
 
06:27:29.270 --> 06:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
compliant with those rules and
 
06:27:29.280 --> 06:27:31.430 align:start position:0%
compliant with those rules and
regulations

06:27:31.430 --> 06:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
06:27:33.270 --> 06:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
the hospital can't say
 
06:27:35.750 --> 06:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
we'll ask can we
 
06:27:37.110 --> 06:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
be certified that we're following these
 
06:27:39.110 --> 06:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
rules but not those they have to follow
 
06:27:40.708 --> 06:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
all of those rules and
 
06:27:42.310 --> 06:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
the agency would have to ensure that
 
06:27:45.910 --> 06:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:48.070 --> 06:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:27:51.590 --> 06:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative acton thank you mr chair
 
06:27:53.270 --> 06:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh mr banner for taking my
 
06:27:53.280 --> 06:27:54.230 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh mr banner for taking my
question

06:27:54.230 --> 06:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:27:54.240 --> 06:27:55.110 align:start position:0%
question
um

06:27:55.110 --> 06:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:56.788 --> 06:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
in light of the the fact that the the
 
06:27:59.590 --> 06:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine is not stopping transition
 
06:28:01.430 --> 06:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
transmission from one person to another
 
06:28:03.350 --> 06:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
i'm triple vaxxed but if i
 
06:28:05.590 --> 06:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
get coveted i can still give it to
 
06:28:08.150 --> 06:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
others uh have any hospital reel that
 
06:28:10.070 --> 06:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
reevaluated the the
 
06:28:11.910 --> 06:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
mandate that that was put in place to
 
06:28:13.750 --> 06:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
try to stop transmission from one person
 
06:28:16.628 --> 06:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
to another um i would say no um that has
 
06:28:18.310 --> 06:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
not been reevaluated and the reason is
 
06:28:20.628 --> 06:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
because you know the vaccine is very
 
06:28:22.390 --> 06:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
good at preventing
 
06:28:25.030 --> 06:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
infection but it's incredibly good at
 
06:28:26.788 --> 06:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
preventing serious illness
 
06:28:28.948 --> 06:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
hospitalization and death and what our
 
06:28:30.390 --> 06:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals tell us we meet with our
 
06:28:31.910 --> 06:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals every day we met with them
 
06:28:33.110 --> 06:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
today at noon we'll meet with them
 
06:28:35.190 --> 06:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and every day over the coming
 
06:28:37.190 --> 06:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
weeks to talk about
 
06:28:39.910 --> 06:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
managing the capacity of patients and
 
06:28:42.150 --> 06:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
you know we are seeing you know some
 
06:28:43.830 --> 06:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
patients who are breakthrough patients
 
06:28:46.150 --> 06:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
so they are vaccinated they are boosted
 
06:28:47.990 --> 06:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
and they are ending up hospitalized
 
06:28:49.830 --> 06:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
those patients tend to be those who have
 
06:28:51.750 --> 06:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
other comorbidities so they have other
 
06:28:53.510 --> 06:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
health conditions that make them more
 
06:28:56.310 --> 06:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
susceptible to serious illness but when
 
06:28:57.910 --> 06:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
we talk about you know those patients
 
06:29:00.708 --> 06:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
that are in the icu those who are very
 
06:29:03.910 --> 06:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
ill that are intubated those tend to be
 
06:29:06.868 --> 06:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly the unvaccinated so the
 
06:29:09.990 --> 06:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
the the ability to prevent that
 
06:29:12.070 --> 06:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
from happening is so vitally important
 
06:29:14.708 --> 06:29:14.718 align:start position:0%
you know right now there are over 400
 
06:29:16.628 --> 06:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
patients who are hospitalized with copa
 
06:29:19.030 --> 06:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
19. and you know that's on top of
 
06:29:21.110 --> 06:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals that are incredibly busy and
 
06:29:23.510 --> 06:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
full you know we have very few beds um
 
06:29:25.670 --> 06:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
very few icu beds trying to manage you
 
06:29:27.750 --> 06:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
know if a hospital is struggling to to
 
06:29:29.110 --> 06:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
care for those patients trying to get
 
06:29:30.628 --> 06:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
them to another hospital
 
06:29:32.788 --> 06:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
to care for them those beds are hard to
 
06:29:35.350 --> 06:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
find so we have to do everything we can
 
06:29:38.310 --> 06:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
to preserve that hospital capacity so
 
06:29:39.830 --> 06:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
that we can take care of all of our
 
06:29:41.430 --> 06:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
patients you know our hospitals have
 
06:29:43.750 --> 06:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
done an incredible job at caring for all
 
06:29:45.110 --> 06:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
of their patients over the course of
 
06:29:46.468 --> 06:29:46.478 align:start position:0%
this pandemic and they are going to
 
06:29:48.868 --> 06:29:48.878 align:start position:0%
continue to do so but they need our help
 
06:29:51.590 --> 06:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
to prevent more patients um from coming
 
06:29:53.430 --> 06:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
to the hospital that we can avoid that
 
06:29:55.590 --> 06:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
that are avoidable
 
06:29:58.468 --> 06:29:58.478 align:start position:0%
this is the chairman asking a question
 
06:30:01.670 --> 06:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'm part-time ceo of a medical facility
 
06:30:03.350 --> 06:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
on the massachusetts new hampshire
 
06:30:05.830 --> 06:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
border so our people go to facilities in
 
06:30:08.390 --> 06:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
both states it is our experience and we
 
06:30:10.390 --> 06:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
only have 2 000 patients so it's not a
 
06:30:15.110 --> 06:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
vast number that the number of people
 
06:30:15.120 --> 06:30:15.910 align:start position:0%
vast number that the number of people
who

06:30:15.910 --> 06:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:30:18.070 --> 06:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
were recently described as
 
06:30:21.190 --> 06:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly unvaccinated
 
06:30:24.230 --> 06:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's decreasing as we see more and
 
06:30:26.310 --> 06:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
more and more people
 
06:30:28.310 --> 06:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
who have been triply or troubling
 
06:30:31.030 --> 06:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and boosted and as i have
 
06:30:33.430 --> 06:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
been and so on so we're seeing under
 
06:30:36.628 --> 06:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
omicron the numbers are not in the ratio
 
06:30:39.270 --> 06:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
they were a year ago is what we see
 
06:30:41.270 --> 06:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
would that be accurate outside of our
 
06:30:43.270 --> 06:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
little patch it actually is very
 
06:30:44.868 --> 06:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
accurate and in fact
 
06:30:46.390 --> 06:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hospital association
 
06:30:47.990 --> 06:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
provides data and you can see it every
 
06:30:49.990 --> 06:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
day on our website
 
06:30:51.430 --> 06:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
that shows
 
06:30:52.310 --> 06:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
the number of patients who are
 
06:30:54.310 --> 06:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
hospitalized those patients who may
 
06:30:56.468 --> 06:30:56.478 align:start position:0%
still be hospitalized and no longer
 
06:30:58.788 --> 06:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
infected with covid um but are
 
06:31:00.468 --> 06:31:00.478 align:start position:0%
recovering they're still very ill
 
06:31:02.230 --> 06:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
they're still in the hospital but it
 
06:31:04.788 --> 06:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
also shows the vaccination status and as
 
06:31:06.468 --> 06:31:06.478 align:start position:0%
of last night
 
06:31:07.830 --> 06:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
06:31:09.990 --> 06:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
were 43
 
06:31:11.948 --> 06:31:11.958 align:start position:0%
were unvaccinated
 
06:31:15.030 --> 06:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
23.1 percent were vaccinated fully up to
 
06:31:17.350 --> 06:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
date meaning they had their their
 
06:31:19.510 --> 06:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
initial course plus if they were
 
06:31:21.110 --> 06:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
eligible they had that booster at the
 
06:31:23.430 --> 06:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate time 15 and a half percent
 
06:31:25.190 --> 06:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
were partially up to date with their
 
06:31:27.350 --> 06:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
vaccines and then another 18 percent
 
06:31:29.350 --> 06:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
were unknown and that's um you know we
 
06:31:30.788 --> 06:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
just don't know what their vaccination
 
06:31:33.030 --> 06:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
status is so we are seeing as i said
 
06:31:35.590 --> 06:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
those patients who do have breakthrough
 
06:31:37.830 --> 06:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
cases they tend to be those patients who
 
06:31:39.990 --> 06:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
have other health conditions that make
 
06:31:41.990 --> 06:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
them much more susceptible to serious
 
06:31:43.910 --> 06:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
illness but again
 
06:31:45.910 --> 06:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to prevent serious illness
 
06:31:48.150 --> 06:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
hospitalization and death the vaccine is
 
06:31:51.270 --> 06:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
is our best uh path forward to do that
 
06:31:53.990 --> 06:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative canark
 
06:31:56.468 --> 06:31:56.478 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
06:31:58.390 --> 06:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
06:32:00.468 --> 06:32:00.478 align:start position:0%
it is true what
 
06:32:01.990 --> 06:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative acton said that if you
 
06:32:04.948 --> 06:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
are infected you can transmit the virus
 
06:32:07.830 --> 06:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
but that the rate of infection
 
06:32:10.868 --> 06:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
is diminished 14-fold in the working age
 
06:32:13.430 --> 06:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
group by being vaccinated and therefore
 
06:32:16.310 --> 06:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
if a if the healthcare facility does not
 
06:32:18.628 --> 06:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
vaccinate their workforce they are
 
06:32:20.868 --> 06:32:20.878 align:start position:0%
exposing a patient who comes in for care
 
06:32:23.910 --> 06:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
to a 14-fold increase in the risk of
 
06:32:26.150 --> 06:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
becoming infected because 14-fold
 
06:32:27.430 --> 06:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of people who
 
06:32:29.110 --> 06:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
would be able to transmit
 
06:32:30.788 --> 06:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
are would you believe that that is
 
06:32:33.350 --> 06:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
correct that's absolutely uh correct i
 
06:32:35.590 --> 06:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
do believe that and it's why we need to
 
06:32:37.750 --> 06:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
do everything we can to protect those
 
06:32:39.430 --> 06:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
vulnerable patients
 
06:32:40.708 --> 06:32:40.718 align:start position:0%
when when a patient comes into the
 
06:32:42.310 --> 06:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
hospital they are incredibly vulnerable
 
06:32:44.150 --> 06:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
they're one of their most weakest points
 
06:32:46.230 --> 06:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
their immune systems are very weak and
 
06:32:48.468 --> 06:32:48.478 align:start position:0%
are susceptible to those kinds of uh
 
06:32:49.430 --> 06:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
transmission to that kind of
 
06:32:52.070 --> 06:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
transmission so again that's why we need
 
06:32:53.590 --> 06:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
to protect our patients we need to
 
06:32:55.190 --> 06:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
protect our staff and we need to protect
 
06:32:59.670 --> 06:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:02.708 --> 06:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you appreciate it
 
06:33:05.190 --> 06:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
and now as promised
 
06:33:08.468 --> 06:33:08.478 align:start position:0%
john williams esquire that means lawyer
 
06:33:10.830 --> 06:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
abby rogers i believe
 
06:33:14.070 --> 06:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
esquire no i'm sorry that was not meant
 
06:33:23.990 --> 06:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:26.468 --> 06:33:26.478 align:start position:0%
chairman pearson and member members of
 
06:33:28.150 --> 06:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
the house health committee i'm john
 
06:33:30.708 --> 06:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
williams for the record i'm the director
 
06:33:35.750 --> 06:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:38.628 --> 06:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
abby rogers legislative liaison dphs
 
06:33:40.708 --> 06:33:40.718 align:start position:0%
but not a lawyer
 
06:33:43.670 --> 06:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison
 
06:33:45.270 --> 06:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
but she does think like a lawyer and
 
06:33:46.868 --> 06:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
she's going to get credit with placement
 
06:33:49.830 --> 06:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
as to where this might belong in the rsa
 
06:33:51.910 --> 06:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you abby for that uh we are
 
06:33:55.030 --> 06:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
here today uh like very much like the
 
06:33:56.548 --> 06:33:56.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital association the
 
06:33:58.390 --> 06:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
association of counties that we have
 
06:34:00.070 --> 06:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
serious concerns about this bill to the
 
06:34:01.990 --> 06:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
point that we will be registering our
 
06:34:04.548 --> 06:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill as as introduced
 
06:34:06.390 --> 06:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
i do want to state to this committee we
 
06:34:07.910 --> 06:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
have great respect for this body the
 
06:34:09.190 --> 06:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
body of the house so we are here
 
06:34:11.270 --> 06:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
committed to working with this committee
 
06:34:12.468 --> 06:34:12.478 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to go to a
 
06:34:14.310 --> 06:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for further conversation
 
06:34:16.468 --> 06:34:16.478 align:start position:0%
discussions but i think that you've
 
06:34:18.230 --> 06:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
heard really good testimony and pretty
 
06:34:20.548 --> 06:34:20.558 align:start position:0%
much what we'd be testifying to in terms
 
06:34:22.548 --> 06:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
of the impact that would have
 
06:34:23.990 --> 06:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
relative to our licensing and
 
06:34:24.000 --> 06:34:25.670 align:start position:0%
relative to our licensing and
certification

06:34:25.670 --> 06:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
certification
 
06:34:27.270 --> 06:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
unit within the department we are
 
06:34:29.350 --> 06:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
required when overseeing licensed
 
06:34:31.030 --> 06:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
facilities under 151 and you've
 
06:34:32.948 --> 06:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
certainly been educated about what they
 
06:34:32.958 --> 06:34:33.670 align:start position:0%
certainly been educated about what they
are

06:34:33.670 --> 06:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:34:35.110 --> 06:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
by virtue of other bills we've talked
 
06:34:38.230 --> 06:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
about it it goes the whole gamut it
 
06:34:39.590 --> 06:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
includes nursing facilities at the
 
06:34:41.910 --> 06:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
county level private nursing facilities
 
06:34:44.150 --> 06:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals rehabilitation centers and so
 
06:34:46.548 --> 06:34:46.558 align:start position:0%
forth and so the concern here is if
 
06:34:47.990 --> 06:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're being
 
06:34:49.830 --> 06:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
as a state not
 
06:34:52.548 --> 06:34:52.558 align:start position:0%
allowed to enforce the laws from the
 
06:34:54.708 --> 06:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
centers for medicare and medicaid
 
06:34:57.590 --> 06:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
services it would put new hampshire at a
 
06:35:00.230 --> 06:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
very significant risk we think in terms
 
06:35:02.070 --> 06:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal impact not only to the
 
06:35:04.150 --> 06:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
loss of funding to those facilities
 
06:35:07.590 --> 06:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
under 151 because if they can't comply
 
06:35:09.830 --> 06:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
with the cms requirements they would be
 
06:35:12.230 --> 06:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
at risk of losing those funds and i just
 
06:35:13.510 --> 06:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
want to acknowledge that representative
 
06:35:15.670 --> 06:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
gay certainly did her homework on that
 
06:35:17.270 --> 06:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
particular point
 
06:35:20.948 --> 06:35:20.958 align:start position:0%
i would also say that the bill did not
 
06:35:23.670 --> 06:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
receive a request from the legislative
 
06:35:25.910 --> 06:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
office um rather strike that the
 
06:35:27.750 --> 06:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistance office for
 
06:35:30.390 --> 06:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
a fiscal analysis so we we didn't get an
 
06:35:32.070 --> 06:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in to let you know
 
06:35:34.868 --> 06:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
of this so we want to let you know that
 
06:35:37.670 --> 06:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
we would have preferred to um providing
 
06:35:39.590 --> 06:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
this information earlier to the house
 
06:35:41.910 --> 06:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
and to this committee uh relative to the
 
06:35:43.830 --> 06:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
concerns that we had uh that were well
 
06:35:45.670 --> 06:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
stated by mr annan from the hospital
 
06:35:48.788 --> 06:35:48.798 align:start position:0%
association as well as ms horgan from
 
06:35:52.310 --> 06:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
the dupont group and representing the
 
06:35:54.868 --> 06:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association of counties
 
06:35:56.390 --> 06:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
so with that there's just a couple of
 
06:35:57.830 --> 06:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
items in here to just put out for your
 
06:36:00.310 --> 06:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
consideration that the wonderful and
 
06:36:01.590 --> 06:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
should be an attorney i guess if we
 
06:36:04.150 --> 06:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
could wave people in certainly ms rogers
 
06:36:06.868 --> 06:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
would qualify but the placement within a
 
06:36:08.468 --> 06:36:08.478 align:start position:0%
new chapter and we have to recognize it
 
06:36:10.070 --> 06:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
this is not embedded in a current
 
06:36:11.750 --> 06:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
chapter under public health but it was
 
06:36:14.548 --> 06:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
actually extended as an add-on so it has
 
06:36:16.230 --> 06:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
its own chapters so
 
06:36:18.708 --> 06:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh our suggestion would be to look at
 
06:36:20.628 --> 06:36:20.638 align:start position:0%
the labor chapters and particularly
 
06:36:22.150 --> 06:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
under rsa
 
06:36:25.270 --> 06:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
275 it starts with a dash a and it works
 
06:36:27.510 --> 06:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
its way all the way up to an h so if you
 
06:36:28.948 --> 06:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
can do the alphabet better than i can
 
06:36:31.350 --> 06:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
late in the day that would be an i so we
 
06:36:33.030 --> 06:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
would recommend that this be placed as a
 
06:36:37.270 --> 06:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
new uh placement in rsa 275
 
06:36:39.430 --> 06:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
i which would be a brand new chapter
 
06:36:42.390 --> 06:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
following 275 h would you email me to
 
06:36:44.310 --> 06:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
that effect i would be more than happy
 
06:36:46.230 --> 06:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
to do that and relaying it to also to
 
06:36:48.310 --> 06:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
your uh committee researcher as well so
 
06:36:49.750 --> 06:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
we will certainly i'm not i'm not
 
06:36:52.230 --> 06:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
jealous um just send it out
 
06:36:54.868 --> 06:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
we will do that we will do that um so
 
06:36:57.030 --> 06:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
with that i i also think that in terms
 
06:36:58.708 --> 06:36:58.718 align:start position:0%
of it going to a second committee i'd
 
06:37:00.230 --> 06:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
heard judiciary certainly that would be
 
06:37:02.548 --> 06:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
a committee that may be considered for
 
06:37:04.230 --> 06:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
this but i think because of the fact as
 
06:37:06.230 --> 06:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
you see identified in line eight that it
 
06:37:07.510 --> 06:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
06:37:09.430 --> 06:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
employers and employment that we're
 
06:37:11.350 --> 06:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
talking about that setting that probably
 
06:37:13.190 --> 06:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
the labor and the
 
06:37:15.350 --> 06:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
industrial and rehabilitative services
 
06:37:17.350 --> 06:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
under representative infantine might be
 
06:37:19.350 --> 06:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
a good place for this bill to go to for
 
06:37:20.948 --> 06:37:20.958 align:start position:0%
further consideration
 
06:37:22.548 --> 06:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
i did think there was really great
 
06:37:23.990 --> 06:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
questions asked by this committee and
 
06:37:25.350 --> 06:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
i'm looking over at representative
 
06:37:27.830 --> 06:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
cushman because she always asks really i
 
06:37:29.030 --> 06:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
think really great questions that
 
06:37:31.910 --> 06:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
require some advice in legal counsel so
 
06:37:33.910 --> 06:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
again i would defer in this case because
 
06:37:35.750 --> 06:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
this is obviously an important bill to
 
06:37:37.670 --> 06:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
the house that you may want to defer to
 
06:37:39.350 --> 06:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
an objective resource that you have
 
06:37:41.590 --> 06:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
which is the house council attorney jim
 
06:37:43.910 --> 06:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
cianci is wonderful uh he will give you
 
06:37:46.310 --> 06:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
clear and objective guidance on this if
 
06:37:47.830 --> 06:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
you do have questions related to the
 
06:37:50.708 --> 06:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
bill with that also um attorney melissa
 
06:37:52.150 --> 06:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
saints here who's our chief legal
 
06:37:53.990 --> 06:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
officer for the department who actually
 
06:37:56.628 --> 06:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
was able to give both ms rogers myself a
 
06:37:58.468 --> 06:37:58.478 align:start position:0%
little bit of
 
06:38:00.150 --> 06:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
information to be able to share with you
 
06:38:02.150 --> 06:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
she also wanted us to extend to this
 
06:38:03.910 --> 06:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
committee that she would be available as
 
06:38:06.708 --> 06:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
a resource to this committee
 
06:38:09.270 --> 06:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
on this legislation because she oversees
 
06:38:11.110 --> 06:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
legal and regulatory services which
 
06:38:12.390 --> 06:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
includes the health facilities
 
06:38:15.030 --> 06:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
administrations which are charged with
 
06:38:16.868 --> 06:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
the oversight of these facilities and
 
06:38:18.390 --> 06:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with cms rules and
 
06:38:20.468 --> 06:38:20.478 align:start position:0%
regulations so with that i'd ask miss
 
06:38:21.990 --> 06:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
rogers if she has anything she would
 
06:38:23.590 --> 06:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
like to offer
 
06:38:25.270 --> 06:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh no i think john's covered it thank
 
06:38:26.548 --> 06:38:26.558 align:start position:0%
you very much we'd have to take some
 
06:38:29.590 --> 06:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:36.150 --> 06:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:37.990 --> 06:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you very
 
06:38:40.150 --> 06:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question being very
 
06:38:43.430 --> 06:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with the labor statutes
 
06:38:45.510 --> 06:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
06:38:45.520 --> 06:38:47.270 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
how

06:38:47.270 --> 06:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
how
 
06:38:47.280 --> 06:38:49.270 align:start position:0%
how
moving

06:38:49.270 --> 06:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
moving
 
06:38:51.750 --> 06:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
how or if moving this to the labor
 
06:38:51.760 --> 06:38:53.910 align:start position:0%
how or if moving this to the labor
statutes

06:38:53.910 --> 06:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
06:38:57.270 --> 06:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
presents any advantage
 
06:38:59.510 --> 06:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the concerns about the
 
06:39:02.390 --> 06:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
regulations of hospitals and and nursing
 
06:39:05.350 --> 06:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
homes and other things because
 
06:39:08.708 --> 06:39:08.718 align:start position:0%
that's still state action
 
06:39:11.190 --> 06:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the labor statute or in
 
06:39:15.670 --> 06:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:17.510 --> 06:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
and and uh if i can respond to
 
06:39:18.948 --> 06:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
representative weber's question i think
 
06:39:20.468 --> 06:39:20.478 align:start position:0%
it's a very fair question because
 
06:39:22.708 --> 06:39:22.718 align:start position:0%
certainly there's overlap but because
 
06:39:24.868 --> 06:39:24.878 align:start position:0%
the focus is on the employer employee
 
06:39:26.788 --> 06:39:26.798 align:start position:0%
relationship we would
 
06:39:26.798 --> 06:39:27.990 align:start position:0%
relationship we would
recommend

06:39:27.990 --> 06:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
06:39:29.990 --> 06:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
reviewing to look about appropriate
 
06:39:32.070 --> 06:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
placement within the labor statutes and
 
06:39:33.910 --> 06:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see other similar bills like this
 
06:39:35.430 --> 06:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
that have in fact if you look at this
 
06:39:36.948 --> 06:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
week's calendar i think you'll see no
 
06:39:39.110 --> 06:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
less than five or six bills that are in
 
06:39:40.708 --> 06:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
that same category and you'll see that
 
06:39:42.830 --> 06:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
they're all housed somewhere around the
 
06:39:45.590 --> 06:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
rsa275 range so it's not not by
 
06:39:47.350 --> 06:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
happenstance that we figured out that
 
06:39:50.070 --> 06:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
might be a place and again giving credit
 
06:39:54.468 --> 06:39:54.478 align:start position:0%
um to ms rogers for coming up with that
 
06:39:54.478 --> 06:39:57.030 align:start position:0%
um to ms rogers for coming up with that
follow-up

06:39:57.030 --> 06:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:58.708 --> 06:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
what i'm really concerned about is
 
06:40:01.110 --> 06:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh whether
 
06:40:03.600 --> 06:40:04.868 align:start position:0%
uh whether
this

06:40:04.868 --> 06:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:40:07.430 --> 06:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
statute wherever it's placed is going to
 
06:40:09.830 --> 06:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
endanger our medicare and medicaid
 
06:40:12.230 --> 06:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
funding from the federal government
 
06:40:14.548 --> 06:40:14.558 align:start position:0%
which is going to be
 
06:40:19.030 --> 06:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
a complete disaster for all of our
 
06:40:20.948 --> 06:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
patients who
 
06:40:23.270 --> 06:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
need that funding to say nothing of all
 
06:40:25.430 --> 06:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
of our institutions
 
06:40:25.440 --> 06:40:27.190 align:start position:0%
of our institutions
um

06:40:27.190 --> 06:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:27.200 --> 06:40:28.310 align:start position:0%
um
and

06:40:28.310 --> 06:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:40:31.270 --> 06:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to be clear that
 
06:40:33.750 --> 06:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
if we keep the same language even if we
 
06:40:36.708 --> 06:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
put it in a different place the same
 
06:40:40.708 --> 06:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
risks that exist now are still there
 
06:40:44.150 --> 06:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
as regards our our medical and nursing
 
06:40:47.670 --> 06:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:50.230 --> 06:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
06:40:52.788 --> 06:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
it is our belief
 
06:40:55.910 --> 06:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:57.030 --> 06:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:40:59.830 --> 06:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
counselor and most esteemed legislative
 
06:40:59.840 --> 06:41:05.110 align:start position:0%
counselor and most esteemed legislative
liaison

06:41:05.110 --> 06:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:06.868 --> 06:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
now we've got a
 
06:41:10.230 --> 06:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
batch of cards from
 
06:41:11.430 --> 06:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
the folks
 
06:41:13.510 --> 06:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
06:41:15.510 --> 06:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
and you're all asking to speak for three
 
06:41:17.110 --> 06:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
minutes and
 
06:41:18.948 --> 06:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
we're going to hold you to it
 
06:41:20.548 --> 06:41:20.558 align:start position:0%
but you can say a lot in three minutes
 
06:41:33.830 --> 06:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:35.430 --> 06:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
06:41:37.910 --> 06:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
committee members um i'm coming here
 
06:41:39.590 --> 06:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
today um
 
06:41:41.510 --> 06:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill
 
06:41:44.230 --> 06:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
and the reason is is that
 
06:41:46.788 --> 06:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
i think we all have got some
 
06:41:48.868 --> 06:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
understanding right now that some of the
 
06:41:50.628 --> 06:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
things that's going on in our in our
 
06:41:52.868 --> 06:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
country is not okay
 
06:41:55.990 --> 06:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
and we are basically enslaving to the
 
06:41:58.628 --> 06:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
federal government um because we have
 
06:42:00.948 --> 06:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
taken money and with all the federal
 
06:42:03.350 --> 06:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
money that we've taken for this robust
 
06:42:06.708 --> 06:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
response for covet 19 has now forced us
 
06:42:09.350 --> 06:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
into a situation similar to what's
 
06:42:11.590 --> 06:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
happening in washington state right now
 
06:42:14.390 --> 06:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
do you folks are you folks aware that
 
06:42:16.868 --> 06:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
people within health and human services
 
06:42:19.270 --> 06:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
that work at the state level are being
 
06:42:22.150 --> 06:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
told that they have to go house to house
 
06:42:24.310 --> 06:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
and strongly encourage vaccination for
 
06:42:28.070 --> 06:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
all members if all members do not comply
 
06:42:31.350 --> 06:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
then they are separated so children are
 
06:42:33.990 --> 06:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
being removed from their families now as
 
06:42:36.548 --> 06:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
we speak in washington state because of
 
06:42:39.110 --> 06:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
the federal money that we took for our
 
06:42:42.628 --> 06:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
robust response to covet 19. this bill
 
06:42:45.190 --> 06:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
is to try to prevent that from happening
 
06:42:47.110 --> 06:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire bottom
 
06:42:50.150 --> 06:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
line i don't care how much it costs
 
06:42:52.948 --> 06:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
i don't care how many rules we break
 
06:42:54.788 --> 06:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
with the federal government
 
06:42:57.990 --> 06:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
this is our citizens and our children
 
06:43:02.390 --> 06:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
are we truly truly willing to sacrifice
 
06:43:04.708 --> 06:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
the live free or die that we have in
 
06:43:07.910 --> 06:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
this state to comply with federal money
 
06:43:09.430 --> 06:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's all i have and i'm open to any
 
06:43:09.440 --> 06:43:11.830 align:start position:0%
that's all i have and i'm open to any

representative gay
 
06:44:03.590 --> 06:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:05.990 --> 06:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh while if this is the first time i've
 
06:44:07.430 --> 06:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
prepared before the committee this
 
06:44:09.110 --> 06:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
session i expected it will be here on
 
06:44:10.708 --> 06:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions for other bills would
 
06:44:14.230 --> 06:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
deal with similar topic topics
 
06:44:16.708 --> 06:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
and you'll see a similar refrain in our
 
06:44:18.628 --> 06:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
message to you and that is and it's
 
06:44:20.788 --> 06:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
incorporated in the letter here and that
 
06:44:23.270 --> 06:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
is the association has adopted a policy
 
06:44:25.510 --> 06:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
position with regard to a number
 
06:44:27.430 --> 06:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
of the public health bills that are
 
06:44:29.030 --> 06:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
before the committee and the legislature
 
06:44:31.750 --> 06:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
this session i won't read it to you but
 
06:44:34.070 --> 06:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
summarize it to say that
 
06:44:35.750 --> 06:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
first and foremost
 
06:44:37.750 --> 06:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
the statement thanks our thousands of
 
06:44:39.910 --> 06:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
employees who have been vaccinated and
 
06:44:41.830 --> 06:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
are taking appropriate mitigation steps
 
06:44:43.750 --> 06:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
around the pandemic
 
06:44:45.990 --> 06:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
it also expresses support for the
 
06:44:48.468 --> 06:44:48.478 align:start position:0%
efficacy of vaccinations
 
06:44:49.990 --> 06:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
and then goes on to remind the
 
06:44:51.910 --> 06:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
legislature that the mental health
 
06:44:53.430 --> 06:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
centers are
 
06:44:55.510 --> 06:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
non-profit employers
 
06:44:57.350 --> 06:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to avoid excessive
 
06:45:00.230 --> 06:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
regulation and administrative burdens
 
06:45:03.430 --> 06:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
associated with managing our employees
 
06:45:05.350 --> 06:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
so that's the nature of the the
 
06:45:07.750 --> 06:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
statement but i think it applies to to a
 
06:45:09.430 --> 06:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
lot of the legislation you have before
 
06:45:09.440 --> 06:45:10.230 align:start position:0%
lot of the legislation you have before
you

06:45:10.230 --> 06:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:45:12.310 --> 06:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
and spit specifically with regard to
 
06:45:14.390 --> 06:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 1455
 
06:45:15.910 --> 06:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
we concur with what you've heard from
 
06:45:18.070 --> 06:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
the department uh and from the county
 
06:45:19.990 --> 06:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
nursing homes that there is great
 
06:45:21.910 --> 06:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
concern that because we are
 
06:45:24.070 --> 06:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
excessively regulated by the state and
 
06:45:25.590 --> 06:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
06:45:27.350 --> 06:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
there is concern that
 
06:45:30.628 --> 06:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
the disruption in that
 
06:45:33.030 --> 06:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
oversight of the
 
06:45:35.350 --> 06:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
federal regulations by state authorities
 
06:45:37.670 --> 06:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
could be disruptive to not only the
 
06:45:39.590 --> 06:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
proper operation and our compliance with
 
06:45:41.110 --> 06:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
those regulations
 
06:45:44.468 --> 06:45:44.478 align:start position:0%
but also has the potential to put
 
06:45:46.548 --> 06:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
medicaid funds at risk
 
06:45:48.310 --> 06:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
with that i'll answer any questions uh
 
06:45:50.628 --> 06:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
either now or as a consequence of the
 
06:45:51.990 --> 06:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
letter that you've read if folks want to
 
06:45:53.350 --> 06:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
reach out to us we'll do our best to
 
06:45:59.190 --> 06:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:06.468 --> 06:46:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:09.510 --> 06:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes ian hewitt
 
06:46:14.830 --> 06:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:19.670 --> 06:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:21.510 --> 06:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
i have submitted electronic written
 
06:46:24.390 --> 06:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
testimony uh mr chair
 
06:46:28.230 --> 06:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
um ian hewitt on behalf of cornerstone
 
06:46:30.468 --> 06:46:30.478 align:start position:0%
we take no position on the current bill
 
06:46:32.390 --> 06:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
although i wish i'd marked pro so that i
 
06:46:34.150 --> 06:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
could counterbalance my fellow orange
 
06:46:36.468 --> 06:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
name tags on the other side there were a
 
06:46:36.478 --> 06:46:37.350 align:start position:0%
name tags on the other side there were a
number

06:46:37.350 --> 06:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
number
 
06:46:40.390 --> 06:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
um we do have a proposed not a specific
 
06:46:41.990 --> 06:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment but we we would
 
06:46:44.390 --> 06:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
propose an amendment which is discussed
 
06:46:46.390 --> 06:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
in the written testimony i've submitted
 
06:46:49.270 --> 06:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
electronically and which i can outline
 
06:46:49.280 --> 06:46:50.150 align:start position:0%
electronically and which i can outline
here

06:46:50.150 --> 06:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:46:52.708 --> 06:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
we understand the intent of this bill
 
06:46:54.628 --> 06:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
and i'm surprised this comparison hasn't
 
06:46:56.868 --> 06:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
come up yet in this hearing to be very
 
06:46:58.628 --> 06:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
similar to the sanctuary state
 
06:47:00.948 --> 06:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
legislation that many democratic states
 
06:47:03.670 --> 06:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
have enacted except it concerns federal
 
06:47:06.230 --> 06:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination policy instead of federal
 
06:47:08.230 --> 06:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
immigration policy
 
06:47:09.830 --> 06:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
this is an area that interests us
 
06:47:11.990 --> 06:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
because we expect that similar kinds of
 
06:47:14.468 --> 06:47:14.478 align:start position:0%
state action are going to be required in
 
06:47:16.548 --> 06:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
the coming years to protect fundamental
 
06:47:18.548 --> 06:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights like religious
 
06:47:20.948 --> 06:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
liberty and freedom of speech
 
06:47:23.430 --> 06:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
we would propose that this bill be
 
06:47:25.910 --> 06:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
brought structurally into line with the
 
06:47:28.070 --> 06:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
way democratic states often enact
 
06:47:30.070 --> 06:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
sanctuary state legislation and i'll
 
06:47:31.750 --> 06:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
give the example of our neighbors in
 
06:47:33.590 --> 06:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
vermont which is a traditional
 
06:47:35.910 --> 06:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
immigration sanctuary state i can go
 
06:47:38.230 --> 06:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
into more detail in questioning but in
 
06:47:40.310 --> 06:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
brief vermont's legislation has
 
06:47:42.548 --> 06:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
basically two components
 
06:47:44.468 --> 06:47:44.478 align:start position:0%
the first component is a general
 
06:47:46.628 --> 06:47:46.638 align:start position:0%
statement of policy that vermont
 
06:47:48.708 --> 06:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
officials will not enforce federal
 
06:47:51.030 --> 06:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
immigration law and will not collaborate
 
06:47:53.670 --> 06:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
in any way with ice
 
06:47:55.750 --> 06:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's roughly analogous to the proposed
 
06:47:58.708 --> 06:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
title 141 k in this bill
 
06:48:02.948 --> 06:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
the second component is a statute 20 vsa
 
06:48:02.958 --> 06:48:05.030 align:start position:0%
the second component is a statute 20 vsa
2366

06:48:05.030 --> 06:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
2366
 
06:48:08.390 --> 06:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
which directs agencies in vermont
 
06:48:11.750 --> 06:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
to adopt policies to implement that
 
06:48:14.708 --> 06:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
first component and to provide for the
 
06:48:14.718 --> 06:48:16.150 align:start position:0%
first component and to provide for the
suspension

06:48:16.150 --> 06:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
suspension
 
06:48:17.670 --> 06:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
or termination
 
06:48:17.680 --> 06:48:18.628 align:start position:0%
or termination
of

06:48:18.628 --> 06:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:48:20.788 --> 06:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
officials in vermont who fail to comply
 
06:48:23.190 --> 06:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
with those policies
 
06:48:26.708 --> 06:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
so we commend the intent of the sponsors
 
06:48:29.750 --> 06:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill and the speaker's remarks
 
06:48:32.150 --> 06:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
we think that the what the speaker has
 
06:48:34.548 --> 06:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
proposed is an excellent analog of the
 
06:48:36.788 --> 06:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
first component we think what should be
 
06:48:39.590 --> 06:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
added in order to make this analogous to
 
06:48:41.270 --> 06:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
sanctuary state legislation we see
 
06:48:43.510 --> 06:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
elsewhere is the second component
 
06:48:46.230 --> 06:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
statutory directives to implement the
 
06:48:48.788 --> 06:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
general court's goals as articulated in
 
06:48:53.110 --> 06:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
this bill analogous to vermont's 2366.
 
06:48:54.708 --> 06:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to take
 
06:48:56.868 --> 06:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
any questions including legal and or
 
06:48:58.948 --> 06:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
constitutional questions this is the
 
06:49:02.788 --> 06:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
chair asking you a question um
 
06:49:05.270 --> 06:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
if we're running these two things
 
06:49:07.590 --> 06:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
in parallel at least for purposes of
 
06:49:07.600 --> 06:49:09.350 align:start position:0%
in parallel at least for purposes of
argument

06:49:09.350 --> 06:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
argument
 
06:49:11.750 --> 06:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge has the feds
 
06:49:15.110 --> 06:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
swooped in on sanctuary states and done
 
06:49:16.868 --> 06:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things because they're
 
06:49:19.910 --> 06:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
clearly doing shots across the federal
 
06:49:21.910 --> 06:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
bow as we
 
06:49:24.948 --> 06:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
are possibly going to do if house bill
 
06:49:26.948 --> 06:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
1455 passes
 
06:49:29.350 --> 06:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
well if i could mr chair provide a bit
 
06:49:31.430 --> 06:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
more context by giving a bit more detail
 
06:49:33.350 --> 06:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
on vermont statute
 
06:49:35.990 --> 06:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
the first component that i mentioned
 
06:49:38.310 --> 06:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
which all state and law enforcement
 
06:49:40.150 --> 06:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
agencies in vermont are required to
 
06:49:40.160 --> 06:49:41.030 align:start position:0%
agencies in vermont are required to
follow

06:49:41.030 --> 06:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
follow
 
06:49:43.190 --> 06:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
very systematically and comprehensively
 
06:49:45.430 --> 06:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
provides that there can be no
 
06:49:47.270 --> 06:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement of federal immigration laws
 
06:49:49.350 --> 06:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
in vermont that there can be no even
 
06:49:51.990 --> 06:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
communication with federal agencies that
 
06:49:53.670 --> 06:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
are attempting to enforce federal
 
06:49:55.510 --> 06:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
immigration laws
 
06:49:59.190 --> 06:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
in vermont's case that statute 2366
 
06:49:59.200 --> 06:50:00.548 align:start position:0%
in vermont's case that statute 2366
compels

06:50:00.548 --> 06:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
compels
 
06:50:02.548 --> 06:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
all law enforcement agencies around
 
06:50:04.868 --> 06:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
vermont to adopt policies
 
06:50:08.150 --> 06:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
that allow for no more communication or
 
06:50:10.628 --> 06:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
cooperation with federal agencies than
 
06:50:12.230 --> 06:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
under that first component that i
 
06:50:14.390 --> 06:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned so we have vermont
 
06:50:16.390 --> 06:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
very directly
 
06:50:18.868 --> 06:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
not just firing a shot across the bow i
 
06:50:20.468 --> 06:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
would suggest of the federal government
 
06:50:23.190 --> 06:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
but directly substituting its own
 
06:50:25.190 --> 06:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
judgment for the federal government's
 
06:50:27.110 --> 06:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
judgment on a matter of important
 
06:50:28.468 --> 06:50:28.478 align:start position:0%
national policy
 
06:50:30.948 --> 06:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
and as you correctly indicated mr chair
 
06:50:33.110 --> 06:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature of vermont has not been
 
06:50:35.510 --> 06:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
rounded up and tried for sedition or
 
06:50:37.910 --> 06:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
other similar crimes
 
06:50:40.150 --> 06:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
there is no preemption issue when it
 
06:50:43.030 --> 06:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
comes to a sanctuary state law because a
 
06:50:45.350 --> 06:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
sanctuary state law like vermont's law
 
06:50:48.150 --> 06:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
or like this bill simply provides for
 
06:50:51.350 --> 06:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
what the state will and will not do
 
06:50:53.590 --> 06:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
it would not stop in vermont's case
 
06:50:55.430 --> 06:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
immigration and customs enforcement from
 
06:50:57.590 --> 06:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
coming in and arresting someone in the
 
06:50:59.110 --> 06:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
case of new hampshire it would not stop
 
06:51:01.830 --> 06:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
a federal agency from cutting off a
 
06:51:03.430 --> 06:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
federal participation in a federal
 
06:51:06.390 --> 06:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
program to a hospital where the hospital
 
06:51:09.350 --> 06:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
to fail to comply with federal policy
 
06:51:16.390 --> 06:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:17.830 --> 06:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you for
 
06:51:19.590 --> 06:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
taking the question you sort of touched
 
06:51:21.670 --> 06:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
upon what i wanted to ask and that spout
 
06:51:24.310 --> 06:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
to the issue with
 
06:51:27.590 --> 06:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
cms in regards to reimbursement what
 
06:51:29.990 --> 06:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing is the concern over the
 
06:51:31.990 --> 06:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
state losing the funding coming from the
 
06:51:33.270 --> 06:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
federal government for healthcare
 
06:51:33.280 --> 06:51:34.628 align:start position:0%
federal government for healthcare
programs

06:51:34.628 --> 06:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
programs
 
06:51:36.310 --> 06:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
in the ice situation
 
06:51:39.670 --> 06:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
that you're referring to is there any
 
06:51:41.430 --> 06:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
exposure for the state of vermont to
 
06:51:44.230 --> 06:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
lose significant federal funding for not
 
06:51:47.350 --> 06:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
complying with the federal mandate
 
06:51:49.270 --> 06:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
well theoretically the federal
 
06:51:52.628 --> 06:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
government could try to say condition
 
06:51:55.510 --> 06:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
highway funding for example on vermont's
 
06:51:58.628 --> 06:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement of federal immigration laws
 
06:52:00.708 --> 06:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
i think that the last federal
 
06:52:02.310 --> 06:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
administration for example would have
 
06:52:03.990 --> 06:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
liked to do that and would have liked to
 
06:52:06.468 --> 06:52:06.478 align:start position:0%
compel sanctuary states to enforce
 
06:52:08.150 --> 06:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
federal immigration laws but it wasn't
 
06:52:09.548 --> 06:52:09.558 align:start position:0%
able to do so
 
06:52:09.558 --> 06:52:11.350 align:start position:0%
able to do so
constitutionally

06:52:11.350 --> 06:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
constitutionally
 
06:52:13.510 --> 06:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government can't do what's
 
06:52:16.390 --> 06:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
called commandeering and use conditions
 
06:52:18.390 --> 06:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
to kind of forcibly take over state
 
06:52:21.110 --> 06:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
agencies and reduce them to auxiliaries
 
06:52:22.788 --> 06:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
of the federal government compelling
 
06:52:25.590 --> 06:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
them to enforce federal policy what what
 
06:52:26.708 --> 06:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
you're getting at as the federal
 
06:52:29.430 --> 06:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
government could well determine if there
 
06:52:31.030 --> 06:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
was a particular
 
06:52:32.788 --> 06:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
public program
 
06:52:35.110 --> 06:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it could determine to
 
06:52:38.468 --> 06:52:38.478 align:start position:0%
cut funds to that particular program
 
06:52:40.628 --> 06:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
if that program was not in compliance
 
06:52:42.948 --> 06:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
with federal policies this
 
06:52:45.990 --> 06:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
nor would this bill prevent that
 
06:52:47.750 --> 06:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
that the federal government is going to
 
06:52:49.430 --> 06:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
be responsible for enforcing federal
 
06:52:51.910 --> 06:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
policies and can continue to do so
 
06:52:53.830 --> 06:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
this bill would just prohibit any state
 
06:52:55.670 --> 06:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
official from acting to enforce federal
 
06:52:55.680 --> 06:52:59.670 align:start position:0%
official from acting to enforce federal
policy

06:52:59.670 --> 06:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:01.430 --> 06:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
06:53:04.468 --> 06:53:04.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
06:53:05.990 --> 06:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
um ian
 
06:53:08.788 --> 06:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
mr hyatt hewitt um
 
06:53:11.430 --> 06:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
my question is to the ideas of an
 
06:53:13.590 --> 06:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
exemption so if we were to carve out
 
06:53:15.910 --> 06:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
something for cms regulated or cms
 
06:53:19.910 --> 06:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
certified businesses and say um
 
06:53:21.270 --> 06:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know this
 
06:53:23.430 --> 06:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't stop
 
06:53:25.030 --> 06:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
them from complying
 
06:53:26.788 --> 06:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
um would
 
06:53:26.798 --> 06:53:27.990 align:start position:0%
um would
a

06:53:27.990 --> 06:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:53:30.468 --> 06:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
would language in there to allow for
 
06:53:33.110 --> 06:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
a streamlined exemption process meaning
 
06:53:35.510 --> 06:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
anyone who submits an exemption based on
 
06:53:38.788 --> 06:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
our um you know our uh constitutional
 
06:53:41.350 --> 06:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
right to religious freedom or our
 
06:53:43.430 --> 06:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to um
 
06:53:45.990 --> 06:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
con our right of conscience or for a
 
06:53:48.468 --> 06:53:48.478 align:start position:0%
medical reason
 
06:53:51.110 --> 06:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is that
 
06:53:51.990 --> 06:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
i know
 
06:53:55.110 --> 06:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
firsthand that a lot of these cms
 
06:53:55.120 --> 06:53:57.190 align:start position:0%
firsthand that a lot of these cms
certified

06:53:57.190 --> 06:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
certified
 
06:53:59.110 --> 06:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
facilities are
 
06:54:02.070 --> 06:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
using the exemption process as a
 
06:54:04.468 --> 06:54:04.478 align:start position:0%
religious inquisition and they make it
 
06:54:06.468 --> 06:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
very difficult and getting a medical
 
06:54:08.948 --> 06:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
exemption is nearly impossible you have
 
06:54:10.948 --> 06:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
to have had anaphylaxis to a previous
 
06:54:13.590 --> 06:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
dose of vaccine to even qualify for that
 
06:54:15.270 --> 06:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
and many doctors won't write it because
 
06:54:17.270 --> 06:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
they're being told that they can't
 
06:54:19.670 --> 06:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
um so my question is if we were to
 
06:54:21.750 --> 06:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
streamline that process and just say
 
06:54:23.670 --> 06:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
exemption shall be granted
 
06:54:25.990 --> 06:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
so that that would allow for the you
 
06:54:28.230 --> 06:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
know the rights of conscience of our our
 
06:54:28.240 --> 06:54:29.670 align:start position:0%
know the rights of conscience of our our
citizens

06:54:29.670 --> 06:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
06:54:32.150 --> 06:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
while allowing the businesses to still
 
06:54:34.628 --> 06:54:34.638 align:start position:0%
have a mandate in policy
 
06:54:37.430 --> 06:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
would that solve the issue
 
06:54:37.440 --> 06:54:38.468 align:start position:0%
would that solve the issue
well

06:54:38.468 --> 06:54:38.478 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:54:40.390 --> 06:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me there's two separate issues i
 
06:54:43.190 --> 06:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
think when it comes to hospitals there's
 
06:54:45.430 --> 06:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
the issue of if there is a public
 
06:54:48.150 --> 06:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
hospital for example um
 
06:54:49.670 --> 06:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
i think it would make far more sense for
 
06:54:51.510 --> 06:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
this committee to have a carve out for a
 
06:54:53.750 --> 06:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
public hospital
 
06:54:55.910 --> 06:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps of the kind you're describing
 
06:54:57.750 --> 06:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
06:55:01.910 --> 06:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
the state certifying private hospitals
 
06:55:03.910 --> 06:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
in that case i don't see what the
 
06:55:06.788 --> 06:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue is in that case the
 
06:55:09.190 --> 06:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
state can choose what it's going to do
 
06:55:11.350 --> 06:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
and what it's not going to do and it's
 
06:55:13.030 --> 06:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
up to the federal government if it so
 
06:55:16.150 --> 06:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
chooses to enforce federal policy so i
 
06:55:17.670 --> 06:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure i'm drawing the
 
06:55:20.230 --> 06:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
distinction between public hospitals and
 
06:55:22.628 --> 06:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
the state issuing certification to
 
06:55:24.548 --> 06:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
private hospitals in the in the latter
 
06:55:27.910 --> 06:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
case there isn't any kind of issue of
 
06:55:30.708 --> 06:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
constitutional preemption any more than
 
06:55:32.310 --> 06:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
there would be in the case of of the
 
06:55:32.320 --> 06:55:33.430 align:start position:0%
there would be in the case of of the
immigration

06:55:33.430 --> 06:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
06:55:35.110 --> 06:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
laws that i've discussed
 
06:55:35.120 --> 06:55:37.430 align:start position:0%
laws that i've discussed
up

06:55:37.430 --> 06:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:38.788 --> 06:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:55:38.798 --> 06:55:39.750 align:start position:0%
thank you um
so

06:55:39.750 --> 06:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:55:43.590 --> 06:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
if if we put constitutional issues aside
 
06:55:45.430 --> 06:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about the concern for
 
06:55:47.190 --> 06:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
the hospitals to continue functioning
 
06:55:50.070 --> 06:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
and serving the people of new hampshire
 
06:55:52.150 --> 06:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
would that be a
 
06:55:55.510 --> 06:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
useful mechanism to protect the rights
 
06:55:58.948 --> 06:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
of employees on one hand and the state
 
06:56:01.190 --> 06:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
and on the other hand to continue
 
06:56:02.628 --> 06:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
receiving federal funding and not put
 
06:56:04.310 --> 06:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
the hospital in the position where they
 
06:56:07.190 --> 06:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
can't be medicaid cms certified
 
06:56:08.948 --> 06:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
i i may be misunderstanding your
 
06:56:11.830 --> 06:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
question but if if your question is
 
06:56:14.150 --> 06:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
whether the state could through state
 
06:56:14.160 --> 06:56:15.830 align:start position:0%
whether the state could through state
statute

06:56:15.830 --> 06:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:56:17.910 --> 06:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
change whether certain healthcare
 
06:56:19.830 --> 06:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
providers are going to be eligible to
 
06:56:21.350 --> 06:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
participate in certain federal
 
06:56:23.190 --> 06:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
programming i understand that's not your
 
06:56:23.200 --> 06:56:24.230 align:start position:0%
programming i understand that's not your
question

06:56:24.230 --> 06:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:56:24.240 --> 06:56:25.270 align:start position:0%
question
okay

06:56:25.270 --> 06:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:56:28.070 --> 06:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
no so the idea is to allow just
 
06:56:30.070 --> 06:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
streamline exemption processes because
 
06:56:32.230 --> 06:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
currently they're allowed in this the
 
06:56:35.350 --> 06:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:37.190 --> 06:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
except for
 
06:56:37.200 --> 06:56:38.230 align:start position:0%
except for
they're

06:56:38.230 --> 06:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
they're
 
06:56:40.468 --> 06:56:40.478 align:start position:0%
becoming a very difficult
 
06:56:41.990 --> 06:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
thing to achieve
 
06:56:44.310 --> 06:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
and the hospitals are
 
06:56:47.510 --> 06:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
making it difficult deliberately in a
 
06:56:48.788 --> 06:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
number of ways
 
06:56:48.798 --> 06:56:50.390 align:start position:0%
number of ways
and

06:56:50.390 --> 06:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:56:52.390 --> 06:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
the idea would be to make that
 
06:56:54.070 --> 06:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
streamlined make it
 
06:56:54.080 --> 06:56:55.110 align:start position:0%
streamlined make it
easy

06:56:55.110 --> 06:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
easy
 
06:56:58.310 --> 06:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
and so they can comply with the cms rule
 
06:57:02.230 --> 06:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
but also accommodate the rights of the
 
06:57:02.240 --> 06:57:03.910 align:start position:0%
but also accommodate the rights of the
employees

06:57:03.910 --> 06:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
employees
 
06:57:05.830 --> 06:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
right i i do think i understand your
 
06:57:08.310 --> 06:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
question and the the state unfortunately
 
06:57:10.628 --> 06:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
i think wouldn't have the ability to
 
06:57:12.628 --> 06:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
change the exemption
 
06:57:14.948 --> 06:57:14.958 align:start position:0%
process that exists under the cms rule
 
06:57:16.390 --> 06:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
because the federal government could
 
06:57:18.628 --> 06:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
always simply elect to terminate
 
06:57:23.030 --> 06:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:26.468 --> 06:57:26.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:28.788 --> 06:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
06:57:31.670 --> 06:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
ian for um or mr hewitt for taking this
 
06:57:34.390 --> 06:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
question which is a real simple one
 
06:57:36.230 --> 06:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
i just checked my emails and i didn't
 
06:57:38.548 --> 06:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
see the electronic testimony so if you
 
06:57:40.788 --> 06:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
could send that for our records i i
 
06:57:42.788 --> 06:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate it can you do that
 
06:57:45.270 --> 06:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
i certainly can i did upload it uh
 
06:57:47.750 --> 06:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
through the sign in process the general
 
06:57:49.350 --> 06:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
court's website hasn't has an upload
 
06:57:51.190 --> 06:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
your written testimony option which i
 
06:57:52.868 --> 06:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
used but i can also simply send it
 
06:57:55.430 --> 06:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
directly to the committee i do have um
 
06:57:57.750 --> 06:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
one physical copy with me if that would
 
06:58:01.830 --> 06:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:04.070 --> 06:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
we have a machine right next door here
 
06:58:06.628 --> 06:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
that can do just that fantastic
 
06:58:06.638 --> 06:58:09.030 align:start position:0%
that can do just that fantastic
representative

06:58:09.030 --> 06:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:58:11.430 --> 06:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
you cofold you mr chairman and thank you
 
06:58:14.070 --> 06:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
mr hewitt for taking my question
 
06:58:16.948 --> 06:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that cms takes
 
06:58:19.990 --> 06:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
the position that their rule
 
06:58:23.670 --> 06:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
preempts any state and local laws
 
06:58:25.510 --> 06:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
the bill before us includes a
 
06:58:27.830 --> 06:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
severability clause
 
06:58:27.840 --> 06:58:28.788 align:start position:0%
severability clause
which

06:58:28.788 --> 06:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:58:31.110 --> 06:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
in my in the way i read it essentially
 
06:58:31.120 --> 06:58:32.788 align:start position:0%
in my in the way i read it essentially
says

06:58:32.788 --> 06:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
says
 
06:58:34.548 --> 06:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
any parts of this
 
06:58:36.468 --> 06:58:36.478 align:start position:0%
that are not applicable
 
06:58:39.110 --> 06:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh don't invalidate the rest of it
 
06:58:42.150 --> 06:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
any situation in which this is
 
06:58:44.468 --> 06:58:44.478 align:start position:0%
found to not be applicable
 
06:58:46.708 --> 06:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't render the rest of the bill
 
06:58:46.718 --> 06:58:47.670 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't render the rest of the bill
um

06:58:47.670 --> 06:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:50.628 --> 06:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
invalid so can you elaborate on that a
 
06:58:52.628 --> 06:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
little bit and and
 
06:58:55.910 --> 06:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
let us know whether you think that that
 
06:58:58.868 --> 06:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
obviates the need for a specific carve
 
06:59:01.430 --> 06:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
out or does it essentially cover us in
 
06:59:03.750 --> 06:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
the event that there are
 
06:59:03.760 --> 06:59:05.430 align:start position:0%
the event that there are
federal

06:59:05.430 --> 06:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
federal
 
06:59:07.830 --> 06:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
laws rules or regulations that would
 
06:59:09.510 --> 06:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
conflict with
 
06:59:11.590 --> 06:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
this law counselor before you answer
 
06:59:13.510 --> 06:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
could you give your single copy to my
 
06:59:16.788 --> 06:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
clerk so we can get many more copies yes
 
06:59:21.270 --> 06:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:23.110 --> 06:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
proceed thank you
 
06:59:25.190 --> 06:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
um representative kofol your question
 
06:59:26.868 --> 06:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
was about preemption and the
 
06:59:29.590 --> 06:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
severability clause it is always helpful
 
06:59:31.430 --> 06:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
constitutionally to have a severability
 
06:59:33.910 --> 06:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
clause in the event that a court finds
 
06:59:35.270 --> 06:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
there is some unconstitutional
 
06:59:37.910 --> 06:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
application of a statute they can be
 
06:59:40.468 --> 06:59:40.478 align:start position:0%
helpful in protecting the statute
 
06:59:42.628 --> 06:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
so i suppose my answer is yes it is
 
06:59:45.030 --> 06:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
helpful to have that but i think the
 
06:59:47.670 --> 06:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
example of sanctuary state laws shows
 
06:59:49.910 --> 06:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
that there isn't a preemption issue when
 
06:59:53.350 --> 06:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
it comes to a state saying it's not
 
06:59:55.430 --> 06:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to cooperate with
 
06:59:59.110 --> 06:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement of a federal law or policy
 
07:00:01.430 --> 07:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no direct conflict
 
07:00:04.070 --> 07:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
there with federal statute federal
 
07:00:07.270 --> 07:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
agencies can enforce federal law
 
07:00:08.390 --> 07:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
they can
 
07:00:10.788 --> 07:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent withdrawal funding
 
07:00:12.390 --> 07:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
for example to
 
07:00:13.910 --> 07:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know participating medical care
 
07:00:15.430 --> 07:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
providers that are not in compliance
 
07:00:17.190 --> 07:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
with their policies
 
07:00:19.430 --> 07:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
but what a sanctuary state law like this
 
07:00:22.150 --> 07:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
one would do would be to say that state
 
07:00:24.230 --> 07:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
agencies simply can't enforce those
 
07:00:26.708 --> 07:00:26.718 align:start position:0%
rules and can't cooperate with the
 
07:00:28.070 --> 07:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
federal government and the enforcement
 
07:00:30.390 --> 07:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
of those rules and as i indicated
 
07:00:32.310 --> 07:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
earlier if there was some way for the
 
07:00:34.548 --> 07:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
federal government to commandeer the
 
07:00:36.788 --> 07:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
states and force states to enforce
 
07:00:38.468 --> 07:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
federal policy
 
07:00:40.468 --> 07:00:40.478 align:start position:0%
sanctuary states on immigration i think
 
07:00:42.628 --> 07:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
we all recognize would not exist the
 
07:00:44.150 --> 07:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
last administration would have found a
 
07:00:46.708 --> 07:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
way to dispose of those
 
07:00:49.590 --> 07:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
07:00:51.190 --> 07:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:00:54.310 --> 07:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is
 
07:00:56.150 --> 07:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
as i listen to your analogy about
 
07:00:59.030 --> 07:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
sanctuary states your point is well
 
07:00:59.040 --> 07:01:00.390 align:start position:0%
sanctuary states your point is well
taken

07:01:00.390 --> 07:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
taken
 
07:01:00.400 --> 07:01:02.628 align:start position:0%
taken
but

07:01:02.628 --> 07:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:02.638 --> 07:01:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
is

07:01:03.510 --> 07:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:01:06.548 --> 07:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
let me pose a different analogy which is
 
07:01:06.558 --> 07:01:07.990 align:start position:0%
let me pose a different analogy which is
that

07:01:07.990 --> 07:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:01:08.000 --> 07:01:09.190 align:start position:0%
that
when

07:01:09.190 --> 07:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
when
 
07:01:10.628 --> 07:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
a law that i
 
07:01:13.990 --> 07:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
deplored but when we decided federally
 
07:01:16.628 --> 07:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
that everybody needed to drive 55 miles
 
07:01:18.230 --> 07:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
an hour whether they were driving in the
 
07:01:22.150 --> 07:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
middle of new york city or somewhere on
 
07:01:25.750 --> 07:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
i-93 north of concord
 
07:01:29.190 --> 07:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:31.670 --> 07:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
any state had the right
 
07:01:34.310 --> 07:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
to have any speed limit it wanted but
 
07:01:37.430 --> 07:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
federal highway funds were not going to
 
07:01:39.990 --> 07:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
flow to that state
 
07:01:42.628 --> 07:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
that was the consequence
 
07:01:42.638 --> 07:01:43.590 align:start position:0%
that was the consequence
and

07:01:43.590 --> 07:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:01:46.708 --> 07:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
my recollection is because i confessed
 
07:01:49.110 --> 07:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
to having a heavy toe
 
07:01:51.510 --> 07:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
that every single state that i drove
 
07:01:53.910 --> 07:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
through had a 55 mile an hour speed
 
07:01:56.468 --> 07:01:56.478 align:start position:0%
limit for a number of years until
 
07:01:58.468 --> 07:01:58.478 align:start position:0%
somebody worked out that we were losing
 
07:02:01.910 --> 07:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
work time that
 
07:02:01.920 --> 07:02:03.350 align:start position:0%
work time that
offset

07:02:03.350 --> 07:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
offset
 
07:02:05.830 --> 07:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
the gains in
 
07:02:09.830 --> 07:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
gas savings so
 
07:02:12.868 --> 07:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
would you believe that my concern is
 
07:02:15.910 --> 07:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
that your analogy is
 
07:02:19.030 --> 07:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
in apt and that
 
07:02:19.040 --> 07:02:19.910 align:start position:0%
in apt and that
the

07:02:19.910 --> 07:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:02:23.430 --> 07:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
federal government has ways of making
 
07:02:26.070 --> 07:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
our lives very miserable
 
07:02:26.080 --> 07:02:27.270 align:start position:0%
our lives very miserable
if

07:02:27.270 --> 07:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
07:02:30.868 --> 07:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
we choose to interfere
 
07:02:33.190 --> 07:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
not with individual build
 
07:02:35.190 --> 07:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
individual hospitals or other nursing
 
07:02:37.750 --> 07:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
homes can comply or not comply with cvcc
 
07:02:39.670 --> 07:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines as they choose this doesn't
 
07:02:42.070 --> 07:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
change that at all but if the state
 
07:02:45.270 --> 07:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
refuses to certify on the basis of this
 
07:02:48.070 --> 07:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
that they are complying with federal law
 
07:02:49.750 --> 07:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
we risk
 
07:02:53.030 --> 07:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
a much greater penalty than people risk
 
07:02:55.510 --> 07:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
when they simply enact a sanctuary state
 
07:02:55.520 --> 07:02:57.510 align:start position:0%
when they simply enact a sanctuary state
law

07:02:57.510 --> 07:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
07:02:59.510 --> 07:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge representative there
 
07:03:02.390 --> 07:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
there isn't a federal condition that
 
07:03:05.270 --> 07:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
mandates state enforcement
 
07:03:07.670 --> 07:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government i understand has
 
07:03:10.390 --> 07:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
conditions which require that in order
 
07:03:12.468 --> 07:03:12.478 align:start position:0%
to for a particular hospital for example
 
07:03:14.708 --> 07:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
to participate in such and such federal
 
07:03:16.468 --> 07:03:16.478 align:start position:0%
program it must comply with certain
 
07:03:16.478 --> 07:03:17.590 align:start position:0%
program it must comply with certain
conditions

07:03:17.590 --> 07:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
07:03:19.350 --> 07:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
but that's a separate question from
 
07:03:21.430 --> 07:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
whether the state is going to enforce
 
07:03:23.190 --> 07:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
that policy or not
 
07:03:25.430 --> 07:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
it sounds like i know all the concerns
 
07:03:28.150 --> 07:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
here we're discussing are about the cms
 
07:03:28.160 --> 07:03:29.430 align:start position:0%
here we're discussing are about the cms
mandate

07:03:29.430 --> 07:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
07:03:31.750 --> 07:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
as speaker packard indicated this was
 
07:03:33.750 --> 07:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
written before the osha mandate went
 
07:03:36.628 --> 07:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
into effect primarily written to address
 
07:03:38.310 --> 07:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
the ocean mandate and it sounds like
 
07:03:40.708 --> 07:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
implicitly we agree the ocean mandate
 
07:03:43.590 --> 07:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
would be a pretty direct analogy to the
 
07:03:45.510 --> 07:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
federal immigration laws and sanctuary
 
07:03:47.110 --> 07:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
state laws
 
07:03:49.030 --> 07:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
bill as written also says that it
 
07:03:52.310 --> 07:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
addresses any federal vaccination
 
07:03:55.590 --> 07:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
mandate uh rule or law so it could be
 
07:03:58.150 --> 07:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
understood to be primarily prospective
 
07:04:00.390 --> 07:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
in that sense and to anticipate any
 
07:04:03.270 --> 07:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
future federal law a rule that might
 
07:04:03.280 --> 07:04:05.350 align:start position:0%
future federal law a rule that might
arise

07:04:05.350 --> 07:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
arise
 
07:04:07.430 --> 07:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
07:04:10.548 --> 07:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
the state withdrawing funding the
 
07:04:11.830 --> 07:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
federal government withdrawing funding
 
07:04:13.510 --> 07:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
from hospitals the federal government
 
07:04:16.070 --> 07:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
could do that and that wouldn't be
 
07:04:18.708 --> 07:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
in conflict with this law
 
07:04:20.548 --> 07:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
now i should i should mention you also
 
07:04:22.390 --> 07:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
raised the issue of the federal
 
07:04:24.070 --> 07:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
government conditioning federal highway
 
07:04:26.548 --> 07:04:26.558 align:start position:0%
funds on having a certain speed limit
 
07:04:29.670 --> 07:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
there is a law in federal constitutional
 
07:04:31.030 --> 07:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
law between
 
07:04:33.270 --> 07:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate conditioning of funds and
 
07:04:35.510 --> 07:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
commandeering there is a certain point
 
07:04:38.230 --> 07:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
that that case law delineates at which
 
07:04:40.150 --> 07:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
conditioning of funds rises to the level
 
07:04:43.030 --> 07:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
of commandeering that's unconstitutional
 
07:04:44.468 --> 07:04:44.478 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't be able to speak at this
 
07:04:46.788 --> 07:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
moment to exactly where that line is but
 
07:04:49.190 --> 07:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
i think we can see when it comes to
 
07:04:50.468 --> 07:04:50.478 align:start position:0%
in general
 
07:04:52.910 --> 07:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
state enforcement of a federal policy or
 
07:04:54.708 --> 07:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
non-cooperation with
 
07:04:56.628 --> 07:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
that federal policy which is what we're
 
07:04:58.230 --> 07:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
talking about in this case not what
 
07:05:01.030 --> 07:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
policy the states have like in the case
 
07:05:03.670 --> 07:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
of of speed limits then there isn't a
 
07:05:05.510 --> 07:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
preemption issue and the state decides
 
07:05:07.510 --> 07:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
not to enforce or cooperate with
 
07:05:12.070 --> 07:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:16.948 --> 07:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:18.468 --> 07:05:18.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
07:05:21.110 --> 07:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
quite taking the question
 
07:05:22.390 --> 07:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
i spent 10 years on the board of
 
07:05:25.510 --> 07:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacy and i'm not an attorney
 
07:05:26.468 --> 07:05:26.478 align:start position:0%
but we spend a lot of time with
 
07:05:26.478 --> 07:05:27.990 align:start position:0%
but we spend a lot of time with
attorneys

07:05:27.990 --> 07:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
07:05:29.270 --> 07:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
and you're raising a very interesting
 
07:05:30.788 --> 07:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
point because
 
07:05:32.548 --> 07:05:32.558 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that would often
 
07:05:33.750 --> 07:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
get raised
 
07:05:36.070 --> 07:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
is why do we have to
 
07:05:37.590 --> 07:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
put into
 
07:05:41.110 --> 07:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
rules but the government federally has
 
07:05:42.708 --> 07:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
and what i've been told time and time
 
07:05:45.510 --> 07:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
again and probably could have been wrong
 
07:05:47.670 --> 07:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
is that the federal government can force
 
07:05:49.270 --> 07:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
federal laws
 
07:05:52.390 --> 07:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
the state government enforces state law
 
07:05:54.150 --> 07:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
and why this duplicate duplication
 
07:05:56.070 --> 07:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
between the two is the fact that if the
 
07:05:56.080 --> 07:05:57.510 align:start position:0%
between the two is the fact that if the
state

07:05:57.510 --> 07:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:05:59.830 --> 07:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
agency wants to enforce a law it really
 
07:06:02.548 --> 07:06:02.558 align:start position:0%
has to reply upon state law not per se
 
07:06:04.548 --> 07:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
federal law that they are sort of
 
07:06:06.150 --> 07:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
co-mingled but they really are somewhat
 
07:06:06.160 --> 07:06:07.110 align:start position:0%
co-mingled but they really are somewhat
separate

07:06:07.110 --> 07:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
separate
 
07:06:08.468 --> 07:06:08.478 align:start position:0%
so can you help me understand the role
 
07:06:10.150 --> 07:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
between the federal agency and its
 
07:06:12.548 --> 07:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement versus the state agency and
 
07:06:14.150 --> 07:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
its enforcement
 
07:06:16.310 --> 07:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
well states often do cooperate in the
 
07:06:17.910 --> 07:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement of federal laws and that's
 
07:06:20.230 --> 07:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
why democratic states enact sanctuary
 
07:06:22.390 --> 07:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
state laws we see for example in states
 
07:06:23.910 --> 07:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
that are not sanctuary states
 
07:06:25.670 --> 07:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
immigration and customs enforcement
 
07:06:27.750 --> 07:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
frequently will call up local law
 
07:06:29.270 --> 07:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement departments and ask for
 
07:06:30.390 --> 07:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
their help
 
07:06:33.190 --> 07:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
in enforcing federal immigration laws in
 
07:06:35.190 --> 07:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
sanctuary states that simply doesn't
 
07:06:35.200 --> 07:06:36.070 align:start position:0%
sanctuary states that simply doesn't
happen

07:06:36.070 --> 07:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
happen
 
07:06:37.270 --> 07:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
which means it's up to the federal
 
07:06:39.830 --> 07:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
government to enforce its own laws and
 
07:06:41.190 --> 07:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that is the distinction we're
 
07:06:43.430 --> 07:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
talking about here is it's a federal
 
07:06:45.510 --> 07:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
policy this bill specifically
 
07:06:49.030 --> 07:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
anticipates any federal policy or rule
 
07:06:51.590 --> 07:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
requiring vaccination and says the state
 
07:06:54.150 --> 07:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
will not cooperate in the enforcement of
 
07:06:55.830 --> 07:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
that policy
 
07:06:58.468 --> 07:06:58.478 align:start position:0%
i mean likewise with the vaccination
 
07:07:01.030 --> 07:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
mandate back when it was anticipated the
 
07:07:03.830 --> 07:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
osha mandate would go into effect we
 
07:07:06.070 --> 07:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
were seeing osha say we expect to
 
07:07:08.390 --> 07:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
cooperate with state departments of
 
07:07:10.070 --> 07:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
labor for example in state law
 
07:07:11.910 --> 07:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement and ensuring that this is
 
07:07:11.920 --> 07:07:13.110 align:start position:0%
enforcement and ensuring that this is
enforced

07:07:13.110 --> 07:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
07:07:15.750 --> 07:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
so it is quite common for the federal
 
07:07:17.830 --> 07:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
government to look to state agencies to
 
07:07:19.750 --> 07:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
help them enforce
 
07:07:21.510 --> 07:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
federal laws but there is no
 
07:07:23.590 --> 07:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional preemption reason that
 
07:07:26.070 --> 07:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
the state needs to cooperate with the
 
07:07:27.590 --> 07:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
federal government enforcing its own
 
07:07:27.600 --> 07:07:29.350 align:start position:0%
federal government enforcing its own
policies

07:07:29.350 --> 07:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
policies
 
07:07:31.270 --> 07:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
07:07:33.270 --> 07:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh would you
 
07:07:35.350 --> 07:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
believe that florida actually passed an
 
07:07:38.150 --> 07:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
exemption bill um like i was describing
 
07:07:39.910 --> 07:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
and it's working quite well
 
07:07:43.190 --> 07:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
nurses just submit a one sentence um i'm
 
07:07:46.708 --> 07:07:46.718 align:start position:0%
i'm exempt for x reason and it's granted
 
07:07:49.670 --> 07:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
and it and that cms actually doesn't
 
07:07:51.750 --> 07:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
dictate how exemptions are granted it
 
07:07:54.230 --> 07:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
just allows for them
 
07:07:55.990 --> 07:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
um i would believe that i would be
 
07:07:58.788 --> 07:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
interested to know how that policy has
 
07:08:00.868 --> 07:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
interacted with the supreme court's
 
07:08:00.878 --> 07:08:01.910 align:start position:0%
interacted with the supreme court's
holding

07:08:01.910 --> 07:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
holding
 
07:08:04.390 --> 07:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
in the recent cms case
 
07:08:05.510 --> 07:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
and whether there have been any new
 
07:08:07.190 --> 07:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
developments in florida since that
 
07:08:09.270 --> 07:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
holding was issued but i would believe
 
07:08:09.280 --> 07:08:11.110 align:start position:0%
holding was issued but i would believe
that

07:08:11.110 --> 07:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:08:12.948 --> 07:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
07:08:15.350 --> 07:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
mr hewitt thank you counselor
 
07:08:17.350 --> 07:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll look forward to well we
 
07:08:19.030 --> 07:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
actually got it already thank you i
 
07:08:24.468 --> 07:08:24.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:26.390 --> 07:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's just handed around
 
07:08:28.868 --> 07:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
it's got his name on the back
 
07:08:31.110 --> 07:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
were we short a few how many did you
 
07:08:34.948 --> 07:08:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:37.270 --> 07:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
oh i got two
 
07:08:38.788 --> 07:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:08:40.708 --> 07:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
the one who has to share with the one
 
07:08:43.350 --> 07:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
who has none thank you thank you
 
07:08:46.468 --> 07:08:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:48.548 --> 07:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
and how are we doing
 
07:08:52.070 --> 07:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
wonderfully appear five loaves two fish
 
07:08:52.080 --> 07:09:02.708 align:start position:0%
wonderfully appear five loaves two fish
multitudes

07:09:02.708 --> 07:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:04.788 --> 07:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
the clerk needs two one for herself one
 
07:09:07.190 --> 07:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
for the files the chair recognizes i
 
07:09:09.190 --> 07:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
think this is karen if not please let me
 
07:09:19.430 --> 07:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:21.830 --> 07:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
07:09:24.230 --> 07:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
committee um i'm actually here in
 
07:09:27.110 --> 07:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
support of hb 1455.
 
07:09:29.190 --> 07:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
um what representative cushman was just
 
07:09:30.788 --> 07:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
referring to i think is a very very
 
07:09:32.868 --> 07:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
vital point of
 
07:09:34.628 --> 07:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
i think as we discussed this i'm not an
 
07:09:34.638 --> 07:09:35.590 align:start position:0%
i think as we discussed this i'm not an
attorney

07:09:35.590 --> 07:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
07:09:38.310 --> 07:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
but when i do think about religious or
 
07:09:40.788 --> 07:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
medical or even natural immunity the
 
07:09:40.798 --> 07:09:42.390 align:start position:0%
medical or even natural immunity the
exemptions

07:09:42.390 --> 07:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
07:09:44.230 --> 07:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
it really gets down to
 
07:09:46.230 --> 07:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
being unconstitutional as far as title
 
07:09:49.270 --> 07:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
vii and i think this whole pandemic has
 
07:09:52.150 --> 07:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
been you know uncharted territories for
 
07:09:53.750 --> 07:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
for many
 
07:09:56.150 --> 07:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
and i sit here today unemployed because
 
07:09:59.110 --> 07:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
my exemption was denied um and then it
 
07:10:00.948 --> 07:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
got even worse when i filed for
 
07:10:03.750 --> 07:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment and it was due to supposed
 
07:10:06.390 --> 07:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
misconduct because my medical religious
 
07:10:08.788 --> 07:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
exemption or natural immunity was not
 
07:10:11.590 --> 07:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
um recognized so i think you know i
 
07:10:13.990 --> 07:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
understand the hospital associations in
 
07:10:15.990 --> 07:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
the the elderly folks homes you know i
 
07:10:18.310 --> 07:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
think that their my concern comes in as
 
07:10:19.430 --> 07:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
someone that has
 
07:10:20.628 --> 07:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
07:10:22.708 --> 07:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
cardiologists primary care physicians
 
07:10:24.708 --> 07:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
hematologists oncologists for the last
 
07:10:27.590 --> 07:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
20 years i'm very confused as to why
 
07:10:29.510 --> 07:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
physicians are being penalized if they
 
07:10:31.750 --> 07:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
potentially want to prescribe ivermectin
 
07:10:31.760 --> 07:10:32.430 align:start position:0%
potentially want to prescribe ivermectin
or

07:10:32.430 --> 07:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:10:34.548 --> 07:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
hydroxychloroquine that has been proven
 
07:10:37.110 --> 07:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
to be effective and helpful in early
 
07:10:39.190 --> 07:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
treatment why are patients being sent
 
07:10:41.190 --> 07:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
home and told wait till you're sick and
 
07:10:42.868 --> 07:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
then they come back and the protocol
 
07:10:45.590 --> 07:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
being passed out by anthony fauci
 
07:10:48.070 --> 07:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
is for folks to be put on ram desevere
 
07:10:50.468 --> 07:10:50.478 align:start position:0%
that causes kidney failure and promotes
 
07:10:53.110 --> 07:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
fluid to the lungs so i'm very confused
 
07:10:53.120 --> 07:10:53.910 align:start position:0%
fluid to the lungs so i'm very confused
by

07:10:53.910 --> 07:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
by
 
07:10:55.110 --> 07:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of these
 
07:10:56.788 --> 07:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
things that are being rolled out so i'm
 
07:10:58.468 --> 07:10:58.478 align:start position:0%
encouraged to hear things that are
 
07:11:00.230 --> 07:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
happening in florida that potentially is
 
07:11:01.670 --> 07:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
something that we could consider here in
 
07:11:02.868 --> 07:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
07:11:04.548 --> 07:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's a republican or a
 
07:11:06.948 --> 07:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
democrat issue it's not a vaccinated or
 
07:11:08.788 --> 07:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated issue
 
07:11:11.430 --> 07:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's really about the constitution and i
 
07:11:12.868 --> 07:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
think that's what our founding fathers
 
07:11:15.030 --> 07:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
developed the constitution was for to
 
07:11:17.350 --> 07:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
avoid overreach of government and i
 
07:11:19.110 --> 07:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
really that's what i hope that we can
 
07:11:21.510 --> 07:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
come to a conclusion i think this bill
 
07:11:23.590 --> 07:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
just stops the mandates that it's a very
 
07:11:25.910 --> 07:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
slippery slope if we allow the federal
 
07:11:28.150 --> 07:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
government because of funding to start
 
07:11:29.670 --> 07:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
to dictate what we
 
07:11:31.670 --> 07:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
we actually happens to our own
 
07:11:33.750 --> 07:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
individual bodies whether whether i
 
07:11:35.910 --> 07:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
would want to take a vaccine or not i've
 
07:11:37.590 --> 07:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
taken vaccines i've played professional
 
07:11:39.670 --> 07:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
basketball over in switzerland i had to
 
07:11:42.788 --> 07:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
take the typhoid shot i'm not anti-vaxx
 
07:11:45.590 --> 07:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
but this particular vaccine does not
 
07:11:48.390 --> 07:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
have enough safety and efficacy data
 
07:11:49.910 --> 07:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
and when there's people that that
 
07:11:51.990 --> 07:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
actually created
 
07:11:52.000 --> 07:11:52.788 align:start position:0%
actually created
the

07:11:52.788 --> 07:11:52.798 align:start position:0%

07:11:54.548 --> 07:11:54.558 align:start position:0%

07:11:56.310 --> 07:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
totalitarianism
 
07:11:58.628 --> 07:11:58.638 align:start position:0%

natural immunity have more protection
