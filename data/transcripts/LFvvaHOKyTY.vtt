00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
consider an amendment or here testimony
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
on an amendment uh from all of you uh on
 
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 619 it is amendment number
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
2023 hyen 2359
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
H um it is our custom in this committee
 
00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
and has been our practice for this past
 
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
year to allow the prime sponsor extra
 
00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:12.919 align:start position:0%
time because they're giving the
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
background and the Genesis of the bill
 
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
representative Lon I'd ask her to come
 
00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
forward at this time she is the prime
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh she has agreed to abide by
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
the same three minute rule that all
 
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
individuals will be asked to abide by
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
and we do have a three-minute uh rule on
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
testimony mainly because we want to
 
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that everybody has a equal chance
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
to to participate and offer their input
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry representative
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman I have a
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
point of order which is that having
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
looked very carefully at the side by
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
side um there are modifications to the
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
original bill but there is no added
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
content that is different from the
 
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
subject matter of of the original Bill
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
and therefore I fail to understand how
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
this is a non- gerine Amendment it is my
 
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that the speaker has
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
however ruled that it is a non-gain
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment so we are where we are because
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
he is the speaker and I am not uh but I
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
just want it to be clear that I think
 
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
that this hearing is simply a second
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
rehearing of a hearing we've already had
 
00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
and I I thank you very much for your
 
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
Indulgence and letting me say so
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you for that uh that
 
00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
comment representative Weber uh this
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
both the speaker and the clerk have have
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
been consulted on this matter and they
 
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
both are in agreement that this hearing
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
was was necessary so accordingly we we
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
are here uh representative Le if I may
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
make one correction the clerk assures me
 
00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
that the speaker ruled that it was a
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
non-gain Amendment okay okay thank you
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
Leon good morning Mr chairman members of
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
the committee and members of the public
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Erica Leon and
 
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
I represent the town of Derry I want to
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
start off by speaking to the transgender
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
community and those who love them this
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
amendment and the bill that it replaces
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
do not seek to erase you we do not seek
 
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
to invalidate your experience this
 
00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
effort is to prioritize your lifelong
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
health and well-being by Pro pumping the
 
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.519 align:start position:0%
brakes on the rapid adoption of this
 
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
medical care for your age group we know
 
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
that you were focused on your personal
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
struggles and on finding an immediate
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
solution I get that but as somebody who
 
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
worked with medical Innovation for
 
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
almost two decades I know that it's also
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that there are
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
data in people like you and by like you
 
00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:03.079 align:start position:0%
I mean your age and your prior medical
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
history before getting too excited that
 
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
some surgery will in fact change your
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
life for the better without unexpected
 
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
side effects for over a
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
decade representative excuse me I'm
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
sorry I have one more point of order
 
00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
which is I don't believe that signs are
 
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
allowed in the committee rooms are they
 
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
not I'm sorry you're going to have to
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
leave it uh put that down it's down
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you sorry thank you
 
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
resume representative Leon for over a
 
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
decade I worked to find money to drive
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
Research into new medical Technologies
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
and expand them to New Markets I saw the
 
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
successes and I also saw the body count
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
of the failures I saw how one failed
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
medical intervention can Cascade into a
 
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
lifetime of poor health and reduce
 
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
quality of life and my experience was
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
usually with people much older than
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
teenagers usually on the opposite end of
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
the age Spectrum the amendment we're
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
discussing today replaces the entire
 
00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:04.519 align:start position:0%
original bill that means the school
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
section is out entirely as is discussion
 
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
of puberty blockers cross- sex hormones
 
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
and surgeries such as masectomy today
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
we're talk here to talk about two things
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
first is should the state of New
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire allow bottom surgeries in
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
people under 18 some ask if these
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
surgeries are done in New Hampshire
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully there's people behind me that
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
can give us solid conclusive data
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
however we do know that Boston
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
Children's Hospital vaginoplasties are
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
done in those who are 17 and
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
older in a world path uh World path
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
study um a survey in
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
2017 of 20 centers in the US that
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
provide this care half of them provided
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
genital surgeries to minors so this is
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
something that is happening the question
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
is is this something that we should be
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
doing in this this state or should we
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
allow the science to proceed without us
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
with those who really need to see it
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
going to other states and the people of
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
the state waiting for more data so that
 
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
outcomes right now it's only
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
vaginoplasties that can happen in those
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
that are 17 phop plasties have such high
 
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
risk of um of a need for reintervention
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
early on it's almost 60% that those
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed by guidelines and those
 
00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:22.519 align:start position:0%
who are under
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
18 if you look to the handout that I
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
gave you this one here from the Mosaic
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
Clinic in San Francisco go it speaks to
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
the type of vaginoplasty that is done in
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
miners it's the part where I I
 
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
underlined who can get a PPT
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
vaginoplasty this surgery can be a great
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
option for patients whose other options
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
are limited to including colon
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
vaginoplasty this includes patients
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
needing revision surgery a few others
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
and patients who have been on puberty
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
blockers patients also can choose to
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
have this type of vagary plasty as their
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
primary surgery if they understand and
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
accept the that there are no long-term
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
data on the outcomes of this
 
00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
surgery we asked the question do we
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
legislate the practice of
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
medicine in 2018 this legislature said
 
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:13.759 align:start position:0%
yes when they banned conversion therapy
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
for minors there are no long-term data
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
on vagin PPT vaginoplasties and that is
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
the only realistic solution offered in
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
this age group and representative L on
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
your time is up thank you any questions
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did you have a
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
question I was just going to say that we
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
do have a longstanding permission for
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
the uh author of a u particular
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to be able to present it so I
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
have no objection to that happening yeah
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
I mean representative Lon did wave that
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh she did want to abide by the feem
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
minute well I did give you a few little
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
extra time because of the interruption
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
earlier um but uh you know again
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
represent just sure
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely yeah representative
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
Missour thank you for taking my question
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
can you tell me a little bit more about
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
the second part of this bill oh yes
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you representative
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
Missour and thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
and representative Weber um this the
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
second part of this bill is when this
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
body decided to legislate the practice
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
of medicine back in
 
00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
2018 in 2017 the bill a bill was
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
introduced to Pro prohibit what really
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
is a barbaric practice and it fell out
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
of favor decades in the
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
past in the past horrible things were
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
done by people to try and make their
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
sexuality conform and that's simply not
 
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
okay at the time there was the concern
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
about how do we also make sure that this
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
bill that this what now law this this
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
prohibition on certain medical practices
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
in our law doesn't impact the
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
transgender Community the way that that
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
was done is there was a line was added
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
that said that
 
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry there was the one that said
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
that um that if you're undergoing gender
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
transition it's not conversion therapy
 
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
the problem is we heard two years ago
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
that this is limiting the practice of
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
medicine there are some providers who
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
are afraid to come to New Hampshire and
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
treat minors because they don't know
 
00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
what would be considered to be um
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
practices or treatments that seek to
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
change their gender or G gender identity
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
in the world path guidelines they
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
actually Define conversion therapy as
 
00:16:32.829 --> 00:16:32.839 align:start position:0%
attempts to
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
compel um attempts to compel a change in
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
gender or a change in gender ideology um
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
I believe that the words attempt to
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
compel are far easier to understand and
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
one that a provider would be less afraid
 
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
of inadvertently uh of having a memory
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
from a patient um than bring them to the
 
00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:53.350 align:start position:0%
from a patient um than bring them to the
licensing

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
board we also have the issue that the
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
language that somebody pursuing a gender
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
transition is not inclusive to those who
 
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
take a more Meandering path or those
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
whose ultimate Destiny is a non
 
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.039 align:start position:0%
non-binary identity right now the way
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
that the language is written um if the
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
licensing board were to take this on its
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
face value Physicians who are following
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
guidelines which say that healthc Care
 
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
Professionals working with gender
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
diverse adolescence should facilitate
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
exploration and expression of gender
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
openly and respected so that no
 
00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
particular gender identity is favored
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
that this could cause a problem that's
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
why I have brought some other language
 
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
to better clarify this language I want
 
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everybody is treated
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
with respect and that we aren't
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
experimenting on our
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
17-year-olds according to that clinic in
 
00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:51.590 align:start position:0%
17-year-olds according to that clinic in
San

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
San
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
Francisco there are no long-term data we
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
should pump the brakes and we should
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
also clarify that language because if we
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
have three more providers that are
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
providing mental health care in New
 
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that means we're looking at
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
maybe 600 more appointments for our
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
youth we're in a crisis among all youth
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
transgender Youth and other youth we
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that those services
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
are available and I believe that by
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
taking the hard CH hard hard task of
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
actually trying to change this language
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to save
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
lives thank you thank you other
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
representative Leon for taking my
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
question I noticed in the bill if you go
 
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
back and look at on page
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
33-35 there's a reference to the
 
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
insurance not being able to provide
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
coverage for this can you help me
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
understand that in the world of Arissa
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
which is a federal law that most
 
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
insurance companies today are
 
00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
self-funded and therefore therefore come
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
under Arisa we cannot as a state
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
supersede what the federal law says
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
within Arissa so in essence even though
 
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking talking about trying to
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
minimize the insurance coverage in
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
essence we're talking about a very small
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of the population at best 15%
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
maybe 18% that would be impacted so can
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
you speak to that issue between the
 
00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
state law which what you're talking
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
about and orisa which is a
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Merchant for
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
that question when I brought this
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
amendment it was out of our work as a
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to try and find those areas
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
that we may be able to agree upon which
 
00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:42.039 align:start position:0%
is on the genital surgery on minors and
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps finding more respectful language
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
on conversion therapy the way that I did
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
that was to take the existing section
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
that dealt with the medical care and
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
simply change it so that it wasn't for
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
all gender conversion therapy but to
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
limit it to the genital gender
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgeries um
 
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
we can talk about those details about
 
00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
that specific language but now that we
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
actually have a proposal that U May that
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
that may actually solve the needs of our
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
state I think that that's something for
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
us to work through if we did not have
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
that section in there would you be would
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
you would you be more supportive if we
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
remove that section followup
 
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um thank you
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
for addressing the question it does to
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
your point it does not really get to the
 
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
detail between federal law versus state
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
law which we cannot obviously
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
exceed this federal law change the
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
federal law through a state law but back
 
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
to the other question I have is this
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
deals with a parent as well and we
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
talked about this
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
earlier why are we talking about parents
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
and parental rights on one side of the
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
equation but now we're talking about not
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
giving the parents on the other side the
 
00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
same rights here because this is really
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
coming down to having the parent and if
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
I understand all arguing about parental
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
rights it's parents rights suede yet
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
here those rights don't so explain to me
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
why a parent on one side of the equation
 
00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
has all these rights but now we're
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
taking them away um thank you for the
 
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
question to the first to the first point
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
of this follow-up question there are
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
over half of the states that even in
 
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
their Medicare programs and their
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid pro programs they do not pay
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
for these surgeries so while there is a
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
f federal law not all states are
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
following that um but we can discuss
 
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
that portion um when we meet together as
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee or a full Committee in
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
exec um to your second point
 
00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
parental rights um are limited at some
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
points a parent can't authorize their
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
child to go use heroin and then mean
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
that that is within rights we know that
 
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
heroin is dangerous and nobody would do
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
that but a parent also can't authorize
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
their child to go suntanning in the
 
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire because those
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
under 18 cannot go to a tanning salon
 
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
those under 18 can't get a driver's
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
license without their parents paying for
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
um the state sponsored or the state
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
endorsed driver's
 
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
training we need to look at the entire
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
landscape and it's not an issue of
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
either we're entirely permissive and
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely anything goes in a state of
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
Anarchy or one in which the state is
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
your actual parent we need to look at
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
that nuance and understand that most
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
people don't realize that when you're 17
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
and if you've been on puberty blockers
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
your only option is a paranal
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
vaginoplasty one which the Mosaic um
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
Clinic in San Francisco
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
appropriately says has no long-term data
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
on outcomes this is one of those areas
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
where parents are looking to do the
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
absolute best that they can for their
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
kids but they're not going to understand
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
that detail and Nuance to know that the
 
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
PPT ones are very different than the
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
ones that have been done for decades the
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
risks are much higher and the durability
 
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
the the need for revision is different
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
look I come from the world of orth of
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
Orthopedics and all sorts of medical
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
devices with knes as you get two shots
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
on goal you wait as long as possible for
 
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
your first knee replacement because when
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
that fails you'll get a revision surgery
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
that takes even more bone after that
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
revision surgery you will be in a
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
wheelchair and that's just your knee on
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
the vaginoplasties you can have a
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
primary surgery and then a revision
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
surgery and then you're going into
 
00:23:19.559 --> 00:23:21.590 align:start position:0%
surgery and then you're going into
groundbreaking

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
groundbreaking
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
territory by pumping the brakes and
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
saying wait a little longer see about
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
some data and don't think that you're
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
getting the same surgery that your older
 
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559 align:start position:0%
neighbor had we can make sure that
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
nobody is getting that knee at 25 or 17
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
and then suddenly when they have an
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
infection they have something else in
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
need of revision and then that has a
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
problem later they're left without
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
options I want to
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
prioritize the health of 80-year-old
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
transgenders just as much as 18 and I
 
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
want those 18-year-olds to grow up and
 
00:23:58.269 --> 00:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
be healthy and live a long good
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
productive happy life with as few
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
medical complications as possible I
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
think that drawing a line and stopping
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
these PPT uh vaginoplasties will protect
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
more and will increase Everybody's
 
00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:13.149 align:start position:0%
more and will increase Everybody's
Health

00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
overall thank you any other questions
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you very much
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify this morning
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
pred is it Reed or
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
pred it's Reed thank you sorry I just uh
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
no that's okay getting testimony for you
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
handwriting thank you thank you so much
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
you have about three minutes thank you
 
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
um chair and uh representative Leon uh
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
for considering my testimony I wanted to
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
speak to a few key
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
considerations uh or um opposing this
 
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
amendment uh as representing the ACLU of
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
um and largely speaking to that uh like
 
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
the original Bill uh unfortunately the
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
amendment remains as h hostile
 
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that unfairly targets and
 
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
discriminates against transgender and
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
gender non-conforming people in the
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
granite state and that even though um as
 
00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:42.039 align:start position:0%
you'll hear and as uh allies in the
 
00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
lgbtq advocacy Community have heard from
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
providers that gender affirming
 
00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039 align:start position:0%
surgeries and minors are exceptionally
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
rare a total ban that overrides private
 
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
medical decisions between doctors and
 
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
their families is unnecessary and
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
harmful and it's Reckless for
 
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
legislators to deny vulnerable people
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
care that their doctors May believe is
 
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.430 align:start position:0%
care that their doctors May believe is
medically

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
medically
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
necessary and a threat to
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
anyone um element of gender affirming
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
care leaves room for future attacks on
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
age appropriate care for transgender
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
Youth and gender affirming care is
 
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
widely recognized as being the only
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
evidence-based approach to addressing
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
the healthcare needs of transgender
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
adolescents including severe mental
 
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.389 align:start position:0%
adolescents including severe mental
health

00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
risks and according to the medical uh
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
American Medical
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
Association uh evidence that restricting
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
access to gender firming care can
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
produce tragic effects on transgender
 
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
persons disproportionately at risk of
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
anxiety stress substance use disorder
 
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.470 align:start position:0%
anxiety stress substance use disorder
and

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
suicide and I want to stress that the
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
amendment singles out restrictions to
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
health care for transgender Youth and
 
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
the prohibition of genital gender
 
00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.549 align:start position:0%
the prohibition of genital gender
reassignment

00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:53.559 align:start position:0%
reassignment
 
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
surgery uh and that it this restriction
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
only applies to transgender youth
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
however not to minors with disorders of
 
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.830 align:start position:0%
however not to minors with disorders of
sex

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
sex
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
development despite that these
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
procedures as I stated are exceedingly
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
uncommon for youth to undergo this
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
language sends a message to health that
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
the healthcare needs of trans people are
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
less valid than those of intersex
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
individuals or individuals with sex
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
developmental disorders and there have
 
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
been various appell Court decisions that
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
have ruled against attempts to limit
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care in the eighth
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
circuit and brand B rutage in Arkansas a
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care band was
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
overturned on grounds that it violated
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
the 14th Amendment um on the basis of
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination um as well as in Williams
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
be Kincade in the fourth circuit and
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
they also declared that uh gender

surrounding insurance coverage for
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%

disorder is that your
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria has medically
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate treatment that should be
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%

I do not have a question for the person
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
testifying I have a question for the
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
chair okay all right great thank you for
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you representative
 
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh sharo you could see
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to talk um I I was just
 
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could arrange the
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
people testifying so that we hear um
 
00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519 align:start position:0%
people from Dartmouth Hitchcock if they
 
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
are here to provide testimony earlier
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
because I think hearing from the people
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
who actually provide medical services is
 
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
foundational for all the other um issues
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
that we're going to discuss I have no
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:11.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
sorry as I've said before it's more of
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
an art and a science in terms of
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
arranging the cards but uh no you make a
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%

Dartmouth Health uh Dartmouth Health
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
provides comprehensive quality care to
 
00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:47.559 align:start position:0%

only academic Medical Center we are

Dartmouth Health has provided high
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
quality gender affirming care to both
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%

that supports pediatric and adult
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
patients through transgender um gender
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
transitions we have multidisiplinary
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
teams of doctors nurses social workers
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
and more all of whom are highly skilled
 
00:31:18.629 --> 00:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
and trained all of whom care deeply
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
about their patients and their parents
 
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
um Dartmouth Health has concerns about
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment as introduced today um to
 
00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
represented Weber's point we uh have
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
some concerns that this is um very
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
similar to the bill that we testified in
 
00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
opposition to last legislative session
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
um but there are some differences to
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
representative lon's uh point the first
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
section of this bill or I should say the
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
second after the definition section
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
prohibits a a physician from Prov
 
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
performing gender uh reassignment surger
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
surgery on a patient 17 years or older
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
it also prohibits any physician or
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
Provider from referring a patient um to
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
to um gender reassignment surgeries for
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
example in Boston or another state
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
providers um broadly uh we at Dartmouth
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
Health have a general uh rule that um
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
gen that surgery gender affirming
 
00:32:09.789 --> 00:32:09.799 align:start position:0%
surgery is not per performed on minors
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
however if you turn to um the list of
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
exceptions in the bill I think the list
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
of exceptions in of themselves point to
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
the fact that sometimes there are
 
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
medical necessity there are reasons to
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
have um medical necessity reasons that
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
there would be surgery um I would also
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
note that broadly speaking we there's a
 
00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
um a principle here that we we don't
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
like to legislate medicine these are
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
complex subject matters that are really
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
between a patient and a provider I'm
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
listening to the questions that are
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
asked here today and gosh I certainly
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't answer them I'm not a provider
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
and these these conversations really
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
should be had between a provider and a
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
patient in the in the physician's room I
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
also would like to note that section
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
three prohibits the use of public funds
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
for transgender assignment resurgery
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
including Medicaid reimbursement we
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
really believe believe that this
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
prohibition would drive um further Drive
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
Healthcare inequities um as stated these
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
uh when there are when there is a need
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
to access this type of care they are
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
rare um but they're medically necessary
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
and so um any barriers to to necessary
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
treatment um that is health and Equity
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions um you'll
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
see coming around there's a uh we are
 
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
submitting written testimony on behalf
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
of the health system uh there's a list
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
of providers that illustrate um largely
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
um doctors phys Physicians but nurses
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
social workers um psychologists that are
 
00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this um of this
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you representative
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
chapero yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if you could speak um
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
generally um and specifically to people
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
who who might be pursuing um some kind
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
of surgery um what does what part do
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
parents or Guardians play
 
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:08.599 align:start position:0%
in the involvement with the care of
 
00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
someone 18 and younger um and what part
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
do they play in actually consenting to
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
any treatment for someone under 18 sure
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
so no matter what the type of care is uh
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
we always encourage I'm I'm listening to
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
our um our chair of Department of
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics uh in replaying in my head
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
right now um and he always says that we
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
encourage if not Champion parental
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
involvement in treatment um plan
 
00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:39.079 align:start position:0%
development no matter the type of care
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
whether this is GI care or gender
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
affirming care
 
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
um uh and further it's the it's the law
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
that um parents need to consent to
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
during your testimony that you have a
 
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
principle at Dartmouth that you don't do
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
these kinds of surgeries and people in
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
this age group is did I hear that right
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's our general policy yes and is how
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
was that policy
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
created uh that's a great question I'll
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
have to get back to you on that um but
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
that is a general policy that we have um
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
as created clinically um but I would
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
have to get back to on the details of
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
that it's a great question and is it in
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
writing or is it just a either thing
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
well I mean there are clinical criteria
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
that have to be met for any type of
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
surgery regardless of age and so um
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
those are clinical decisions that have
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
that are made within our department um I
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
have to I'll have to get back to you on
 
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is in writing or not
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
I don't have a copy of it in front of me
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
if there was the decision that this type
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
of surgery needed to be done in somebody
 
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
the age group would that patient be
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
referred out of um the
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
institution it depends if we can provide
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
that care or not um so sometimes we we
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
can provide that care for persons under
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
um eight for persons under 18 17 or
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
younger however it is a very rare
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
exception and I actually think the bill
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
itself highlights a few areas in which
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
that um exception may be may be valid
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
and may be medically
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
necessary representative kushman and
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman um thank
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
you for being here miss Tanner um can
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
you tell me what your medical specialty
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
is I do not have a medical specialty I'm
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
an attorney by training and I have a
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
masters in social work thank you may
 
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
have a follow follow up um okay so if we
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
should be hearing from providers from
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock for these technical
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
questions um is why was no one sent from
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth so our providers are in our
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
providers are in clinic today and
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
they're unable to be here that's why
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
they have me okay and one FR one one one
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
more yeah would you it's my
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
understanding that um all medical
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
facilities per New Hampshire statute
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
have to have um written and printed um
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures for their
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
practice um so I'm assuming that
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth has written guidelines on when
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
this would be okay for um anyone under
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
18 and when it would not and what the
 
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines are would you be able to get
 
00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
us those policies and proed as I stated
 
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
to representative Nel I'm happy to
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
Circle back on that certainly thank you
 
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
you m gney taking the T Tanner for
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
taking the question courney is fine in
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
regards to following up on represent
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
Nel's um the policy it says here on your
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
letter as well that the organization
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
does not include gender firming
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
surgeries for transgender miners does it
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
also exclude in the policy for a
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
provider to make a referral that's
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
question one if you will and then number
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
two does Dartmouth Hitchcock know of any
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
other policy you have that prohibits a
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
provider from making any other kind of
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
referral so two questions do you have a
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
policy specifically prohibiting a
 
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
provider from making that referral and
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
do you have any other policies with any
 
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
other prohibitions on referrals so I'm
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
going to take those questions down as I
 
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
Circle back with um other policies
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
forthcoming um but I'll say that
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
referrals are made only when medically
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
necessary so um yeah I would just leave
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
it at
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
that representative ma thank you Mr
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
so correct me if I'm wrong but you said
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
what are those um you mentioned medical
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
NE Necessities is that medical
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
Necessities that warrant surgery or what
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
were medical Necessities that warrant
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
what well every patient is different
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
right and every um every clinical case
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
needs something different and so it's
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
really hard for me to answer a general
 
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:14.839 align:start position:0%
question like that when every patient's
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
going to need something different from
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
their provider and again I think that
 
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
that really points to that these
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
conversations have to be happening
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
between a patient and a
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
provider did you have a follow-up
 
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
representative yeah so
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
just to clarify though are you saying
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
that if there medical Necessities would
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
warrant surgery at Dartmouth
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock like what and what if so what
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
kind of medical Necessities is are
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
those so again I think that those
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
conversations have to be happening
 
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
between a provider and and their patient
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
and is it a yes is yes or no is I well I
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not understanding the question
 
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
to be a yes or no question yes so
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
is surgery done at Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
in the case of a medical necessity it's
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
our general rule that surgery is not
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
performed on minors um for gender
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
affirming care however there are rare
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions when they're medically
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
necessary what are those
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions that has to be that has to be
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
decided on between a patient and a
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
provider would it be fair to say Case by
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
case absolutely absolutely as requested
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
before can you send us a list of those
 
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
exceptions will work on providing the
 
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
the written policy thank you
 
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
Palmer so in that
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
vein one of the things that I'd also be
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
is I don't know how you can make a list
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
of every possible exception that needs
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
to be made um and so because even if you
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
get all of the best surgeons best
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
doctors best providers of this kind of
 
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
care there's going to be the next case
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
that shows up that doesn't fit that
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
criteria absolutely and so I guess my
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
question is would the physicians at
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth be nervous about having just a
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
specific list of exceptions and if it if
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's not on the
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
list what happens yes absolutely and and
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
also that c care is innovative right so
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
um I think again as I stated earlier the
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
the list of exceptions in this bill
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
alone illustrates that there are times
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
where it's clinically roate um however
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
we know we move slow in our in this
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
realm of the world and so it's really
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous to legislate medicine this
 
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
way other questions from committee
 
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is James

was I

on good morning to the committee chair

psychologist in New Hampshire and work
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
as a forensic psychologist here uh I
 
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire and so I am one
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
of those people who has started to build
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
my life and and find a place here in New
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I represent the New
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Psychological Association uh
 
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
which is a professional organization of
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
over 200 psychologists active in
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire right now uh
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I am here today to speak on behalf
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
of that organization in opposition to
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
this amendment and this
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
legislation uh specifically uh the New
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire psychological psychological
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
associ Association was an organization
 
00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:00.559 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh eager to contribute to the ban on
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy in 2018 and to make
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
sure that those practices would not be
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
allowed in this state uh it is unclear
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
to me why uh the uh sponsors of this
 
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
bill have uh alluded to some sort of
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
conflation between gender affirming care
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
which is a uh category of services
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
provided by medical uh provid ERS who
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
are licensed in the state and uh subject
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
to the board uh of medicine uh and con
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
and uh conversion therapy which is
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
a a uh unfounded
 
00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:45.559 align:start position:0%
unscientific practice that seeks to uh
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
impose the wills of parents and and
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
adults on minors uh there is
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
no uh similarity between these two
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
practices and so to conf plate them in
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
this bill as the as there appears to be
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
an attempt to uh just does not make
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
sense to me or the members of my
 
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
organization who I
 
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.549 align:start position:0%
organization who I
represent

00:44:05.549 --> 00:44:05.559 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a psychologist I'm not a medical
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
provider I can speak to uh mental health
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
issues that appear uh as a result of uh
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria and that gender
 
00:44:19.549 --> 00:44:19.559 align:start position:0%
affirming care is a good solution for
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
those individuals who are uh struggling
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
with gender sephoria that this is a uh
 
00:44:28.829 --> 00:44:28.839 align:start position:0%
this is an emerging area of care I agree
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
with the sponsors of the build that is
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
the case um however that would then in
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
my mind beg the question of why at this
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
early stage are we choosing to ban this
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
procedure which is not the same thing as
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy there is no
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
legitimate purpose for conversion
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
therapy there is no scientific evidence
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
that it could work um that is not the
 
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
case with gender affirming care or any
 
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
of the things that may be falling under
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
that umbrella
 
00:44:58.589 --> 00:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm here basically to ask to
 
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
answer questions uh on the mental health
 
00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
front if you guys have questions I'm
 
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:05.720 align:start position:0%
happy to try to address them okay thank
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
chair so when we um heard
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
testimony a year or two ago about um
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
another bill which was going to um
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
repeal the ban on conversion therapy
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
we heard um some forceful testimony from
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
a very limited number of um clinicians
 
00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
who said that the statute as it now is
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if you're familiar with
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
the actual wording of the statute as it
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
currently reads that the that the
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
wording would um
 
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.470 align:start position:0%
wording would um
discourage

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
discourage
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
clinicians um from talking to adolescen
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
about sexuality about their questions
 
00:45:59.470 --> 00:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
about sexuality about their discomfort
 
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:02.559 align:start position:0%
um so that it would um discourage
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
General discussion with um youth which I
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
think we would all agree is really
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
important so from your practice or from
 
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
your ideas representing this American
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association New Hampshire
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association would you
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
think the current statute would
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
discourage people from talking to
 
00:46:21.559 --> 00:46:22.910 align:start position:0%
discourage people from talking to
adolescence

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
adolescence
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
about um sexual concerns uh in my
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
opinion no uh my organization is not
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
aware of any individuals who have come
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
to us and said that they have had board
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
complaints or have had clients come to
 
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
them with concerns about uh discussions
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
General about uh sexual uh orientation
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
or gender identity um in my uh
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
understanding there there haven't been
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
any board complaints in the four years
 
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh based on on on this uh change to to
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
the legislation uh and there's always
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
going to be a small minority of uh
 
00:47:06.549 --> 00:47:06.559 align:start position:0%
providers who
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
will be willing to allow their
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
professional uh demeanor to be
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
influenced by political attitudes uh
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
part of the nice thing about working for
 
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
an organization that represents hundreds
 
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
of psychologists is that we get a wide
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
variety of of perspectives and and opin
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
and histories and again our organization
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
as a whole we have people who come
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
forward and say that we are supporting
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
this ban as it is currently written we
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
came forth in 2020 to maintain our
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
support for that bill and we continue
 
00:47:40.589 --> 00:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
our support for that consistent ban on
 
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so is it NE
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
necessary for us to um legislate the
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
practice of around psychology wouldn't
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
this um wouldn't conversion therapy
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
already be um you know against the
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
principles and the ethics guidelines and
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules for
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
psychologists in New Hampshire without
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
the language that's currently in
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
question part of the difficulty with
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy and the necessity for
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
a ban for it was that it was often not
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
something that was advertised or
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
publicly uh offered uh but something
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
that was done uh
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
through Less open
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
means uh so you had providers who had
 
00:48:42.599 --> 00:48:43.750 align:start position:0%
means uh so you had providers who had
unclear

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
unclear
 
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
certifications who had um uh facilities
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
that may or may not be uh within good
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
standing in terms of their ability to
 
00:48:55.789 --> 00:48:55.799 align:start position:0%
provide care for people uh and so there
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
was less clarity about who was going to
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
be providing this this practice and
 
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not they would be accountable
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
to a board uh so in this case a ban was
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
a reasonable effort to try to make sure
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
that no one can can provide these
 
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
Services whether or not they are
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
licensed and uh that contrasts with
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care which is uniformly
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
practiced in by people who have medical
 
00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:23.799 align:start position:0%
licenses uh and so again I don't see the
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
comparison between the two
 
00:49:26.839 --> 00:49:27.950 align:start position:0%
comparison between the two
follow

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:49:33.309 --> 00:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
up okay thank you and um I'm just
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
that I apologize
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
can't any other questions uh
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative mour thank you thank you
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so do you
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
think guidance counselors and schools
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
are able to appropriately counsel
 
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
children who are experiencing gender
 
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
dysphoria uh
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
I would say yes or no it would depend on
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
the case uh there are certainly going to
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
be individuals who uh would need a low
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
level of care me the vast majority of
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
folks who experience some questions
 
00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
about their gender identity um are going
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
to be sort of just questioning having a
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
low level of Interest or or curiosity um
 
00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
for those folks who need uh more
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
intensive care they're likely going to
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
need a higher level of services and it
 
00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:25.799 align:start position:0%
would depend on the qualifications of
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
the guidance counselor in that school to
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
recognize whether or not they have the
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications and training appropriate
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
to offer those services or to refer that
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
to a more trained and specialized
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
provider yeah you have a followup yep
 
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
um yes so do you receive a lot of
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
referrals from guidance counselors and
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
schools for that then uh my organization
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
represents uh
 
00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.549 align:start position:0%
represents uh
psychologists

00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
psychologists
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
um and I am not acting as a clinical
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
psychologist in my own practice as I
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
said at the beginning I am a forensic
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
psychologist working with the criminal
 
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
justice system uh I can tell you that my
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh who I've spoken with have
 
00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:08.839 align:start position:0%
not had a have not reported a large
 
00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
counselors but I can follow up with uh
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
with my colleagues and see if if there
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
have been uh more referrals that they
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
haven't discussed with me
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
personally representative Weber and then

thanks for your patience um I'm
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
wondering going back to you were
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
discussing that there would be those um
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
Fly by Night operations that are um
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
engaging in conversion therapy um
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
are those are those kinds of operations
 
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
violating Licensing Laws at that point
 
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
if they're practicing psychology but
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
licensed again it would depend on the
 
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances of that individual
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
operation um there have been uh there
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
have been situations I believe I'm aware
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
of where uh they have employed people
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
who have had some sort of medical
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
license or who have had uh affiliated
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
health license um but again
 
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking based on my own you know
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
reading of of newspaper stories and and
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
at this point so I can't speak to any
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
specific uh one of these operations I've
 
00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
only been aware from testimonials people
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
who have been who have lived experiences
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
when they've talked about their
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
experiences there uh talking about the
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh operators of these facilities not
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily having the appropriate
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
lure representative Missour thank you

reassignment surgery for minors when it
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
is medically indicated and there has
 
00:53:01.789 --> 00:53:01.799 align:start position:0%

2023
 
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
2359 and HB 619 itself I'll keep my
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
comments simple as we've heard from a
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
lot of professionals and I think we have
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
more in the bank and again sir the focus
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
of this hearing is on the amendment at
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
yes of
 
00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
course Nomine Hampshire believes that
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
all people should be treated with
 
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
respect and dignity and should have
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
access to mental and physical healthare
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
free from interference as a result of
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
stigma and discrimination lgbtq plus
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
individuals especially those who are
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
transgender or gender non-conforming are
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
often at an elevated risk for
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
experiencing anxiety and depression
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
however Nami New Hampshire recognizes
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
that with access to affirming health
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
care and support within their homes and
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
communities this risk can be avoided
 
00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
simply put gender affirming care works
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
it's saves lives and enhances the
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
well-being of those who need it
 
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
therefore we oppose any harmful policies
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
targeting lgbtq plus individuals such as
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
the limit on gender firm care in section
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
one of this amendment we also remain
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
firm in our opposition of the harmful
 
00:55:10.589 --> 00:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
practice of conversion therapy and
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
oppose any policies that may enable its
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
use in our opinion section two of this
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
amendment would soften the statutory
 
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
definition of conversion therapy
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
increasing the risk of this practice
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
being used against lgbtq plus
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
individuals when they seek affirming
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
mental health care for those reasons I
 
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:28.839 align:start position:0%
ask you to please oppose Amendment 2023

00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:52.839 align:start position:0%
welcome um I just I appreciate what
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
you're doing here I think it's a really
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
really good job I want to say that to
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
begin with I just wanted to talk about a
 
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
couple make a couple points one is
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
um I like your definition the fact that
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
you defined gender and sex because while
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
we can change our gender we can't change
 
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
our sex because it's written into every
 
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
single one of the cells in our
 
00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:22.950 align:start position:0%
single one of the cells in our
system

00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
and one thing I wanted to point out
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about surgery but I did
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
want to point out that hormones which
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
are often done in conjunction with all
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
of this if you have hormones of the
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
opposite sex they are um toxic to your
 
00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:45.559 align:start position:0%
system and while we as legislators
 
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be mandating what people can
 
00:57:52.109 --> 00:57:52.119 align:start position:0%
and can adults can and can't do um it is
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
our respon it is I think our duty to to
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
at least help protect people from
 
00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
malpractice and there is nothing in here
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
but I would like to see something if
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
it's possible that says if somebody is
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to be doing that they have to
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
State and get signed an understanding of
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
the patient of all of the risks whether
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
it's the surgery or whether it's the
 
00:58:20.109 --> 00:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
hormones and other things that go with
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
it because I think I have met a number
 
00:58:25.029 --> 00:58:25.039 align:start position:0%
of people who have gone through through
 
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
this and they did not they were not
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
informed of all of the potential risks
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that's very important and
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
then the other part um I wanted to talk
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
about the counseling and I am thrilled
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
to see that you are making it
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
specific that General counseling that is
 
00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.190 align:start position:0%
specific that General counseling that is
not

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
compelling um is allowed because I have
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
spoken to counselors who felt that they
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
were not allowed to do any type of
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
counseling to um people with gender
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
dysphoria because of the law The Way It
 
00:59:01.599 --> 00:59:02.390 align:start position:0%
dysphoria because of the law The Way It
Was

00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
Was
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
Written and a number of people if not
 
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
the majority of people who have gender
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
dysphoria have underlying issues be it
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
trauma or other things that it's very
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
important that they get proper
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
counseling for and I have spoken again
 
00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:22.839 align:start position:0%
to various people who have transitioned
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
who did not get that counseling
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
because the counselors were afraid that
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
that would be disobeying the law the way
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's written now so I really appreciate
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
that you've opened that up and I hope
 
00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
you will continue to support that so
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
that people can get the counseling that
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
they need to particularly exploring what
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
the underlying issues may be that they
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%

uh transgender youth uh queer and
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
questioning youth having higher rates of
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
of depression it's not intrinsic within
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
the person who is
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
uh questioning their gender questioning
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
their sexuality to be depressed it is
 
01:01:17.309 --> 01:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
uh more an outcropping of the way
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
Society treats people who are
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
questioning or uh or a transgender as
 
01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
far as
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
the conversion therapy and that's a
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
misname there's nothing therapeutic
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
about this practice it is dangerous it
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
is harmful it is hurtful and years ago
 
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
when we got this band I I at first
 
01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:44.839 align:start position:0%
wondered whether or not it was a
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
solution looking for a problem until I
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
heard the testimony of
 
01:01:53.069 --> 01:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people who had been affected
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
and then also hearing from social
 
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
workers and psychologists and other
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals saying yes
 
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
I've had to treat people who had been
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
victims of this practice it is fine the
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
way it is written there were a few
 
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
people when they tried to overturn the
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
ban who were confused about what
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
about if it's not within your scope of
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
practice to do that work to work with
 
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
people who are uh questioning their
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
sexuality or or gender
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
identity then they need to refer them to
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
somebody who it is within their scope of
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
practice please leave the conversion
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
therapy ban alone it is
 
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
fine I'll I'll sum up my my testimony
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%

Merchant
 
01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
taking the
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
question during your testimony you refer
 
01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:02.039 align:start position:0%
to the external environment which is
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
basically Society versus the internal
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
one which is the
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
individual in saying that is there
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
any documentation or studies out there
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
in societies that are more accepting of
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
this practice and that impact it has on
 
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
depression I'm trying to get to is that
 
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
are the countries that are more
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
accepting therefore the individual has
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
less depression than we would find here
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
in the United States I I think we thank
 
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
you for the question and I'm happy to
 
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
find that research I think we can
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
extrapolate from what we're seeing right
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
now with some states that are you know
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
the don't say gay bills or Banning uh
 
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care outright the
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
numbers of suicide attempts
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
and the number of suicides has dumped
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
dramatically I can't say that this is a
 
01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
causal relationship but I'm it sure
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
sounds like a very strong correlation
 
01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that the research will
 
01:04:08.269 --> 01:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
start to meet it out in the next few
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
years other
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative Missour thank
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
could you please send us those stats
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
that you just said it sounded a little
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
bit like conjecture to me but if you
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
have exact St stats that say these
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
suicides are a result of this I would
 
01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
love to see that yeah that's why I said
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
I I'm not saying that there's a so
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%

988 and the other suicide uh uh projects
 
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:44.599 align:start position:0%

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%

01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
organization not to speak okay on them
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
follow follow up um well they Define
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy as attempts to compel
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
a gender diverse child through words
 
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
actions or both to identify with or
 
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
behave in accordance with the gender

associated with the sex assigned at
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
Birth do you um agree that that's a
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
solid and appropriate definition for
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy that's their
 
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
definition of of conversion therapy what
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
that conversion therapy is unethical for
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
any medical
 
01:06:05.559 --> 01:06:07.069 align:start position:0%
any medical
or

01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:06:07.079 --> 01:06:08.670 align:start position:0%
or
uh

01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
behavioral health
 
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
professional in New Hampshire all of the
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
other New England states New York New
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
Jersey and go out a little further it's
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
illegal it is a practice
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
that looks different depending on where
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we need to go further
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
than what we already have in our ban on
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy follow up um okay but
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
you see where that's problematic where
 
01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:46.839 align:start position:0%
we deal with law and we need solid
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
definitions how can we prohibit
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
something if we can't Define
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
it I think we did Define it in the
 
01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:58.109 align:start position:0%
it I think we did Define it in the
original

01:06:58.109 --> 01:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
law okay any other questions from
 
01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.390 align:start position:0%
law okay any other questions from
committee

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%

01:07:14.349 --> 01:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Chris
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
glad good morning good morning thank you
 
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you members of the committee
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
good few minutes my name is Chris urel
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I am with glad in Boston but I'm a
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire licensed
 
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
attorney I also have um extensive
 
01:07:39.549 --> 01:07:39.559 align:start position:0%
experience litigating uh in the area of
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
access to health care for transgender
 
01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
people including transgender
 
01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:46.839 align:start position:0%
minors um I'm going to rush through a
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
few points because three minutes isn't
 
01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
long to cover all this material um as
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard it is exceedingly rare that
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
anyone under the age of 18 ever has uh
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
has the kind of surgeries that are
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
prohibited in this uh Bill and in fact I
 
01:08:04.109 --> 01:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
do have anecdotal um information about
 
01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
those extremely rare cases if people
 
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
want to hear but I do want to point out
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
that only four between 2016 and 2020
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
only 405 surgeries of the type defined
 
01:08:16.829 --> 01:08:16.839 align:start position:0%
in here were performed on people 18
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
years old and younger and that includes
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
18year olds the majority of those people
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
were 18y olds so we are talking about a
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
very very small number of uh surgeries
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
and the only place where I know anywhere
 
01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
near here is Boston Children's Hospital
 
01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
um where a surgery like that has ever
 
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
taken place and it is very rare even
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
there and I can talk more about that if
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
people have questions about it um I just
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
want to add though that in those
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which it's medically
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
indicated it is very very important for
 
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
those people to have access to the
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
healthare that they need it's not it's
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
not for any reason other than Medical
 
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
necess necessity that a 17-year-old
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
would ever go through a procedure like
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
that um and again I'm happy to talk more
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
if people have questions about it uh
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the uh prohibition on
 
01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage I just want to point
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
out that it is pretty unusual for the
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
legislature to prohibit private
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
insurance uh private insurance companies
 
01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
from providing benefits to people um of
 
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
any kind uh that's a very very rare to
 
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
see in any kind of legislation and it uh
 
01:09:22.349 --> 01:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
kind of raises my eyebrows that that
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
that there's an effort you know
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
prohibiting certain practices is one
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
thing but then making a law that would
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
prohibit a private insurance company
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
from providing health benefits to an
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
individual is uh is is a step that goes
 
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit beyond um there's another
 
01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
part of this bill that would um that
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
would that would uh insulate insurance
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
companies that didn't want to provide
 
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
coverage from um for gender transition
 
01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
related Medical Care and I just want to
 
01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
point out that that conflicts not only
 
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
with several New Hampshire statutes as
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
we've already heard it also uh conflicts
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire division of
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
Insurance's stated policy and it conf
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
conflicts with Section 1557 of the
 
01:10:02.669 --> 01:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act which prohibits
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination on the basis of
 
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
transgender status in health benefits um
 
01:10:11.229 --> 01:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps most alarming about this bill is
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh the um the the proposed amendments to
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
the ban on conversion therapy um as
 
01:10:19.709 --> 01:10:19.719 align:start position:0%
we've heard Professionals in Med Medical
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
Care Mental Health Care Professionals do
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
not have trouble complying with with the
 
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
ban on conversion therapy it is not
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
confusing to them I would look with a
 
01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
lot of Suspicion on any mental health
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
care provider who stated otherwise I do
 
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
want to point out that many states
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
besides New Hampshire including States
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
in New England and Beyond use exactly
 
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
the same language uh uh you know all you
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
have to do is a Google search practices
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
or treatments that seek to change an
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
individual sexual orientation or gender
 
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
identity it's very well understood you
 
01:10:50.669 --> 01:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
can pleas start wrapping up yeah yeah
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that a lot of the points
 
01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
in the um conversion therapy amendments
 
01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
reflect a fundamental misunderstanding
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
of gender identity no um with all due
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
respect to the drafters and I'm happy to
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
address any of the issues that I just
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
raised in more detail um so please feel
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
free to ask questions thank you
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.149 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
representative

01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you uh and thank you for
 
01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you for being
 
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
here today um I would indeed uh be very
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing more elaboration
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
on the issue of the conversion therapy
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
language yeah thank you so um I really
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question um so a
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
person's gender identity is not
 
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
something that can be changed it is
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
fixed from a very young age that's what
 
01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
experts in the field have told us and so
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
what the bill suggests is that
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
counselors can transition or
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
detransition somebody according to their
 
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
wishes and the whole point of the banon
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy is to make it clear
 
01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
that that is not possible what can
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
change and what does change is a
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
person's understanding of their gender
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
identity that changes over time that is
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
where a mental health provider can come
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
in and provide invaluable support to
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
someone who's seeking to understand
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
their gender identity um the word d
 
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
transition shows up in the amendment uh
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
which is just uh it's not a term of art
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's not a term that medical Mental
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals will use to
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
describe uh to describe a anything
 
01:12:19.149 --> 01:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
gender transition is a process that
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes takes many turns and uh
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
because because understanding a person's
 
01:12:24.669 --> 01:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
gender identity can be really difficult
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons that I could you
 
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
know go into for hours talking about why
 
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
it's so hard for some young people
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
especially to understand their gender
 
01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
identity so the fact that the word d
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
transition um shows up in here the fact
 
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about how um how a
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
how a provider can provide counseling
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
that changes a person's gender identity
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
this is not possible a person's gender
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
identity is fixed and a mental health
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
care provider can provide invaluable
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
support in helping a person understand
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
that um and that can involve helping a
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
person with social transition helping a
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
person work through issues related to
 
01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
Medical transition and more but a
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
person's gender identity cannot be
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
changed and I just want to make sure
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely clear um but that's
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
not what the language of uh part C
 
01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.270 align:start position:0%
not what the language of uh part C
suggests

01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
suggests
 
01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
followup it's actually not a follow-up
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
it's a whole new question if I may sure
 
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing you you uh touched on
 
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
but did not go into deeply um is uh the
 
01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
issue of People who have actually had
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
the surgery at a younger age and the
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
necessity which I think you
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
characterized as a very deep necessity
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
medical necessity and I wish if you
 
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
could explain those um needs a little
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
bit more that would be helpful sure sure
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
I'm actually pretty familiar with a
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
specific court case which um because the
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
case is impounded because it involves a
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
minor I don't want to go into too much
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
detail describing it to un um to you
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
know uncover
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know private information about
 
01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
people and their um and their intimate
 
01:13:59.310 --> 01:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
details of their lives but but there is
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
a 17-year-old who um who who needed
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
surgery and I just want to say the
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
hospital where the surgery was performed
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh they would not perform it without a
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
court order so they asked uh the family
 
01:14:14.669 --> 01:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
to file a lawsuit in court seeking a
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
judgment declaring that the hospital
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
must perform or has you know the legal
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
right to perform this surgery um and in
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
those in in this particular and doal
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
circumstance that I can share with you
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
there are some really important
 
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
characteristic things that I've heard in
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
other cases too uh first that the person
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh it was a transgender girl because as
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
as as repon has noted it's only
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
vaginoplasty that's performed on anyone
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
who's 17 years old um she was a
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
transgender girl who had been out you
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
know living as living as a girl from a
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
very very young age okay she was on her
 
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
way to college and experiencing severe
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria due to her due to the
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
fact that her body did not conform to
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
her gender ident identity uh she was
 
01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
about to go to college and she had one
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity one opportunity where she
 
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
could be in the care of her mother and
 
01:15:03.149 --> 01:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
father in their home while recovering
 
01:15:05.629 --> 01:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
from a very serious surgery before going
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
off and going to college where she was
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
going to then be uh you know in front of
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
her peers and in front of everybody else
 
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
without the protection and so she wanted
 
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
to be she needed to be uh secure in who
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
she was and in her body before she went
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
to college it's a very rare circumstance
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
that somebody is in this uh this
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
situation of need but um if you if you
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
knew the girl if you knew the
 
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances you would understand
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
completely why it was medical necess
 
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
medically necessary in that specific
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
case but again very rare that it's ever
 
01:15:33.639 --> 01:15:35.910 align:start position:0%
case but again very rare that it's ever
medically

01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
medically
 
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
question during the testimony what I
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
heard I think I heard was between the
 
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
years of 2016 and
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
2020 there were 4 such surgeries
 
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
45 and you talked about that was
 
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
including 18 and 17 what would be
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
interesting do we have any data about
 
01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:12.679 align:start position:0%
how many of those were 17 and in the
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can tell you that uh I wish
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
that there were the data splitting out
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
how many were 18 and 17 what I believe
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
is that the study that I was where I got
 
01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
this information which I can provide to
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
the committee later um I believe what I
 
01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
what I Intuit it is that they needed a
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
you know a number of sample size that
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
was large enough to perform any kind of
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
analysis so they needed to include 18y
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
olds they couldn't just look at 17y olds
 
01:16:39.149 --> 01:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
right so I don't have that breakdown
 
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and I and I wish I knew
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
who did right um but uh how many people
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
from who are residents of the State of
 
01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and had that surgery in
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think the answer is zero
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
and then I think if you were to ask how
 
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
many people who are residents of the
 
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire um and had the
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
surgery elsewhere it is um probably
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
zero so the ones that don't qualify for
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
zero would they done again back to it
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's one Hospital in the
 
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
New England here in Boston Children's
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
Hospital is it their policy that in
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
order for them to perform the surgery
 
01:17:18.669 --> 01:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
they require a court order um in that
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
one particular case they did and um and
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
I actually don't know if that happened
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
to be the first time that that ever
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
happened or not for that hospital but um
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
presuming it was it was in 2019 you know
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh Missour and
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
then representative Weber yes thank you
 
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um are you
 
01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
familiar have you read the W path
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
standard of care and are you familiar
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
with W path I'm very familiar with W
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
path I've read I haven't read every
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
everything and all the standards of care
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
they're pretty expansive so yeah okay
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I have another follow up um so
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
so is a d transitioner someone who
 
01:17:58.990 --> 01:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
detransitioned um are they Contin do
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
they continue to experience gender
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
disphoria uh I would tend to use the
 
01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
term someone who desists from uh and
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
then I would say either desists from
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
social transition or desists from um um
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
from from you know taking hormones or or
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
or something along those lines I
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't use the term detransition if I
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
were talking professionally because I
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a professional term but
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
yeah they call themselves that but okay
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
well I mean I think you'll find some
 
01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
people who do and some people who say I
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
desisted from treatment and uh or I
 
01:18:31.709 --> 01:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
desisted from social transition right so
 
01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
one quick yep would the surgery then be
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
considered necessary or successful in
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
those situations um can you please
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
clarify the question so if a if a person
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
who has transitioned MH you know has
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
gotten surgery MH and then decides to
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
detransition was that surgery considered
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
as a success I mean I think the question
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
is does that individual regret the
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
surgery right and um yeah there are rare
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
instances in which people have uh gender
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
gender uh gender transition related
 
01:19:03.149 --> 01:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
surgeries and regret them and that's
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
really unfortunate and in fact um you
 
01:19:08.189 --> 01:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
know medical standards of care must be
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
established in such a way to minimize uh
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
the level of regret I will uh note that
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
compared to other surgical interventions
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
um regret rates for gender transition
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
surgeries are lower um and and um and of
 
01:19:25.709 --> 01:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
course uh as everyone should everyone
 
01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
should have the right to exercise um um
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
you know uh exercise their rights
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
against any medical professional who
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
does not comply with the standards of
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
care when providing treatment and that's
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
why we have really robust uh medical
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
malpractice uh standards and laws in New
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and everywhere in the
 
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
country representative
 
01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you my my question was
 
01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
actually just a followup with respect to
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
the 405 surgery between 2016 and 2020
 
01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I wrote down what the
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
geographical area those were in that was
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
the United States I apologize if I
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
didn't that was the whole United the
 
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
whole United States the whole United
 
01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
States for for those for those years
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
those five
 
01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
years and a followup just a quick
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
followup would you believe that I very
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
much regret having parted with my uula
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
to treat sleep app
 
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
Nia I would believe it thank
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
you would you further believe that I was
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
informed that it might not help and I
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
chose to do it anyway thank
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
you I would believe that yes other
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
01:20:42.189 --> 01:20:42.199 align:start position:0%
Canon we we we've talked a bit about
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
detransitioning do you are you aware of
 
01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:47.719 align:start position:0%
um any numbers associate with people
 
01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
that have dis have detransitioned who
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
have transitioned back oh I do know that
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
I mean I know anecdotally of situations
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
in which that happen sometimes someone
 
01:20:59.310 --> 01:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
will transition to living socially as
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
another gender and I just want to point
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
out while we're talking about
 
01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
detransition or desisting um that there
 
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
is um a number of reasons that a person
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
might detransition and might include
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
regret it might include um it might
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
include you know uh a person coming to
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
terms with understanding that their
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria wasn't telling them
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
what they thought it was telling them
 
01:21:19.229 --> 01:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
and it might involve somebody who said
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
the social pressures that come along
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
with living as a different gender are
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
actually much much greater than I was
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
prepared for either because uh my
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
personal transition story didn't allow
 
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
me to uh to assimilate as well as I
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
thought I could or because I just
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
experienced so much discrimination you
 
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
know I I hear a number of stories from
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
all you know all aspects including
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
regret but but I just want to point out
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
that it's a really wide range and yes
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes people um on their journey of
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
you know understanding their gender
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
identity might transition and then might
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
detransition or trans you know
 
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
transition back and then might
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
transition back again and then sometimes
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
people will discover that they have a
 
01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
non-binary gender identity but they
 
01:21:59.790 --> 01:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
weren't necessarily open to that
 
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
possibility at an earlier age there's so
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
many different you know paths that a
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
person might take and I think it's
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
really important to ensure that
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
everybody has the right and ability and
 
01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
all the tools that they need to help
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
find out how to live as comfortably as
 
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
they can in their gender
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
identity other questions representative
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
ma thank you again um yeah so I when
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.430 align:start position:0%
ma thank you again um yeah so I when
someone

01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
wants to de detransition do you know
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
what the billing codes for that standard
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
of care would be again uh the the
 
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
medical treatment wouldn't be considered
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
D transition it would be considered
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
transition related care it would be
 
01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
considered gender transition related
 
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
care for somebody to either desist
 
01:22:43.629 --> 01:22:43.639 align:start position:0%
taking hormones or for somebody to have
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
other surgical treatments or anything
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
else so is is that a fact or opinion
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
because I have heard the opposite that
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
there are billing codes for
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
transitioning and so would you agree
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
that in in another state next door to us
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
there would not be billing codes for
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
those who choose to transition D
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
transition well I are you talking about
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
surg surgical treatment specifically all
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
of it all of it okay
 
01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
so billing codes associated with a
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
specific hor I mean okay I'm not an
 
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
insurance expert but I think that we're
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
talking about some really really
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
complicated stuff here when you know a
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
person who is prescribed hormone therapy
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
the billing code I think is associated
 
01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
with the medication not with a diagnosis
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
or what it's intended to treat right and
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
I think that's true generally for um
 
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
surgical treatments as well um but there
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
there are certainly going to be um
 
01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
instances in which a surgical treatment
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
will be Associated only with gender
 
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
transition so I I just think that it's
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
like a really complicated question
 
01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
that's beyond beyond the scope of this
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
amendment for sure representative
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
for being here and taking my question um
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
I think the Crux of the issue that
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative Missour was trying to get
 
01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
to is that that it's difficult to track
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
um a lot of times people who no longer
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
want to continue on their path to
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
transition to um the different gender
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
that they were born um end up ghosting
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
the clinic that they used to go to and
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
just get off the hormones on their own
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there's no follow-up care and
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
there's no post care um
 
01:24:18.669 --> 01:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
surveillance and so we have a couple of
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
studies um you know we've got like 11
 
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
studies today that show that if children
 
01:24:25.629 --> 01:24:25.639 align:start position:0%
aren't affirmed and there's watchful
 
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
waiting that um the vast majority the
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria resolves and then we
 
01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
have other studies um the most recent
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
and large one published in 2021 followed
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
139 boys from 7 to 21 years old and
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
showed that as adults um 87% grew
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
outgrew their gender dysphoria so we
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the stats on regret but we do
 
01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
have the stats on um you know change uh
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
out growing the dysphoria to an extent
 
01:24:57.629 --> 01:24:57.639 align:start position:0%
but you see the problem with the billing
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
codes do you you see how that could lend
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
to it seeming like there's a lot less
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
detransitioning than is uh
 
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
pervy um may I suggest that if this
 
01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:11.719 align:start position:0%
committee and this legislature are
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
concerned with the availability of
 
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
competent care for people who wish to
 
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
desist from gender transition that uh
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
that legislation um be enacted to the
 
01:25:24.270 --> 01:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
healthare options available to those
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
individuals I think that would be a
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
fantastic use of this legislature's
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
resources in
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
time follow up well wouldn't it be um
 
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
effective to
 
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
also pass this legislation and then
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
prevent those horrible regret cases from
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
occurring in the first place if you're
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting that it was better to prevent
 
01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
people from getting healthare that they
 
01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
need because there might be a small
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
percentage of the people who get it who
 
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
end up regretting the healthare that
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
they need then I would disagree with
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
you let's move on um any other questions
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
for this U
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
person seeing no other questions thank
 
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%

under the desk okay thank you I can see
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%

619 I have met and heard the stories
 
01:27:04.510 --> 01:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
from many D transitioners the M vast
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
majority who are girls who have deep
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
regret for the rible damage to their
 
01:27:12.189 --> 01:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
bodies girls who are confused about
 
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
their gender and many who also have
 
01:27:18.109 --> 01:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
comorbid serious mental health health
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
problems such as autism
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
ADHD and PTs are being led down the path
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
of medical transitions starting with pu
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers followed by cross- seex
 
01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
hormones and finally having their
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
healthy body parts
 
01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
removed with girls this means most often
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
means radical double mastectomies
 
01:27:43.709 --> 01:27:43.719 align:start position:0%
leaving large painful scars and taking
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
away the sexual function of the breast
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
and the ability to breastfeed their
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
babies the pain from the scars and from
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
Phantom breast syndrome
 
01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
can be lifelong these girls don't have a
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
grasp on what they are giving up and
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
what physical problems they are taking
 
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
on there's no reason to rush these
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
procedures when these girls have so much
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
at stake and can make a decision for
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
surgery later in life when they have the
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
life experience and the Brain
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
development to make these
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
decisions this amendment would not only
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
protect children from lifelong regret it
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
would also protect medical providers who
 
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
risk being the target of
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
lawsuits numerous lawsuits have been
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
brought by D transitioners against their
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
medical providers for medically

most important developmental period I
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
was butchered by an institution that we
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
trust more than anything else in our
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%

members representative kushman thank you

Mr chairman thank you for being here uh
 
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the lawsuit filed
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
by Isabella aella in uh Rhode Island
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
recently yeah can are you able to tell
 
01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:16.280 align:start position:0%
us a little bit about that um from what
 
01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
I read um she's not only suing the
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
clinician who um led her and supported
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
her in her gender uh transition
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
experience but also the American Academy
 
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
of Pediatrics for fraud for their
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines that were issued in
 
01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
2018 um and the studies that um that are
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
cited as supporting those guidelines as
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
being uh fraudulent and not proving what
 
01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
they say to proove Excuse excuse me
 
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
representative n do you have a point of
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
order I believe I do I thought we could
 
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
ask questions of a testimony not
 
01:30:58.510 --> 01:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
introduce completely new testimony which
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh if representative kushman wanted to
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
present testimony maybe she should fill
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
out a card and get in line she was
 
01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
talking about lawsuits so I wanted to
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
ask her seemed a little farfetched to me
 
01:31:12.149 --> 01:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
but I
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
just I'm not
 
01:31:17.109 --> 01:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
debating the I'm just the
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of my inter was she was
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
just trying to find out if the witness
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
was aware of this and and what if she
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
might have additional information is
 
01:31:28.109 --> 01:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
that correct representative frishman yes
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
um the one of one of the practitioners
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
that is being sued is Jason Rafferty who
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
wrote those guidelines for the AAP and
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
um soon after those were published um
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
James caner wrote uh a huge takeown of
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
it um pointing out how the the supposed
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
data was
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
fraudulent um there was no you know
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
there was no scientific evidence what
 
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
they were saying and now he he was one
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
of the doctors treating Isabella and so
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
he's getting sued the ap's getting sued
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
and I I don't see how the gender medical
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
complex can can go forward with this the
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
way they're treating kids fraudulently
 
01:32:22.159 --> 01:32:24.310 align:start position:0%

01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chair um I may have
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
this wrong but I believe in the
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
beginning of your testimony you talked
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
about having met a lot of people who
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
have are detransitioning and I'm
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
wondering in what context either
 
01:32:44.189 --> 01:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
professionally or are these how have you
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
met these people um well Khloe Cole well
 
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
first of all um Katie Anderson lives
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
well she doesn't live in New Hampshire
 
01:32:53.790 --> 01:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
but she works and goes to church here in
 
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and she's been doing a lot
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
of speaking around the state we we saw
 
01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
her last night in
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
gtown and then Khloe Cole was here um in
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
April and um pra
 
01:33:13.709 --> 01:33:13.719 align:start position:0%
Mosley um visited shortly after that um
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
and I've and of course I've been reading
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
testimony so then it would be accurate
 
01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
to say that these are people who have
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
been speaking publicly and you've heard
 
01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
and followed rather than um perhaps
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
working as a social worker who has a lot
 
01:33:36.109 --> 01:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
of people coming to see you who've had
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
or being a parent and having a lot of
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
your kids friends who are having this
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
problem that that you when you say
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
you've met a lot of people these are
 
01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
um who are speaking out and um
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
nationally well um I've also spend I
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
also do a lot of reading of the drr
 
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
subreddit where people go on there
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
privately they don't want to reveal
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
their identity and they're ter terribly
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
afraid to reveal their identities and
 
01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
they talk about the horrible regret and
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of them H you know a lot of these
 
01:34:18.189 --> 01:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
procedures happening when they're
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman um I'm
 
01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
specifically wondering um can you speak
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
to the long-term data on the perianal
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
pull through vaginal
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
plasties I thank you for the question
 
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative I am flattered that you
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
thought I could answer that question but
 
01:37:40.589 --> 01:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
I I know a number of Physicians who have
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony that our
 
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
members who provide this care in New
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then I'm sure I'm happy to
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
take that question back to them and get
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
a clear answer for you I would hate to
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
and accurately represent that can I add
 
01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
two questions to that them to get to us
 
01:37:58.750 --> 01:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
um are are these you may want to give
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
her a chance to BU down the first one
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
yeah um could you repeat the first one
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
so specifically um what's the long-term
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
data look like on the perianal pull
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
through vaginal plasties those are the
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
ones that are required to take um col
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
colonic tissue essentially um be in
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
cases where say there are a couple of
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
um but puberty blockers would be one
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
there's not enough penile tissue um to
 
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
use okay and then the other is
 
01:38:34.109 --> 01:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
um is uh is that safe and effective
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
data and then just uh the last one would
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
be how many of these surgeries are
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
performed on children in New Hampshire
 
01:38:46.239 --> 01:38:47.589 align:start position:0%
performed on children in New Hampshire
each

01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
each
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
year any genital gender reassignment
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
surgeries not specifically the paranal
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
pull through but we should have that
 
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
delineated as well as phow
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
plasties okay thank you you're welcome
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from committee
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
members representative Missour yes thank
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
you um yeah so the statement in here
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
says similar to what representative
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
kushman just said but just to clarify so
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
our state's Physicians who provide
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care care does that
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
include gender reassignment surgery
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so I know um you
 
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
all should have re received written
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
testimony uh via the virtual signin from
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
Dr Francis Lim Liberty who works with
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and I believe um Courtney
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
Tanner who represents Dartmouth spoke on
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
the testimony that you folks were
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
received and I believe that question is
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
covered in her testimony unfortunately
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
there were no providers represented here
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
today so we were not able to get that
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
information they will be sending it
 
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
along but we still haven't heard that
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
today okay I'm happy to bring that bring
 
01:39:54.910 --> 01:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
that question back to the surface thank
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome representative Weber
 
01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
but just to be clear my understanding is
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
that you're saying that that testimony
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
has already been uploaded to our general
 
01:40:08.589 --> 01:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
court website correct thank
 
01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:11.080 align:start position:0%

01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
repeat the uh position that did the
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
upload on that testimony um so I believe
 
01:40:19.589 --> 01:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
it's going to be the I think it was a
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
letter with multiple signes but Dr
 
01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:24.920 align:start position:0%

that we had heard earlier that there
 
01:40:43.709 --> 01:40:43.719 align:start position:0%

in New Hampshire and I did check with um
 
01:40:48.669 --> 01:40:48.679 align:start position:0%

01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't perform any under 18 18 bottom
 
01:40:55.229 --> 01:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
surgeries and actually they don't do any
 
01:40:58.510 --> 01:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
transgender surgeries under the age of
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%

community and Specialty hospitals the
 
01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
hospital Association is opposed to House
 
01:41:55.950 --> 01:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 619 as introduced as well as the
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
non-gain amendment number um 2023 2359 H
 
01:42:06.189 --> 01:42:06.199 align:start position:0%
which would amend RSA 332 to prohibit
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
gender surgery on Miners and prohibit
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy on miners the New

policies which Advance Health Equity and
 
01:42:17.709 --> 01:42:17.719 align:start position:0%
inclusion for all individuals House Bill
 
01:42:20.589 --> 01:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
619s non gerain amendment is contrary to
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
the principles of Health Equity and
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
inclusion and would be discriminatory
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
towards an often marginalized group in
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
our society in addition the non-gain
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
amendment is an overreach by effectively
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
attempting to legislate the practice of
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
medicine this is a precedent that should
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
be avoided furthermore prohibiting all
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
public and private insurers from being
 
01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
required to provide coverage for gender
 
01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
affirming Health Care further
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
discriminates against this often
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
marginalized segment of our society we
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
also believe this am Amendment would
 
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
conflict as um Miss Reed from the ACLU
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
identified um it conflicts with current
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
health insurance non-discriminatory
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
statutes as well as other
 
01:43:03.589 --> 01:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory state statutes we
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you to find this non-gain
 
01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
amendment and the underlying bill as an
 
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and thank you for
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to provide these
 
01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:13.719 align:start position:0%

01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
Miss in a hand foring the question in
 
01:43:25.229 --> 01:43:25.239 align:start position:0%
regards to the insurance earlier I asked
 
01:43:28.109 --> 01:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
about the issue of Rissa in whether the
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
state law has any impact on the benefits
 
01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
that one can provide under the Risa
 
01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
plans I know you're not an insurance per
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
se but you sort of alluded to it as far
 
01:43:38.669 --> 01:43:38.679 align:start position:0%
as in your testimony would there be
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
somebody in the hospital Association or
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere we could get that kind of
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
information back to us um thank you
 
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:46.760 align:start position:0%

01:43:49.149 --> 01:43:49.159 align:start position:0%
I um don't represent insurers I did work
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
for one for a number of years um orisa
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
as you indicated is um does not fall
 
01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
under State Statute so that would there
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's no ability those statutes um
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
that are cited in the amendment um would
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
not cover Arisa plans just like they
 
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
won't cover Medicare or they won't cover
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
um um Medicare Advantage
 
01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:13.239 align:start position:0%

minutes there we go before I get to my

prepared testimony I just want to um
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
take issue with the level of
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
condescension um earlier um that parents
 
01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
will be unable to grasp the nuances of
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
this type of care and by implication
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
that licensed medical providers would
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
also require input from this body um as
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
the only I'm going to have to you have
 
01:45:22.109 --> 01:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
three minutes to so excuse me you have
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
three minutes for your testimony thanks

for thanks for making me pause um
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
because this body is the only one
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
capable of grasping this topic I'm a PhD
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
chemist and I'm also an attorney facts
 
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
matter to me and polics have no place
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
politics have no place in the provision
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
of medical
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
care as a legislator in the in New
 
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:43.960 align:start position:0%

your duties incumbent on you as a state
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative impartiality requires at
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
at least a modum of research on the
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
relevant subject prior to proposing any
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
law to a Bridges citizen's right over
 
01:45:59.709 --> 01:45:59.719 align:start position:0%
1.3 million doctors recognize the
 
01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
medical necessity of transition related
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
care for improving the physical and
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
mental health of transgender people
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
especially young people as a parent of a
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
transgender son it's bills like this
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
that encourage the daily systematic
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
attacks on his safety and on his mere
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
existence your actions have very real
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
consequences and you Purp are inflicting
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
harm on children of New Hampshire the
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
group that you claim to care so much
 
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
about HB 619 is born out of willful
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
ignorance of the facts and is a blatant
 
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
attempt yes point of order sorry we

New Hampshire I'm a mother of six and
 
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
also a physical therapist the last three
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
years of my full-time job has been being
 
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
a mom to my four youngest at first
 
01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
staying home was due to the pandemic now
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
it's for a different reason my
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
16-year-old child has been struggling
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
with many physical and mental health
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
issues over the past three years this
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
past year they transitioned to
 
01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
homeschooling due to their severe
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
migraines unfortunately we didn't
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
realize at the time just how severe our
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
child's Depression was or that they were
 
01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
also experiencing gender dysphoria in
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
March for the first time in my presence
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
they expressed they were experiencing
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
near constant Suicidal Thoughts while at
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
a physician visit immediately I sought
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
counseling for them after beginning
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
therapy they were slowly able to talk
 
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
more openly to us about things in
 
01:48:39.070 --> 01:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
September they came to me and asked if
 
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
they were too old to start hormone
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
therapy after that conversation a Hu
 
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
huge weight lifted from our child's mind
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
we now have seen an endocrinologist and
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
are beginning the process of starting
 
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
hormone replac replacement therapy to
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
allow our child to have a more feminine
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
body they get at home in my queer child
 
01:48:57.550 --> 01:48:57.560 align:start position:0%
has started their own journey and I'm
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
here to support them however I can
 
01:49:01.709 --> 01:49:01.719 align:start position:0%
witnessing the self-isolation and severe
 
01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
depression my child has endured has been
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
horrific and painful as their mother a
 
01:49:07.589 --> 01:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
heartache I hope few parents have to
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
cope with we are incredibly fortunate to
 
01:49:11.950 --> 01:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
continue to have our child here with us
 
01:49:13.709 --> 01:49:13.719 align:start position:0%
today in their attempted after their
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide recently I sat in a
 
01:49:17.950 --> 01:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
doctor's office while at their side as
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
they reveal details of that attempt
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
there attempt was before they came to me
 
01:49:23.709 --> 01:49:23.719 align:start position:0%
about HRT before they were able to
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
express how lost they were feeling in
 
01:49:27.310 --> 01:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
their own body now there is finally
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
light creeping through the darkness they
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
have been living in as their mom I am
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
able to feel hope again for their future
 
01:49:35.149 --> 01:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
I am grateful every day that their
 
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
beautiful face is still here for me to
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
touch I know for certain that they would
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
not be if it wasn't for the gender
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
affirming care that they will soon
 
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
receive if you were to ask my teenager
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
today if they hope to have gender
 
01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
affirming surgery they will say I don't
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
know if they come to me next year and
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
they say they need surgery I will
 
01:49:53.310 --> 01:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
support them until they are able to find
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
the care they require for their survival
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
it is not the place of the legislature
 
01:49:58.990 --> 01:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
to determine when a referral is
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
medically necessary for essential health
 
01:50:02.350 --> 01:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
care and block insurance coverage for
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
that care gender affirming care is
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
always medically necessary and is life-
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
saving at every age as a mother and a
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
medical professional I know how to
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
advocate for my children I ask questions
 
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
I listen and I trust I trust in both the
 
01:50:18.189 --> 01:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
practitioners providing care for my
 
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
family and I trust in my children's word
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
if my child is unable to live in a body
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
that is not the one that they were
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
biologically given at 16 years old I
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
cannot comprehend how that suddenly
 
01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
becomes a legal right at 18 most
 
01:50:33.149 --> 01:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
importantly I cannot fathom how it is
 
01:50:34.589 --> 01:50:34.599 align:start position:0%
expected that their mental health would
 
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
support them to live through such
 
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
struggle to reach 18 many transgender
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
kids die by Suicide due to gender
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
dysphoria they experience and the
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
extreme mental anguish they struggle
 
01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
through every day as a mother I support
 
01:50:48.669 --> 01:50:48.679 align:start position:0%
the Essential Medical Care that can be
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
life-saving for teens like mine
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%

01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
let me be very clear there is absolutely
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong or unnatural about being
 
01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
transgender as a transgender man myself
 
01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:09.560 align:start position:0%
I grappled with the feelings of
 
01:52:12.069 --> 01:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
internalized transphobia and shame for
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
most of my life now that I have been
 
01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
able to access gender affirming care I
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
have been able to live a much happier
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
healthier life there are a lot of
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
misconcep ctions and misinformation
 
01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
surrounding gender affirming care
 
01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to care for
 
01:52:27.390 --> 01:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
minors minors rarely receive any surgery
 
01:52:29.790 --> 01:52:29.800 align:start position:0%
and those receiving surgery are 16 or 17
 
01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
not young children let me frame it this
 
01:52:34.589 --> 01:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
way the age of consent in the state of
 
01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is 16 years of age a
 
01:52:38.589 --> 01:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
16-year-old can legally get pregnant and
 
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
bear a child why do we trust the
 
01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:42.679 align:start position:0%
cisgender heterosexual teenager to go
 
01:52:44.669 --> 01:52:44.679 align:start position:0%
through pregnancy a permanent medical
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
decision and raise a child but not the
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
transgender teenager who feels so
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
dysphoric and uncomfortable in their own
 
01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
skin that they need to undergo the
 
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
process to receive gender affirming care
 
01:52:56.589 --> 01:52:56.599 align:start position:0%
now let me also be very clear that no
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
teenager in New Hampshire is able to
 
01:52:59.830 --> 01:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
readily get gender affirming genital
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
surgeries there is therapy reference
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
letters and long wait times involved
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
despite all of this trans people still
 
01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:08.679 align:start position:0%
go through the process to receive care
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
why because gender affirming care is
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
life-saving and necessary I survived
 
01:53:15.790 --> 01:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
four suicide attempts before I turned 18
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
years old this committee has been told
 
01:53:19.950 --> 01:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
time and time again the statistics on Su
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
side and trans youth HB 619 is
 
01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and flies in the face of all
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
the major medical organizations that
 
01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
have already stated that gender
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
affirming care is medically necessary
 
01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
the American College of Physicians among
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
other leading medical organizations has
 
01:53:36.189 --> 01:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
condemned efforts to criminalize gender
 
01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
affirming care and other evidence-based
 
01:53:39.870 --> 01:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
care as interference with the physician
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
patient relationship receiving gender
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
affirming care is the only
 
01:53:46.109 --> 01:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
evidence-based approach to address
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria and transgender
 
01:53:50.109 --> 01:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
teenagers parental rights are of also
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
often mentioned in the discourse around
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care I have a quote
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
from a parent who I know is supportive
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
of their trans child bans on gender
 
01:53:59.790 --> 01:53:59.800 align:start position:0%
affirming care infringe on my right to
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
take care of my child in the way that
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me and is supported by
 
01:54:05.950 --> 01:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence why are my rights as
 
01:54:07.709 --> 01:54:07.719 align:start position:0%
a supportive parent given less weight
 
01:54:09.149 --> 01:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
than those who wish to not support their
 
01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
trans kid decisions on General affirming
 
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
care should be left to the patient their
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
doctor and their parents I do not know
 
01:54:17.229 --> 01:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
every single transgender minor in the
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so I cannot speak
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
on whether the fact
 
01:54:21.790 --> 01:54:21.800 align:start position:0%
they should or should not receive gender
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
affirming care this committee does not
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
know every single terance gender minor
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire so
 
01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
important medical decisions like
 
01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
receiving gender affirming care should
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
be left to those who understand the
 
01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
individual situation the most the
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
patient doctor and their parents I ask
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
this committee to vote in expedient to
 
01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
legislate all forms on House Bill 619
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um you're speaking
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
for someone else are you prepared to
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
take any questions are you just
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
ttim it depends on the question I can't
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
speak for him but sure are there any
 
01:54:58.350 --> 01:54:58.360 align:start position:0%

01:55:04.350 --> 01:55:04.360 align:start position:0%

01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
I understand you to say at the beginning
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
of before you read the testimony that
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%

01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:03.069 --> 01:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.669 --> 01:56:05.679 align:start position:0%
minutes my name is Lind Jake house I use

they them pronouns I live in Dover I'm a

01:56:09.149 --> 01:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
non-binary
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
transperson um and I am strongly opposed
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
to the current bill and the amendment um
 
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
and urge committee members to vote itl
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
on either um
 
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
as someone who has been active with um
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
supporting the transgender community in
 
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire since
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
2017 um I just want to state that
 
01:56:32.109 --> 01:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
there's no form of HB 619 that is
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
acceptable gender affirming healthc care
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
is medically necessary health care and
 
01:56:39.709 --> 01:56:39.719 align:start position:0%
all of it from puberty blockers to
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
hormones to surgeries is deemed safe by
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
every major medical
 
01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
organization um I am someone who hopes
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
to be a parent in the next couple of
 
01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
years and if my a child were to be um a
 
01:56:55.149 --> 01:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
trans daughter and she were to tell me
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
that she needed puberty blockers
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
hormones even surgery at um under the
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
age of 18 which would only be likely to
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
happen at 17 I would do absolutely
 
01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
everything in my power to support her um
 
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
including seeking a referral out of
 
01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
state if we were not able to find and
 
01:57:17.069 --> 01:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
Care in New Hampshire um and I would be
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
a extremely upset if um insurance was
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
not able to cover it I think it's
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
unprecedented to try to block insurance
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
from covering these procedures um in
 
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
2018 I attended the hearings um that
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately removed the exclusion on
 
01:57:36.109 --> 01:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid covering gender affirming and
 
01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
Care um and the last step of that
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
committee or Le last step of that
 
01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
process was the joint legislative
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules I was
 
01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
really deeming that um the exclusion
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
needed to be removed to bring new
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire into compliance with the
 
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act um and to not be
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
opened up for any lawsuits so I'm not a
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer but my understanding is that um
 
01:58:02.189 --> 01:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
or stopping um reversing that decision
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid would open up New Hampshire
 
01:58:06.990 --> 01:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
to lawsuits and I have never seen any
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation that would seek to
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
block uh private insurance from covering
 
01:58:16.229 --> 01:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
any kind of care um again this as care
 
01:58:19.629 --> 01:58:19.639 align:start position:0%
only happens in a very small number of
 
01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
transgender girls who have um started
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
the transition process early um I only
 
01:58:29.149 --> 01:58:29.159 align:start position:0%
know of one anecdotal evidence of one
 
01:58:31.709 --> 01:58:31.719 align:start position:0%
trans girl getting in the surgery out of
 
01:58:33.629 --> 01:58:33.639 align:start position:0%
state um not sure if it's the same
 
01:58:36.030 --> 01:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
person that attorney Chris ell referred
 
01:58:39.149 --> 01:58:39.159 align:start position:0%
to or not um but that's the only
 
01:58:41.310 --> 01:58:41.320 align:start position:0%
anecdotal evidence that I know of of one
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
person getting that right before or
 
01:58:48.990 --> 01:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
college um and this these decisions are
 
01:58:51.069 --> 01:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
always always made between a doctor
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
parents and um the minor involved after
 
01:58:59.069 --> 01:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
much discussion um and other steps
 
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
including in hormones prior to that um
 
01:59:05.589 --> 01:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
and it's not up for this body to ban any
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
sort of of medical care you all are not
 
01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
um or medical professionals or experts
 
01:59:16.350 --> 01:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
on on this type of care we should trust
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
doctors to do this as Case by case where
 
01:59:24.069 --> 01:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
it is necessary to relieve a dysphoria
 
01:59:27.310 --> 01:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
um and your time is up sure I'm happy to
 
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:29.360 align:start position:0%

my name is Elanor mcdna I live in exiter
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm opposed to HB 619 and as amended
 
02:00:14.189 --> 02:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a state that values
 
02:00:16.030 --> 02:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
personal freedom for its citizens and
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation is a significant blow
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
to the medical freedoms that we hold
 
02:00:21.790 --> 02:00:21.800 align:start position:0%
dear this discriminatory bill is
 
02:00:23.430 --> 02:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
government overreach at its worst and
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
would set a terrifying precedent that
 
02:00:27.149 --> 02:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
the government knows better than parents
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
on how to raise their kids putting the
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
state in between parents teens and their
 
02:00:34.589 --> 02:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
doctors comparisons on gender affirming
 
02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
care with use of tanning booths and
 
02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
heroin are not appropriate examples as
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
those are not medical procedures that
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
are approved by the major professional
 
02:00:45.310 --> 02:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
medical organizations in our country
 
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
when legislating against personal
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
medical rights any infringement is not
 
02:00:51.390 --> 02:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
only dangerous it's a slippery slope it
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
is not the role of government to decide
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
if care which is widely acknowledged as
 
02:00:57.629 --> 02:00:57.639 align:start position:0%
the best treatment for gender dysphoria
 
02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
is medically
 
02:01:01.470 --> 02:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
necessary as a transwoman I know from my
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
own personal experience that gender
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
affirming care is essential lifesaving
 
02:01:08.109 --> 02:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
Healthcare among trans Youth desistance
 
02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
and d-transition rates are incredibly
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
low the most recent study this year in
 
02:01:14.669 --> 02:01:14.679 align:start position:0%
the prestigious Journal Pediatrics
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
showed that 97.5% of trans youth
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
continue to identify as Trans on a
 
02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
5-year followup the sample size was also
 
02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
larger than all previous sample sizes of
 
02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
this population 317 trans youth trans
 
02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
kids are insistent persistent and
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
consistent about who they are and the
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
Nationwide trend of legislating against
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
their existence is not only disturbing
 
02:01:38.189 --> 02:01:38.199 align:start position:0%
it is having a negative impact on their
 
02:01:40.069 --> 02:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
mental health it's time for these
 
02:01:41.709 --> 02:01:41.719 align:start position:0%
performative attacks on them and state
 
02:01:44.589 --> 02:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
legislatur to stop it's also time to
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
stop using the time of this important
 
02:01:48.990 --> 02:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
body on unnecessary regulations and in
 
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
instead focus on the real issues that
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters care about like access
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
to housing education quality jobs and
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
our environment New Hampshire should
 
02:01:58.589 --> 02:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
continue to be a place where all
 
02:02:00.510 --> 02:02:00.520 align:start position:0%

Blum I'm from Portsmouth New Hampshire I
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
am also non-binary and I use the them
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
pronouns um here to highlight a couple
 
02:02:47.790 --> 02:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
of things I won't repeat what's been
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
said because I I think the points been
 
02:02:53.589 --> 02:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
made um I did not write testimony today
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
I've come from lived experience and one
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
thing that stood out to me in the
 
02:03:00.270 --> 02:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
beginning was the last five words of the
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
Pledge of Allegiance that we all looked
 
02:03:05.709 --> 02:03:05.719 align:start position:0%
at that flag over there and recited them
 
02:03:06.910 --> 02:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
if you do not remember what they are
 
02:03:10.069 --> 02:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's liberty and justice for all this
 
02:03:13.229 --> 02:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation and Amendment Mar
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:17.870 align:start position:0%
uh is
a

02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
exclusive practice it is not inclusive
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
to all people it is excluding an already
 
02:03:27.790 --> 02:03:27.800 align:start position:0%
marginalized Community I am a part of I
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
am visible and present for the invisible
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
our community in of itself is protective
 
02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's secretive and that's because people
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
are afraid to either share their story
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
publicly or they're afraid to live
 
02:03:44.109 --> 02:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
authentically because
 
02:03:46.990 --> 02:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
of something the home might not be safe
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
families or there's other reasons that I
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
I can keep going on about what I won't
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
um what I will
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
say is the medical professionals have
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
already testified I come from uh a place
 
02:04:08.109 --> 02:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
where data dries decisions I'm not an
 
02:04:08.119 --> 02:04:09.629 align:start position:0%
where data dries decisions I'm not an
expert

02:04:09.629 --> 02:04:09.639 align:start position:0%
expert
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
in uh being a doctor and I am an well
 
02:04:15.790 --> 02:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
not an expert I am I do have lived
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
experiences being a transgendered
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
non-binary individual so I can speak to
 
02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
that um however I se I feel that none of
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
you have sat in a doctor's office as a
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
physician or someone who's providing
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
care to someone who actually needs
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care so I find it
 
02:04:39.709 --> 02:04:39.719 align:start position:0%
difficult to hear about how personal
 
02:04:43.069 --> 02:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
opinions will get in the way of medical
 
02:04:47.549 --> 02:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
decisions um I see that this proposed
 
02:04:50.270 --> 02:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
legislation will will harm and continue
 
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
to harm our community uh when the
 
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
similar legislation came up earlier this
 
02:04:59.549 --> 02:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
year the day that it was shut down uh a
 
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
teen actually did commit suicide within
 
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
our community jumped off the bridge 293
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
um so this is real we are here we are
 
02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
seen uh there was talk earlier about 405
 
02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
surgeries were performed Over The Last 5
 
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
Years easy math let's call it 100 a year
 
02:05:20.189 --> 02:05:20.199 align:start position:0%
none of them were new New Hampshire so
 
02:05:21.310 --> 02:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
we're here to talk about New Hampshire
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
the other thing we're going to talk
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
about is the D transitioners I've lived
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
in this community for a long time
 
02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
secretively and now publicly I've never
 
02:05:32.669 --> 02:05:32.679 align:start position:0%
met one from New Hampshire so if they
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
would like
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
to send me a message I'd love to chat
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%

morning um I am speaking um telling
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
going to tell you a story about a
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
32-year-old woman who in 1969 had
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
experienced five miscarriages and went
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
to her doctor and said I would like to
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
have a child um this woman was my
 
02:06:59.069 --> 02:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law and she was given a drug
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
called Dees which is a synthetic
 
02:07:04.189 --> 02:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
artificial synthetic
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
non-steroidal estrogen and endrin
 
02:07:13.390 --> 02:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
disruptor this drug was uh sold to
 
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
patients and doctors to prevent
 
02:07:19.109 --> 02:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
spontaneous abortions despite the lack
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
of proven efficacy they had no proof
 
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
this would
 
02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
work her doctor said let's give this one
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
shot um she took uh the drug and uh she
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
did have a successful pregnancy but we
 
02:07:38.430 --> 02:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
now know from history that that those
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
shots and that drug did nothing to make
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
that pregnancy happen what it did do is
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
create um
 
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
multi-generational problems for any
 
02:07:56.910 --> 02:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
person born after having their mother
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
take that drug we have Dees children who
 
02:08:04.669 --> 02:08:04.679 align:start position:0%
are born with uh
 
02:08:04.679 --> 02:08:06.549 align:start position:0%
are born with uh
abnormalities

02:08:06.549 --> 02:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
abnormalities
 
02:08:09.870 --> 02:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
cancer they have a higher risk of cancer
 
02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
than anyone else and we are now seeing
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
grandchildren are having uh effects from
 
02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:20.189 align:start position:0%
grandchildren are having uh effects from
this

02:08:20.189 --> 02:08:20.199 align:start position:0%

02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
drug my mother-in-law uh thankfully in
 
02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
some aspects um does not know that the
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
drug she took will be affecting her two
 
02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
grandchildren she passed away at the age
 
02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:33.030 align:start position:0%
grandchildren she passed away at the age
of

02:08:33.030 --> 02:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
59 she was diagnosed at 53 with a very
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
rare type of uterine
 
02:08:45.549 --> 02:08:45.559 align:start position:0%
cancer um and at that point there was
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
nobody made the connection that it was
 
02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
from this drug that she took to have a
 
02:08:54.669 --> 02:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
pregnancy state I'm talking about this
 
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
drug um because it did finally get
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
banned in 1970 one year after she took
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
it it took until 1980 for it to get
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
banned in
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
Europe um and it still even after that
 
02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
was still being given not to humans but
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
to animals and so it ended up into the
 
02:09:16.589 --> 02:09:16.599 align:start position:0%
food supply finally in the year
 
02:09:19.149 --> 02:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
2000 the year that her first grandchild
 
02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
was born it was finally designated as a
 
02:09:25.629 --> 02:09:25.639 align:start position:0%
carcinogen as far as her grandchildren
 
02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
right now we do know uh from studies
 
02:09:31.549 --> 02:09:31.559 align:start position:0%
that there are neurodevelopmental issues
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
which both my children suffer
 
02:09:36.669 --> 02:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
from I will not ever share with my
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
children that they are suffering this
 
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
because of a choice their grandmother
 
02:09:44.669 --> 02:09:44.679 align:start position:0%
made an uninformed de your time is up if
 
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
you could wrap up
 
02:09:50.750 --> 02:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
please um I just want to say that every
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
service industry and that's what the
 
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
medical society is a service industry
 
02:09:57.149 --> 02:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
needs to be regulated and they don't
 
02:09:59.470 --> 02:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
know all the answers and but we do have
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
proof from Europe that the drugs and the
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
surgeries don't work and I suggest that
 
02:10:09.149 --> 02:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
we pass this Bill thank you thank you
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
02:10:13.709 --> 02:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
representative kushman thank you Mr
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for um sharing
 
02:10:18.750 --> 02:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
that story with us um
 
02:10:21.030 --> 02:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
when you say that they don't work are
 
02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
you seeing the same studies that are
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
showing that um that mental health and
 
02:10:31.870 --> 02:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
suicide ideation is higher after
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
transition care or gender affirming care
 
02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
starts hormones puberty blockers or is
 
02:10:38.669 --> 02:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
it something
 
02:10:42.149 --> 02:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
else I'm saying that giving the hormones
 
02:10:44.549 --> 02:10:44.559 align:start position:0%
and the and the blockers too they are
 
02:10:46.549 --> 02:10:46.559 align:start position:0%
causing more physical
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
damage um they have studies uh done
 
02:10:52.830 --> 02:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
where the uh
 
02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
bones um are breaking um of young
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
children that were given blockers or any
 
02:11:02.830 --> 02:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
hormone um we're in my opinion we're
 
02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
playing with Mother Nature and when we
 
02:11:06.669 --> 02:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
start introducing
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
artificial uh things into the body there
 
02:11:12.669 --> 02:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
are consequences and maybe unintended
 
02:11:15.069 --> 02:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
consequences but there are consequences
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
to changing what nature and God has
 
02:11:23.310 --> 02:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
already provided for us other
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
questions say no other questions thank
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:43.149 --> 02:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:45.149 --> 02:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
Smith good
 
02:11:47.310 --> 02:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you for taking my
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
testimony um I am a transgender woman
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
and I am also a retired medical
 
02:11:57.310 --> 02:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
physician um I also while I can't
 
02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
represent P flag New Hampshire I've been
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
very active with P flag New Hampshire
 
02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
and know multiple not also through
 
02:12:08.589 --> 02:12:08.599 align:start position:0%
personal connections multiple parents of
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
transgender girls and I think that's the
 
02:12:15.310 --> 02:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
Germain thing in this first section I'm
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
not going to speak to the second section
 
02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
I think the um Mental Health Providers
 
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
have spoken quite well to it but the
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
fact that there is currently
 
02:12:29.470 --> 02:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
no provider in New Hampshire
 
02:12:32.790 --> 02:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
providing um the gender affirming
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
surgery Galo surgery because I point out
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
that this amendment I've already spoken
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
against the underlying Bill last
 
02:12:44.109 --> 02:12:44.119 align:start position:0%
spring um that
 
02:12:48.589 --> 02:12:48.599 align:start position:0%
the testimony about uh breast reduction
 
02:12:52.350 --> 02:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
surgery um or removal is non- gerine to
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
this non- gerine amendment because this
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
is about Gult surgery and I want to just
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
Echo what has already been said about
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
the emotional impact if you
 
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
interfere because you've selected 18
 
02:13:11.589 --> 02:13:11.599 align:start position:0%
solely because that's after 18 the legal
 
02:13:15.069 --> 02:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
age at which this person can now make
 
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
their own decisions and the fact is I
 
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
know multiple parents whose children
 
02:13:25.709 --> 02:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
have in this more modern era been able
 
02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
to talk to their parents early on about
 
02:13:30.990 --> 02:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
their gender
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
dysphoria and get the appropriate care
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
and I have yet to hear as was indicated
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
before of any one of those people
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
regretting with parental support and
 
02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
other support transitioning
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
and if you say to a 16 or 17year
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
old great you're going to graduate and
 
02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to get to go out and do
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
this that and the other and they have no
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
chance of feeling
 
02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable in their own body as an
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
adult because they didn't get a chance
 
02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
to have that surgery and you're
 
02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
threatening to criminalize even
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
referring them across state lines for
 
02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
this then you really are having a huge
 
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
impact on that family and I would beg
 
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
you not to go down that path I mean I
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
also would say as a medical provider you
 
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
have no
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
business doing this kind of thing about
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
something you really don't
 
02:14:41.069 --> 02:14:41.079 align:start position:0%
understand and you're not criminalizing
 
02:14:41.079 --> 02:14:42.629 align:start position:0%
understand and you're not criminalizing
other

02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
surgeries being provided because oh my
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
gosh we haven't had adequate follow-up
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
studies well that has happened on on
 
02:14:52.149 --> 02:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
quite a few things and I think as
 
02:14:53.950 --> 02:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
medical providers we've gotten a lot
 
02:14:56.669 --> 02:14:56.679 align:start position:0%
better since the dees story and by the
 
02:14:59.589 --> 02:14:59.599 align:start position:0%
way that Dees story from then those
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
providers were going against their
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
own Medical Professional societies that
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
had already said well before that don't
 
02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:10.069 align:start position:0%
had already said well before that don't
give

02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
give
 
02:15:13.790 --> 02:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
Dees your time is up if you could so and
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know I'm happy to answer any
 
02:15:22.149 --> 02:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:25.950 --> 02:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you um thank you for taking
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
my question and welcome back thank you
 
02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm interested in this exploration
 
02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
from a medical provider's
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
perspective of having to weigh the
 
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
risks of a bad outcome and and virtually
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
every medical procedure that I've ever
 
02:15:48.109 --> 02:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
undergone I have been told that there
 
02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
were risks of a bad outcome and I chose
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
whether to have the procedure or not
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:59.350 align:start position:0%
based on
that

02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
um am I
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
not could you speak generally to the
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
risks on the one side of a bad outcome
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
of a procedure or a treatment as applied
 
02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
to uh minors with gender dysphoria
 
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
versus the risk of leaving them without
 
02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:22.109 align:start position:0%
versus the risk of leaving them without
the

02:16:22.109 --> 02:16:22.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
treatment that is needed yeah I think
 
02:16:27.950 --> 02:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
that's unfortunately so
 
02:16:30.990 --> 02:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
individual that it requires good Studies
 
02:16:33.589 --> 02:16:33.599 align:start position:0%
by non-biased individuals and I think a
 
02:16:36.150 --> 02:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
lot of things that have been cited about
 
02:16:39.870 --> 02:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
worse outcomes after gender treatment
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
are really kind of trying to find people
 
02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
who are unhappy still and there's lots
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
of reasons to still be unhappy it can be
 
02:16:54.270 --> 02:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
very hard to make this work believe me I
 
02:16:56.790 --> 02:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
didn't try to make it publicly work
 
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:00.160 align:start position:0%

decades um it's just this is tough stuff
 
02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
and by the way cross- seex hormones are
 
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
not toxic that's a
 
02:17:16.589 --> 02:17:16.599 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization they are not
 
02:17:16.599 --> 02:17:20.230 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization they are not
toxic

02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:20.240 align:start position:0%

amendment um every person has the right
 
02:17:57.870 --> 02:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
to make medical decisions for themselves
 
02:17:59.790 --> 02:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
and their children with the guidance of
 
02:18:02.589 --> 02:18:02.599 align:start position:0%
their chosen Medical Professional no
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
person or group should have that right
 
02:18:08.349 --> 02:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
threatened or revoked as Representatives
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
it is imperative that you trust the
 
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
people you represent to make decisions
 
02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
about their own bodies and for their own
 
02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
families as was stated there are always
 
02:18:23.709 --> 02:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
risks and there are always rewards to
 
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
proposed medical treatment and it is up
 
02:18:28.429 --> 02:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
to the patients and their medical
 
02:18:31.309 --> 02:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
professionals to decide the path that is
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
best for each individual as was also
 
02:18:38.589 --> 02:18:38.599 align:start position:0%
stated these situations are very nuanced
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
and there are so many variables that
 
02:18:44.669 --> 02:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
that come uh with these situations for
 
02:18:47.469 --> 02:18:47.479 align:start position:0%
each individual patient that you simp
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
simply as a governing body do not have
 
02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
the time to sit in a room with each
 
02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
individual case and make that caseby
 
02:18:56.910 --> 02:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
casee decision with them that is best
 
02:19:00.750 --> 02:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
left to their medical professionals and
 
02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:02.309 align:start position:0%
left to their medical professionals and
themselves

02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:19:06.030 --> 02:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
um so each person is best equipped to
 
02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
know what is healthy and necessary for
 
02:19:09.549 --> 02:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
them and their family they're best
 
02:19:11.629 --> 02:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
equipped when given the information to
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
make decisions based on their own health
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
and what they know is the best path
 
02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
forward for that
 
02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
I believe that this proposed amendment
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
and legislation is taking away the
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
rights of people to make their own
 
02:19:27.669 --> 02:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
