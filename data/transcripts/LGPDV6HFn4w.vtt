management and here to introduce the
 
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
bill is representative ger good morning

card and I also like to remind committee
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
members that uh for for our purpose in
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
these hearings is to receive
 
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 align:start position:0%
testimony if we have questions on what
 
00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
the person has said that's fine but we
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
want to um make sure we are not arguing
 
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
back and forth we are not uh with with
 
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
the person testifying that we are not
 
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
um uh asking leading questions we are
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
just here to listen to what people have
 
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
to say regarding the legislation before
 
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
US Representative Bixby would you like
 
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
to add anything to that um yeah I I
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
think that one of the things that we can
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
do in order to make our our process a
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
little bit more efficient is uh pay
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
attention to if you if you hear uh a
 
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
witness provide an answer to a question
 
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
and it's clear that that is what they
 
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
are you know what they think is in fact
 
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
the case uh don't ask the same question
 
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
again in a different way because you're
 
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
not going to get a different
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
answer um so uh think about um what's
 
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
your think about what's going to get the
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
most information out the most
 
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
efficiently don't try to
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
um and if the answer if the if a
 
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
question really has been answered don't
 
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
um just don't reiterate it
 
00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you I also want to inform uh
 
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
committee members that I have to
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill in election law at 20
 
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
after 10 so uh I will leave the
 
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
committee in the capable hands of our
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
vice chair representative ktoa and with
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
that I would like to begin our hearing
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
and good morning representative gerana
 
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you madam chair
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues uh I don't have
 
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
written testimony but I did pass around
 
00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
a document uh should be enough copies
 
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
for everybody and two for the clerk that
 
00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 align:start position:0%
I'll be referring to during my uh
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
introduction so the the origin of this
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
bill regarding uh plans for leech eight
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
management and transportation I think
 
00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
we're all aware of reporting uh over the
 
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
last year about problems with management
 
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
of lee8 and uh
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation at some of the landfills
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire uh last July there
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
was an article in New Hampshire bulletin
 
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.430 align:start position:0%
was an article in New Hampshire bulletin
about

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
um infractions I quote hundreds of uh
 
00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
infractions hundreds of times that uh
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
cassella at their their Bethlehem
 
00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
facility failed to keep leachate to its
 
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
required levels and to file mandatory
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
reports that uh article from the
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
bulletin in July also referred to at
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
least three other facilities in the
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
state that received letters citing
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
deficiencies associated with lee8
 
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
management uh and so this bill is a very
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill as you can see from the
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
sponsorship uh uh we have worked with
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
I've also spoken with uh Mr POI from uh
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
the turnkey facility in Rochester to try
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
to better understand uh how they deal
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
with leech eight at that
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
facility uh I'll be speaking in a moment
 
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
to some specific changes that uh I think
 
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
I will be coming forward with an
 
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
amendment based on conversations with uh
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
the experts at Dees and the and the
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
folks at at TurnKey but uh I I think
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's clear that we recognize that this
 
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
is a problem in the state as you said
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
that that article last summer made it
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
clear that uh there are a number of
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
facilities and some facilities with
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
literally citing hundreds of potential
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
violations we need to address this
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
concern particularly as we become more
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
and more aware of the dangers of pasas
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
these uh this leachate this uh so-called
 
00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
uh trash juice is filled with these
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
materials they are disposed of
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately through our wastewater
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
treatment uh plants and uh so the danger
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
to Public Health both in terms of
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
potential onsite problems potential
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation issues but also as we
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
consider how they are ultimately
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
disposed of this is an issue that a
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
bipartisan group of our legislature has
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
come together to
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
address with the increased frequency and
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
severity of rainstorms that we've seen
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
you know once in a century floods every
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
three to five years over the past few
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
years we are seeing uh larger and larger
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
quantities of leech eight being produced
 
00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:42.039 align:start position:0%
at these facilities and that is part of
 
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
the reason why we're in the problem uh
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we are in is because the plans for
 
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
leech a management did not when they
 
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
were uh these facilities were brought
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
into operation they were not designed
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
for the amount and severity of the
 
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
rainstorms that we've been getting so
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
they're not adequately prepared in many
 
00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:00.519 align:start position:0%
cases is to be able to deal with the
 
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
amount of leech a that's being produced
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
at these facilities so um again that is
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
one of the driving motives behind this
 
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.240 align:start position:0%
legislation is the recognition uh that
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
with the increased severe weather we've
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
had that we need to be much more mindful
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
about how we are managing leate on site
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
at transporting it and ultimately seeing
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
it uh disposed of I want to speak very
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
briefly to one of the objections that
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
were already seen about uh potential
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
concerns that this would somehow uh be a
 
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
problem for businesses that this would
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
hamper the ability ability of businesses
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
to innovate obviously what we know about
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
p is changing methods for treating P are
 
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
changing rapidly businesses certainly
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
need to be able to come up with new
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
methods for treating the leech a turnkey
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
does some really interesting uh a couple
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
of different ways that they
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
pre-treat their lee8 before it is
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
transported actually through pipes
 
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
rather than trucks to a facility a
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
Wastewater facility so we need that
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
Innovation this bill does not in any way
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
hamper Innovation this simply says when
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
you're applying for a a permit I'm going
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
to talk about the language a little bit
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
in a minute when you're applying for a
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
permit you have to have a plan a
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
detailed plan for how you're going to
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
manage the leech a on site how you are
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
going to transport that leech a offsite
 
00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:28.839 align:start position:0%
and a a recognition that you have some
 
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
responsib ility for making sure that it
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
is disposed of in a safe way on the
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
other side it doesn't
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
dictate how that has to be done it says
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
nothing at all about specific methods of
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
doing these things which would uh you
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
know instantiate in statute requirements
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
that could hamper Business Development
 
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
none of that uh and there is a passage
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
in the second paragraph of this bill
 
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
which says very clearly uh when you
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
change you have new contracts for
 
00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
example uh for transportation or uh or
 
00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
disposal the leech 8 you simply have to
 
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
then report those new contracts uh it
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't as you said in any way restrict
 
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
the content of those contracts it simply
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
says that when you enter into new
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
agreements those new agreements have to
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
be reported as part of the plan that is
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
provided to the
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
department so what I've distributed to
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
you all is
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
a um it's not a formal uh draft of an
 
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
amendment it's some new language that I
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you all and
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
depending on uh how our conversation
 
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
goes uh you know sending this to OS to
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
have as an amendment for when we do a
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
work session or an executive session but
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh some of these changes that you see in
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
the handout that I provided are the
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
result of the conversations I've had
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
with uh Mike whimet uh and uh with Mr
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
POI from uh waste management at TurnKey
 
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
so if you look at uh the bill itself the
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
the page that has State of New Hampshire
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
at at the top unfortunately I apologize
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the uh photocopy that you all
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
received that kind of highlighted
 
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
portions are very very difficult to see
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
they got kind of uh washed out in the
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
the photo copy if you look very very
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
hard you can faintly see outlines but
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
I'll point to them uh in this text and
 
00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
if you look at the other side of the
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh you will see the specific
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
references that are were highlighted uh
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
on on the first side the bill as you can
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
see has two paragraphs the first
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph is about a leech eight
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
management plan to say that when you're
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
applying for uh a permit and again I'm
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
going to speak about that language you
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
have to have a plan that plan contains
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
certain elements About Management
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
transportation and Disposal for the
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
lifetime of the facility including post
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
closure period the second paragraph
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
contains some specific language around
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
contracts that operators would have with
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
companies again for disposal or uh or
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation or or
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
disposal when I met with director whims
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh and spoke to the folks at at TurnKey
 
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
about their operation uh it became clear
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
in the bill as it is written there's
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
some language in that second
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph specifically about long-term
 
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.629 align:start position:0%
paragraph specifically about long-term
contracts

00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
uh that is inappropriate for that
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
section of the bill we can't under you
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
know completely understandably we can't
 
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
require these facilities to be able to
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they have contracts 20
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
or 30 years down the road obvious that
 
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
that's not how it works uh and I
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate that feedback so what we did
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
is we removed some of that language from
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
the contractual paragraph the second
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
paragraph and we put that up the plan is
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
to move it up to the first paragraph
 
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
right so that it is not required in
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
terms of demonstrating a a contract that
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
contains these things uh but instead to
 
00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:05.959 align:start position:0%
say that your plan when you submit for a
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
permit must contain details about how
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
you plan to deal with these things
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
um so if you if you see my summary of
 
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.590 align:start position:0%
um so if you if you see my summary of
proposed

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:18.519 align:start position:0%
changes I'll walk you through very
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
briefly just five changes all of the
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
language from the bill you have in front
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
of you is there it's been moved around
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
and it's been adjusted in a couple of
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
cases so after discussion with
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
Dees uh I think it makes sense to change
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
the phrase permit for construction to
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
operating approval that is as I
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
understand it a more accurate reflection
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
of the permitting
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
process number two at the suggestion of
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
Dees an amendment that uh I would plan
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
would include expansions of landfills
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
they said that that was as far as they
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
were concerned entirely consistent with
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
what they do and anyway how they would
 
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
evaluate applications for expansions of
 
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
landfills third this has to do with that
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
language that was moved out of the
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
contract section up into the section
 
00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:13.759 align:start position:0%
requiring a
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
plan the uh the language throughout the
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
entire life of the facility including
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
the post closure period has been moved
 
00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
as I said from the contractual
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
requirement section up to the details of
 
00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
the lee8 management plan
 
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
likewise number four the language
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
regarding frequency of shipments and
 
00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
details of contingency plans has also
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
been moved into the section on the leech
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
8 management plan obviously again these
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
are things that uh by their nature
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
contingencies things change business
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
relationships change uh we can't require
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
all of those things over a long period
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
of time in contract but we need to make
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
sure number one that they are in the
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
plan from the beginning and number two
 
00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:02.759 align:start position:0%
that when changes are made in those
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
contracts that they are subsequently
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
submitted to
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
Dees uh and finally there is a section
 
00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
at the bottom uh the new subp paragraph
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh this I think is likely to be removed
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
because uh upon discussion with uh
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
director whimet um I think some of the
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
other changes above actually removed the
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
necessity for adding uh this paragraph
 
00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
in particular especially that change uh
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
regarding op operating approval uh that
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
phrase so uh that is an overview of the
 
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
bill I hope I have explained it in a way
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
that makes sense uh and and also in a
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
way that allows uh you to see how the
 
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
changes keep the purpose and the
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
language of the original bill but uh
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
after consultation uh have probably
 
00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:54.759 align:start position:0%
something that we would want to do thank
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%

this bill uh to bring it to us in a u
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%

had a question yeah I have it's just a
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
clarifying question since uh since the
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
highlighting didn't come through I just
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that when you what
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is what's being
 
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
23 yes that's correct representative
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
Miner thank you madam chairman and thank
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
you uh representative one question I
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
have is so you're saying that Waste
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
Management has in place this uh this
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
leeching uh um um information available
 
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
to us but gella doesn't is that correct
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
in saying that am I correct in saying
 
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.510 align:start position:0%
in saying that am I correct in saying
that

00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
no I thank you for the question I don't
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
believe uh that's the case by rule right
 
00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
now a number of these things are already
 
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
required uh and are overseen and that's
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
you know for example that article
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
referred to actions that kind of Dees
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
has taken with regard to a number of
 
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
operators in the State uh so uh I
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
believe that uh Dees has this
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
information uh on you know from all of
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee representative King thank you
 
00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
for testifying on this bill um what
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
recourse is there if if any that if the
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
plan that is provided in order to get
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
the permit later falls through you know
 
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't follow through on
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
their plan or something happens where
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
oops we didn't quite pull it off like we
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
thought we would that's kind of my
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
concern is yeah you you had a but you
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
didn't execute and now the water table's
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
been poisoned what do you say about that
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
thank you that's an excellent question
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I would defer on
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
some of the details to to Dees I don't
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
know if they're they're here if we have
 
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
some folks great uh on some of those
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
details uh excellent thank you uh but my
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
understanding is that first of all we
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
have to think about the relationship
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
between these operators and Dees is an
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
ongoing conversation so when it comes to
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
monitoring the plans and whether or not
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
the plans are being being implemented I
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
think that's part of an ongoing
 
00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
relationship between Dees and operators
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh Dees also has the ability again that
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
and I can provide this specific citation
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
to the committee that article from July
 
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
refers to letters and and actually has
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
links to certain letters that Dees wrote
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
to some of the operators in the state
 
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
about deficiencies in their uh their
 
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
management of of leech a so that's part
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
of an ongoing process and then when
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
there are violations as there there have
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
been as I said Dees can speak to the
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
specific uh mechanisms that they use to
 
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement representative Howard thank
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um in this letter that
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
we just got from the Bia um and thanks
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative J for putting together
 
00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.039 align:start position:0%
such a great idea um they they mentioned
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
that regulation um might uh what do they
 
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
say instituting a statutory approach
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
there is serious risk of stat statutory
 
00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559 align:start position:0%
parameters turning into restraints on
 
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
Innovation and I'm just wondering if uh
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
if the plans are
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
are you know just can't be expanded
 
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
after thank you very much for that
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
question Representatives so so two
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
things number one as I as I mentioned
 
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
before there is nothing in this bill
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
that is going to stifle uh Innovation
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
right again when new contracts are
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
entered into
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
as new technologies develop uh though
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
that information can just be forwarded
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
to Dees right so there's nothing that
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
locks them into any particular method or
 
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
any particular contract so I don't see
 
00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:12.039 align:start position:0%
where the argument comes from that
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
Innovation is uh is being stifled uh as
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
to the first part of that question uh I
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
will only say that I worked closely with
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
Dees to craft the language especially in
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that I plan to put
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
forward and Dees has told myself and
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
representative eel who attended that
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
meeting that they see this as a valuable
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
tool that goes hand inand with what
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
currently exists in rules so uh we have
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
worked hard to make sure that this isn't
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
simply a dup duplication of what's in
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
rules but that it is in fact an effort
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
to put something in statute that helps
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
Dees Implement rules in a more effective
 
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.870 align:start position:0%
Dees Implement rules in a more effective
way

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um is there is there
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
any any way to write into the language
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
um increasing the plan or changing the
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
plan I think I will punt on that to to
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
Dees because I think it is connected to
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative King's question about how
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
Dees uh relates to these operators and
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
and what the consequences would be if a
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
company fails to adhere to its plan so I
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
think Dees can speak to that better than
 
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.190 align:start position:0%
think Dees can speak to that better than
I

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
can anybody else have questions
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
seeing n thank you representative Jama
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
Grace thank you madam chair n Grace for
 
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
the business and industry Association uh
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you all taking the time to
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
look at the letter that I handed out
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
earlier today um so let me just start
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
off by saying we do uh oppose this bill
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
as it has been introduced to you based
 
00:22:58.039 --> 00:22:58.990 align:start position:0%
as it has been introduced to you based
on

00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
the representatives prior testimony it
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's going to be a
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
substantial rewrite so I'd certainly uh
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
like to have the opportunity to take a
 
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
look at that and see how that would
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
affect um our position um but one thing
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
that I would like to point out which is
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
not in the letter but which I thought of
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
uh as the testimony proceeded this
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
morning was simply asking the question
 
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
of whether this legislation was
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
necessary um I think there was a
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
reference to a article in the New
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire bulletin um which cites uh New
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees issuing a number of
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
letters of deficiency and taking a look
 
00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:39.559 align:start position:0%
at those letters they cite specific
 
00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:45.559 align:start position:0%
Provisions within the EnV uh 86 rules uh
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
and basically said hey operator you're
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
doing things wrong so there already
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
rules in place that regulate these areas
 
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
and the point of the letters is
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
obviously to induce The Operators to
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
make Chang changes to uh manage leate in
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
a different manner
 
00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
so um based on the description of the
 
00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:11.559 align:start position:0%
forthcoming Amendment um and the ability
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
of operators to Simply alter the
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
contracts you know imagine a scenario
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
where I'm an
 
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
operator or I I would like to be an
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
operator um so I submit a plan to Dees
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
and then I can just go and change a
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
contract a month later so what's the
 
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
point of that um is kind of my question
 
00:24:38.389 --> 00:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
um it seems that to me that a better
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
option is to allow the administrative
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
rules to continue what they normally
 
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
continue which is give Dees authority to
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
regulate uh this particular area um
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
refine kind of what the federal federal
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh pering rules are as well
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
and as part of that process
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
um assist operators uh if and when um
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
issues arise um that's certainly part of
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
de's technical assistance um it's
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
something they can do in a Nimble
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
fashion within the rule framework which
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
is much harder to do in the statute if
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
you were to put this in statute because
 
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
in statute they'd have to come back to
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature make changes rather than
 
00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
um take a look at their existing rules
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
or write their rules in a manner that
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
allows them to look at things like new
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
Innovative products for treatment of
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
pasas um you know as as we learn more
 
00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
about that as operators experiment with
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know what could we do to pre-treat
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
leate before it goes to the wastewater
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
treatment facility um you know is
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
something like a resin solution going to
 
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
work is something like a carbon based
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
solution going to work is it going to be
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
the case that Ro filters are the best
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
option as they really narrow that down
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
um Dees has that Authority within their
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
their current regulatory framework and
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
certainly they could rewrite uh the rule
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
the rules if necessary um to allow them
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
to do that as other states have done uh
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
to help address uh new and emerging um
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
issues that arise out of leech Aid
 
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
management um as well as of course
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
provide technical assistance for Best
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
Practices um so I just don't I think you
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
know although I haven't seen the
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
language for the substantial rewrite of
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
the amendment I believe it's the case
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
that our position would be to continue
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
to oppose it based on the fact that it's
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
simply not necessary
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:33.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bixby yes thank
 
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
question so uh the way I'm reading the
 
00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
bill it is essentially requiring that
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
when a landfill is being planned it is
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
that uh that part of that planning has
 
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
to uh requires Advanced planning for how
 
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
lee8 is going to be managed and that's
 
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
going to be something that that gets
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
built in the INF infrastructure of the
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
landfill but it also looks like uh the
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
the way that it's phrased here it allows
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
for updating as requirements um you you
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned contracts um so uh this is
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
this is a plan for like 30 years so
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to plan your
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
contracts for 30 years of course so it
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
leaves that it seems like leaves that
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
um that Avenue still open for changing
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
contracts as you need to so I'm not
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
quite sure uh how this is going to be um
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
if you have if you have if it gives a
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
lot of leeway for discussion between the
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
department and the and the operator I'm
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
not could you explain a little bit more
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
how that is going to be uh uh limiting
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
the operator's
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
Freedom well the department and the
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
operator already have the the
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have that discussion and
 
00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
Lee's already a managed I'm going to
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
call it an item but Ma trash juice is
 
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
already managed right so it's not like
 
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
you can start up a landfill and just you
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
know dump it into the river that's not
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
the process there's a whole regulatory
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
framework laid out under the 806 rules
 
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
about how you treat this so as you plan
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
a new landfill you already have to look
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
at the rules and you already have to
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
have in place uh you know a plan uh
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
engineering engineering design um and
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
then in response to what's actually
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
happy on the landfill you have to make
 
00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
adjustments as that goes which is going
 
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
to require discussion with Dees under
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
their existing rules so again I I'm not
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
sure what this legislation adds
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
to the regulatory framework other than
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
to you know freeze it in place and
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
obviously as we've heard from earlier
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
testimony there are some concerns about
 
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced and the language
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh as introduced um causing an
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
interpretation to be that you have to
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
have something like you know a 50-year
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
contract which simply I think everybody
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes is not doable followup yes so
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not quite sure where the uh
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
where this changes the relationship with
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
the rules other than just clarifying how
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
so to build off your question
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not sure how this
 
00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:45.799 align:start position:0%
changes the rules other than it
 
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
constrains uh the the current rul making
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
process in in a manner which again I
 
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the amendment I don't know
 
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
if that's something that the uh
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
committee would be amendable to
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
um that constrains the ability of Dees
 
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
to adopt rules that reflect uh what
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
they're actually seeing thank you
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative Howard then
 
00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.430 align:start position:0%
representative Howard then
representative

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair um so the
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
way I see it is that this this bill
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
would establish a starting point or a
 
00:30:24.029 --> 00:30:24.039 align:start position:0%
commitment to uh to a plan and um and if
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
if we wait to make rules that respond to
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
conditions that have already say gone
 
00:30:32.509 --> 00:30:32.519 align:start position:0%
bad then the horse is out of the barn so
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
it seems like this this amend this um
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
bill will help us to establish a
 
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
commitment to dealing with leech a in
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
the best possible
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
way so my response to that would be as I
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
understood it the reason for this
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
legislation was because of an article in
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire bulletin citing Dees
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
letters of
 
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
deficiency based on existing rules
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
so again there already rules in place
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
Penza so I have two questions if I thank
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um thank you for your
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
testimony so would you would you think
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
that a thousand violations in a row be
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
evidence uh in these letters that
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
Behavior I can't speak
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
to uh you know the process of
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement at the departmental level I
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
what I would say is
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
that you know uh attempting but not
 
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:53.799 align:start position:0%
capturing the existing rules to rewrite
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
them in a different place is not
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to change uh how those
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
you know what what people do with
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
those followup thank you madam chair so
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the current Rule
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
now um environment
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
80653 that requires no less than two
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
locations for Le trate treatment or
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
disposure shall be available by written
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
agreement to manage the quantity of
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
leate generated by the facility during
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
its active life and then it you've got
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
further I've got a question
 
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
um because basically your your testimony
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
is contradicting this bill doesn't set
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
newa it just sets the guard rails for
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
that are you familiar with these are
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
already in place like the leate stuff
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
that you already have to do is already
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
in place it's not changing that it's
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
just putting some parameters thank you
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative uh Penza that's um
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
exactly the point that I'm trying to
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
make is there's no reason uh this bill
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
is entirely unnecessary if it the entire
 
00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
purpose of it is to Simply move the
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
rules into State Statute Dees already
 
00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:08.919 align:start position:0%
has the rules in place they've adopted
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
rules uh as far as I'm aware they work
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
well um and they certainly uh Garner
 
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.190 align:start position:0%
well um and they certainly uh Garner
public

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
attention representative Willer thank
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for taking my
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
question would you say that Dees rules
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
are more or less
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
what's the word I want to use protected
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
more or less uh long-term than a state
 
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
statute is but I mean wouldn't you say a
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
state statute is more affirmative of
 
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
what the state is actually trying to do
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
around those rules and if there's a
 
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
presented problem such as a thousand
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
instances of such a thing happening a
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
state statute would be more impactful
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
if I understood the correctly if I
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
understood the question correctly
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler uh you're asking
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
me whether I think that uh a state
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
statute uh is longer lasting than uh the
 
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.510 align:start position:0%
statute uh is longer lasting than uh the
agency

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
rules um my understanding is that
 
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
generally the legislature grants
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
agencies the authority to write rules
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
because they recognize the technical
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
experts that the agency uh are in the
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
best position to assess uh really the
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
technical aspect specs as well as new
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
Innovations coming forward and adjust
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
those those rules if proper over time um
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
so rather than having to come back to
 
00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature uh and go through a
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
legislative process uh the rul making
 
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
process can occur at the agency level
 
00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:44.839 align:start position:0%
among those technical experts with
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um they are having
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
input followup
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
yes I appreciate that now wouldn't it be
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
true that in some instances say for
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
instance uh I don't know trash juice is
 
00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
leeching out and poisoning the land of
 
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
the state that it's maybe prudent for
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature to take a step forward
 
00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
and put those rules into statute or you
 
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
know there are instances where Dees and
 
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
the technical expertise of the
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
organization should create those rules
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
and then there are other instances where
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
the public health is so profoundly
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
affected that the legislature and the
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
representative should do something where
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
do you think that line is well given
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
that the 806 rules exist and they've
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
gone through the jail car process
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
therefore uh seen approval by the
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
legislature they've been in place for a
 
00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
long period of time um what I would say
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
is that it seems like it's the
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislature's policy that Dees should
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
regulate leech 8 um and the agency
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
that okay representative H Haskins thank
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
you madam chair good morning Nate
 
00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
morning would you agree that the state
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
has a leech a
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
problem I don't know that I would be
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
qualified to judge that representative
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay um if I may second question y so is
 
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
it your understanding that the
 
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%
legislature makes the rules makes the
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
rules representative that the way I
 
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
would frame it is the legislature sets
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
the general policy regulate lee8 the
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
agency goes out through the rul making
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
process has created the 806 rules that's
 
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
what we have in place right now um and
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
it's my belief that those those work
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
well thank you okay representative
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
Howard hi so again um so the again the
 
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
way that I see it the the laws and the
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
rules are conceptual they they the
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
concept of controlling leech a is is
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
defined in the rules and in the law and
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
the plan is a is a detailed and
 
00:37:11.069 --> 00:37:11.079 align:start position:0%
specific approach but at that site by
 
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
that that by that um P
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
purveyor that would that would answer
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
the rules the the concept that would
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
fill the concept in that at that place
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
by that person or that by that
 
00:37:26.589 --> 00:37:26.599 align:start position:0%
company so so there's it's there's a set
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's is is do you see a difference
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
between the rules and the actual plan as
 
00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
you know as a fulfillment of the
 
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
concept I'm not sure I entirely
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
understood the question representative
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
Howard but I would do my best to respond
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
um you know because the 806 rules exist
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants to open a new landfill
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
in the state would have to keep account
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
of those rules along with any additional
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
rules applicable to them uh along with
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
obviously any state statutes permitting
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
Etc at the state Federal level
 
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
um in their entire engineering for that
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
facility um so it would already be the
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
case that
 
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
they're that they're taking account of
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
this so again there's no need to add
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
additional statute to this because it
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually add anything to
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
what potential new operators are doing
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
um at best it's repetitive at worst it
 
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
interferes with or would create a
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
conflict with existing rules or
 
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
potential future rules based on uh you
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
know new technologies coming online or
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
based on you know new requirements uh
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know maybe the impossibility of
 
00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
certain contractional language Etc um
 
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
and so the only thing that ends up doing
 
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
is is gumming up the works as uh
 
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
businesses try to figure out you know
 
00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
what are the rules that I'm supposed to
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
follow because I
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
I have a state statute plus I have these
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
rules um and we're also come we're also
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
hearing from you know other other
 
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
industry players you know here's some
 
00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
new Innovative technology like example
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh pfast treatment it's working really
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
well in some other state we want to
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
bring it in you know it may be the case
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm not an expert at New Hampshire's
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
rules but it may be the case that you
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
know like in Vermont uh our our agency
 
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
could say yep we're going to go through
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
our permitting process make some slight
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
adjustments so we can have that as a
 
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
potential use here um whereas if we're
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
in State Statute we're stuck and we have
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
to come back to the
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislature uh you know get permission
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
from the legislature which then would
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
require the agency to rewrite the rules
 
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
and you're you're taking this long
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
process instead of uh really shortening
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
it up which allows you know treatment of
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
something like past to occur in a faster
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
manner representative Miner thank you
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
madam chairman one quick question do you
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
see this this to be a burden on um on
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
the industry as opposed to um what it
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
actually does in my opinion is um give
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
us more in-depth look at what's going on
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
in the um in the uh
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
leeet thank you for the question uh yes
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
we would consider this a burden on the
 
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
industry um because again you'd be
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
setting up this whole another regulatory
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
framework even though one already exists
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
followup thank thank
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
you this in my again in my opinion this
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
seems to clarify what's already written
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
do you agree with that statement I do
 
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
not thank you okay any other questions
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
for your testimony this morning I'd like
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
to call Tom

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
ABC welcome Mr Tower you've asked for
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone um there's been so
 
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
much discussion around the article in
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire bulletin I thought I'd
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
take the opportunity to pass it around I
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
think it's informative and and probably
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
a good idea that if you can to to uh
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at it
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
um first of all Madam chair nice to see
 
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
you presiding over this committee again
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
and all the familiar faces that uh we've
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
spoken to over the years it's nice to
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
see you for those people that I have not
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
met and for the record my name is Tom
 
00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
Tower and I uh live in Whitefield New
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here also uh
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
representing North Country Alliance for
 
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.990 align:start position:0%

balance

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
change um I'd like to than that uh that
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
every bill that comes before you know
 
00:41:47.359 --> 00:41:48.150 align:start position:0%
every bill that comes before you know
this

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh is important um and I've
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
seen an awful lot of them over the years
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
um but not all of them are urgent
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
this one is
 
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
urgent and I'm going to take uh just a
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
minute to read a few of the passages
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
that are in that New Hampshire bulletin
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
piece which I think will further
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
exemplify why we feel this is urgent so
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative ger spoke about uh a
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
situation that occurred in Bethlehem and
 
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
in that particular facility Lee is
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
pumped off the liner where it travels
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
through pipes and onto a storage tank
 
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
before getting trucked off the facility
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
and treated from the second half of 2021
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
to the first half of 2023 the landfill
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
pumped out 2.8 million gallons of lee8
 
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
per quarter that's skyrocketed from the
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
second half of 2023 to the beginning of
 
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
2024 to 5.2 million gallons per
 
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
quarter by rule landfills are also
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
required to have systems in place to
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
prevent more than 12 Ines of lee8 from
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
being stored on the liner on hundreds of
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
occasions between July 2023 and June
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
2024 the Bethlehem facility failed to
 
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:12.559 align:start position:0%
keep to that required level and in one
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
16.42% be any higher than 12 in because
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
when it does go higher than 12 in it
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
puts an undue amount of stress on that
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and could potentially
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
lead to a
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
disastrous uh issue of contamination and
 
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
contamination HB
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
566 addresses a regulatory Gap requiring
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
detailed planning for the backend
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
including transportation and wastewater
 
00:43:59.470 --> 00:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
treatment the plans do not include that
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
today today it's primarily collection
 
00:44:06.549 --> 00:44:06.559 align:start position:0%
and storage does this put an undue
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
burden I shouldn't say undue but does it
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
Place additional burdens on an applicant
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
well yes it does yes it does but at the
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
same time the benefits of health and uh
 
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
the the benefits to local economy
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
surrounding these areas that are
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
potentially contaminated are
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
incomparable and I I am happy to take
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you Mr Tower any
 
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the representative Bixby
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
yes so um thank you madam chair and uh
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr tower for coming in uh so
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
do uh am I correct in in understanding
 
00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
your testimony as saying that the
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
advantage of uh this bill over existing
 
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
rules as is that this bill actually
 
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
covers the entire life cycle of the
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
leate process as opposed to just the
 
00:44:59.710 --> 00:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
front end of it that is correct in life
 
00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
cycle it certainly can't be on in F item
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
but there's already been amendments to
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh clarify the fact that you couldn't
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
put mechanisms in place or contracts say
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
Beyond a 20year horizon I haven't seen
 
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment but yes that is correct
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby thank you any other
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Tower appreciate
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
you coming today thank you committee um
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Wayne Morrison also from North
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
Country ABC you've asked for five
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
minutes but if something's already been
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
said that you've heard please uh refrain
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.319 --> 00:45:51.390 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:54.559 align:start position:0%
welcome Mike there you
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
go you may want me to turn it off
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
I came this far I might as well deliver
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
um before I I I I I probably won't need
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
five minutes but I have some written
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
testimony but I wanted to put my view of
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
this bill in context before I
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
started I think this committee certainly
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
myself uh six years ago when I think of
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
a landfill I think of trash haulers I
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
think of a mountain of trash I think of
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
odors scavenger Birds you know noise
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's the part of the land landfill
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
that I
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
understood um and I had no view I had no
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
insight into the invisible part of the
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
dangers of a landfill which is uh
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
lee8 and although we are deeply
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about you know protecting the
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
environment and our our
 
00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:47.559 align:start position:0%
water um I have come to learn that leech
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
eight is a much greater risk to our
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
health and our safety than that mountain
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
of trash that we can all see very
 
00:46:57.309 --> 00:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
visibly I don't know if you know it or
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
not uh but landfills generate an
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
incredible volume a staggering amount of
 
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.470 align:start position:0%
incredible volume a staggering amount of
this

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
leachate it's my understanding that in
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
the the six landfills that we have in
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire produce
 
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
something north of 100 million gallons
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
of Lee shade every
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
year that's an unbelievable amount that
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
has to be dealt with and lee8 um as you
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
may know is a
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
cocktail of heavy metals toxins
 
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
P um and the process that we have today
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
the best available system we have today
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
is all of that leech a in one form or
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
another is either trucked or piped to a
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
municipal solid waste facility and if
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
everything works
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
perfectly um some of those toxins are
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
removed and some of them aren't and P
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
for example either ends up being
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
concentrated into sludge or bricks that
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
go back to the landfill or a certain
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
percentage of it the solution we have
 
00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
today is to dilute it into our rivers in
 
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
many cases the meramac river so
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
forgetting about spills and leaks and
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
problems if the system's working
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
perfectly we have a flawed system to
 
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.790 align:start position:0%
perfectly we have a flawed system to
begin

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
begin
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
with to me the reason to even point that
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
out the volume of this stuff is
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
is I think the legislature needs to
 
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
stand up and and make a policy position
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
on this stuff I am guessing that your
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
constituents near those wastewater
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
treatment plants have no idea what's
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
being released into the
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
river I think we need to be prudent
 
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
diligent I don't know if this creates a
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
little bit more work for the
 
00:48:53.069 --> 00:48:53.079 align:start position:0%
operators but the risk to human health
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
and to the environment is
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
great and leech a is is becoming a
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
greater and greater problem what you
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
heard earlier
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
was the climate has changed we are
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
having more severe
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
storms it is going to be probably more
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
and more difficult to predict how much
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
leech a is going to be generated each
 
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
year and we don't have a lot of excess
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
capacity at our Municipal Solid Waste
 
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
facilities I think this is a policy
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
decision There are rules to today I
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
would say they're not effective enough
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
we can't be careful enough with how we
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
handle this stuff so I would ask the
 
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
committee to think hard about um this is
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
this is risks and benefits to the people
 
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
of the state and the downside of a
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
problem with leech eight is a is a huge
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
problem and we can't be careful enough
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
so I think from my my testimony is ncbc
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
strong L supports this bill the more we
 
00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:00.799 align:start position:0%
learn about leech 8 the more concerned
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
we should be and today we don't may
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
maybe technology will save us maybe we
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
will figure out a way to remove some of
 
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:08.799 align:start position:0%
those toxins but today they're not
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
totally removed and I would ask the
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee to think hard about how can we
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
put every Bell and whistle in place to
 
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
protect not only the environment but the
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
health and safety of citizens who today
 
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
I'll bet most are unaware of the risk
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
that that they're under so
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
we strongly would suggest you support
 
00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.789 align:start position:0%
we strongly would suggest you support
this

00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:30.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you so much um Mr Morrison
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a question from
 
00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.630 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a question from
representative

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
you so much for coming in with your
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
testimony um just for the record I think
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's important could you explain um
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
because I know you know um the process
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
of when Lee's like leaving let's say uh
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
NCS in Bethlehem and goes to wastewater
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
treatment plant um that process how it's
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
a circular motion and then ends up
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
coming back into the
 
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
landfill yeah so um and again I I I I I
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh I've been on a crash course and
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
learning about this stuff because you
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
know it it's complicated but uh you know
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
leech a in various forms has to be first
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
collected in the liner then yet
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
generally stored you know pumped and
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
stored on tanks and then pumped out of
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
those tanks into into trucks trucked 100
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
miles down to either conquer or
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester or Franklin or one of the
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
waste treatment facilities in the
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
area it goes through a process uh some
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
of the materials are um collected in
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
solids and and brought back to the
 
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
landfill and the the effluent is then
 
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
released um after the processing into
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
the river so we have a very convoluted
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
system right I mean if you think about
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the state um half of
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
our waste comes from out of state so you
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
think about the the footprint right
 
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
we're driving hundreds of miles up in
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
the case of ncees to with trash we're
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
extracting the leech eight and then
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
going a 100 miles south to the waste
 
00:52:09.319 --> 00:52:10.190 align:start position:0%
going a 100 miles south to the waste
treatment

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
plants I think what the article that my
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
colleague uh Tom Tower brought forward
 
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
is a you know there were problems and
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
part of the reason there were problems
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
was there was capacity issues at the
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
municipal Solid Waste
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
facilities I guess that's not cella's
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
fault it you know they they had to they
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
didn't have a they didn't have a
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
solution it is their fault to let
 
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of lee8 build up in
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
the liner system um because that's a big
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's a structural infrastructure
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
problem the the ler could fail but
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever happened there's
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
there's a limited amount of capacity and
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
it it to me it just
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
reinforces how we need to be extremely
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
diligent we need to reduce we need to
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
move our our efforts towards diversion
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
and and and and stop bringing so much
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know we got to reduce the amount of
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
trash and and trash you should think of
 
00:53:04.829 --> 00:53:04.839 align:start position:0%
trash as leech a they are one and the
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
same you can't have one without the
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
other and leech eight is extremely
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous and we can't be too
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
careful thank you any other questions
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
so much for coming today I'd like to
 
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
call John Swan from safe Forest Lake
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
uh to come and speak you've asked for
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
morning good morning Madam chair members
 
00:53:33.549 --> 00:53:33.559 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for taking my
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is John Swan I'm the
 
00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
founder of save Force Lake I live in
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
Dalton New Hampshire um I will try and
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
be as brief as possible um I do need to
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
preface my testimony by stating that in
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
order to not get sued at third time by
 
00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:49.799 align:start position:0%
cassella Waste Systems I need you to
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
understand that all of my testimony is
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
my opinion based on my research my
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
experience um
 
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
I want to say first off I I I did email
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
um well documented testimony to each of
 
00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:05.559 align:start position:0%
you I hope you received it I hope you
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
had a chance to read it I also want to
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
point out that uh by my Tally online it
 
00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
265 uh citizens from New Hampshire
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
weighed in took time out of their day to
 
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
weigh in and supported this so people
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
realize that obviously in New Hampshire
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
we have an issue with protecting clean
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
water as well as posos uh land Phi leech
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
8 as well as biosolids and land
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
application as we're seeing what's
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
happening in Maine but I digress um I
 
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
did want to um state that I am not
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
really a fan of the uh amended version
 
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
that I heard at the beginning by uh
 
00:54:45.309 --> 00:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
representative gerana because partly I'm
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
concerned that the the fingerprint of
 
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:49.799 align:start position:0%
Dees which is part of the problem and
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
Industry is on this amendment and uh I
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
I'm not a fan of it furthermore I'd like
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
to say I do support the bill as
 
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
introduced however otpa because I'd like
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
to see it amended to remove existing
 
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
facilities in part because the and once
 
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
once GSL has stopped in Dalton and it
 
00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:09.799 align:start position:0%
will because we we've been at this for
 
00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:11.559 align:start position:0%
six years we're not going to stop
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
Governor aot has come out against it but
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
once that stopped cassella will probably
 
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
go back to NCS and Bethlehem to seek an
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
expansion and I would hate to see they
 
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
be exe Exempted from this requirement
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
since they are kind of the the impetus
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
for this bill and I had nothing to do
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
with this bill uh over the course of the
 
00:55:32.349 --> 00:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
past year I have sent the committee a
 
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
lot of documentation relative to the
 
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
April 22nd or so April leech eight
 
00:55:41.069 --> 00:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
emergency at the Bethlehem facility um
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
in which they had an issue with finding
 
00:55:47.789 --> 00:55:47.799 align:start position:0%
sources for their lee8 their landfill
 
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
leech eight in fact just to clarify um
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
part of it's not the wastewater
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
treatment plant's ability to have
 
00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
capacity to accept the leech it's the
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
toxicity conquer decided to
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
limit in early
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
2024 the intake of NCS landfill lee8
 
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:09.640 align:start position:0%
because of the T tox the toxicity of it
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
um since then uh Manchester was taking
 
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
some however I was told they are not
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
taking it because of the posos in the
 
00:56:20.029 --> 00:56:20.039 align:start position:0%
lead shap so just a point of
 
00:56:22.829 --> 00:56:22.839 align:start position:0%
clarification some of the NCS lee8 is
 
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
being shipped as far away as Madison
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
Maine and to um New Jersey so I do want
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
to get back to my testimony though
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
because I did in my in my documents I
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
sent you I sent you a September 24th
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
2024 letter from the Department a
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
request for more information to cassella
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
and CS landfill and in that um the
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
department the first point they asked
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
for written agreements of no less than
 
00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
two locations for leech a treatment or
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
disposal to manage the quantity of leech
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
a generated by the facility during its
 
00:56:59.470 --> 00:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
active of Life consistent with EnV SW
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
80605 B3 and pursuant to EnV SW
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
110511 so I did uh furthermore in my
 
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
testimony I broke down both of those
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
80605 B requires two locations for the
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
active life it's already in the
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
rules second 110510 B states that um a
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
facility shall obtain and maintain
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
access to at least two authorized
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
locations where adequate capacity exists
 
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
to handle the basically residual waste
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
during its operating and post closure
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
period so it's already in the rules it's
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
already in the rules however if the
 
00:57:40.029 --> 00:57:40.039 align:start position:0%
department comes up and does testify
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
taking a non-pos on this bill and then
 
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
stating why they're opposed to the bill
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps you can ask the department why
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
enforcing these rules because I have
 
00:57:53.029 --> 00:57:53.039 align:start position:0%
sent and it's in your packet a 91a right
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
to no request to the department asking
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
for a copy of those two written
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
agreements that they asked for in that
 
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
September 24th letter of the NCS
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
facility and the response I got from the
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
department and it's in your packet they
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
have no record of that so right now
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
there's two rules covering leee there's
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
no record there's no written agreement
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
that's what was part of the problem in
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
April they were shifting around trying
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
to find people who would take their lee8
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
as it was raining and and they were
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
working on stage six Phase 2 etc etc
 
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
further more I then asked because we're
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
talking about a new landfill that's
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
going to generate it's going to be
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
bigger than NCS the permitted capacity
 
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
life is the the annual permitted
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
capacity in the permit for GSL is 2.5
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
times what NCS is currently permitted to
 
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
accept 600,000 cubic yards a year versus
 
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
2302 200,000 cubic yards a year that's
 
00:58:58.990 --> 00:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
2.5 times what does that buy GSL with
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
all that land it buys room for further
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
permitted capacity life beyond 18 years
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
because if that is not exhausted they
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
can continue to operate by my Tally and
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
I put it in the Forest Lake Landfill
 
00:59:15.069 --> 00:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
information sheet that I sent you that's
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
about 46 years of permanent life for GSL
 
00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:21.559 align:start position:0%
second I asked for written agreements
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
for lee8 Generation lee8 disposal for
 
00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.549 align:start position:0%
for lee8 Generation lee8 disposal for
GSL

00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
GSL
 
00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
there are none I got the same response
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
from Dees they have no written
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
agreements and I did want to let you
 
00:59:36.029 --> 00:59:36.039 align:start position:0%
know that in the current permit
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
applications for the GSL landfill and
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
Dalton they have already changed who the
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants that would
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
accept their leachate in the operating
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
plan uh removing I can't remember
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
conquered um but including New Jersey
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
and Maine so and all of that has to be
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
Tred it's it's not like it it's not like
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
TurnKey which is attached to a
 
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant or avart up
 
01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
in uh you know um Success New Hampshire
 
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
which is tied into a wastewater
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
treatment plant all of NCS land fi leate
 
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
has to be trucked to a plant same thing
 
01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
with GSL it's the same concept as NC and
 
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
I ask you where is that leachate going
 
01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
to go if there's no cure for posos
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's no uh wastewater treatment plant
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
that's going to accept it what happens
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
that's what we're asking and we've
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
tested our wells we've tested the lake
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
we've tested Alderbrook which is what
 
01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:37.039 align:start position:0%
the wetlands flow into that then flow
 
01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
into the amonk river we've tested all
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
that I've done the testing for posos
 
01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:44.839 align:start position:0%
there's no detections we've tested 39
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
homes around the vicinity of the GSL
 
01:00:50.829 --> 01:00:50.839 align:start position:0%
site no detections for peos I've
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
included that in the testimony I've sent
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
you at Great expense in time and
 
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.549 align:start position:0%
you at Great expense in time and
furthermore

01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
GSL itself has tested its own monitoring
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
Wells at the proposed site they have no
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
detections for posos contamination at
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
that facility or at that site it's not a
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
facility yet so hopefully you will do
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
the right thing we need written
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
agreements it's already in the rules to
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire again I'm
 
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
concerned because Dees is not enforcing
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
the current rules that are on the books
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
I feel that an amendment to this bill
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be made made and it needs as
 
01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
needs to be made made and it needs as
representative

01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
wheeler attested to it's going to give
 
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement strength to the rules
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
requiring these facilities to have a
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
contract or an agreement so with that I
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
mean I won't take up any more of your
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
time I would just say that you
 
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
know in 20123 NCS produced 11 million
 
01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
gallons of Lee a that was in 2023 we
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the facility report for
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
2024 that has to be trucked somewhere
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
who's going to take it and why isn't
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
Dees enforcing the rules on the books
 
01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
right now so happy to take any questions
 
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:11.559 align:start position:0%
I believe I can provide any answers you
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
need because I've been studying this for
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
six years okay thank you Mr Swan
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate it you don't see any
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you for coming this
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
morning all righty thank you uh last I
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
have director Michael whimet from New
 
01:02:25.559 --> 01:02:26.910 align:start position:0%
have director Michael whimet from New
Hampshire

good

01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
morning morning Madam chair members of
 
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
the committee um happy to be before you
 
01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
this morning for the record my name is
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
Mike whimet I serve as director of the
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
waste management division for New
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees um G uh Dees is not
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill um as uh
 
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative Jam the sponsor has
 
01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
indicated we've had some discussions at
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
length about the cont content of this
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
bill and worked well together to address
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh some some questions that that we had
 
01:03:04.109 --> 01:03:04.119 align:start position:0%
um I have not actually seen the
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
amendment but I think I understand its
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
content based on the representative's
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
description of it um you know our sense
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
of this bills that the concerns we had
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
with relate in relation to the bill is
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
introduced have largely been addressed
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
um I think uh in response to some of the
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
things that have been said here this
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
morning I think what this adds um by by
 
01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:27.799 align:start position:0%
by amending the statute to have explicit
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
language relative to leech 8 management
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
and the requirement for leech 8
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
management plan is it it just makes it
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
more clear and explicit um the including
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
details of contracts that um that that
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
folks have for management of leech 8 um
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
is something that uh the current rules
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
say you have to have a two at least two
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
outlets for your leech a but they don't
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
specify necessarily the details of the
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
contract so that is a new addition and
 
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh we we don't have any particular
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
concerns about that um and then um I
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
think that it perhaps provides a longer
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
view in terms of making it explicit that
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
the leech a management plan at the
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
outset needs to address um not just the
 
01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
operating period but the post-closure
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
care period And I think what it really
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
does it just puts a current practice
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
into law and in our experience with
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
respect to doing compliance assurance
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
and enforcement having Provisions
 
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
directly in statute is is a powerful
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
thing you have to do it carefully
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
because we we can't have statutes that
 
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
are so lengthy and detailed that they're
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
going to be you know they're going to
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
look like administrative rules but for
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
certain things it's nice to have that
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
clear and explicit Authority in the
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
statute and with that I think I'd just
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions thank
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
for taking
 
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.470 align:start position:0%
for taking
questions

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
um philosophically um just aside from
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
this specific issue if there are
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
rules agency
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
rules um that are there do they have the
 
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
authority to wave those rules or not
 
01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:08.839 align:start position:0%
enforce those rules because there seems
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
to be some questioning of why it is that
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
there' be rules that aren't being
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
enforced and I'm just wondering if they
 
01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:17.559 align:start position:0%
have the authority to wave rules or or
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm not just saying specifically in
 
01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:21.799 align:start position:0%
regards to to leate but just any rules
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
in general can they can can the agency
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
just choose to un enforce rules
 
01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
the well the applicant um can make
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
application for if they feel that
 
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
there's a rule that they cannot comply
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
with but they have a they propose an
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
alternate way of addressing the concern
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
the the statute does allow the
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
department to entertain a request for a
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
waiver of a specific Rule and then in
 
01:05:47.549 --> 01:05:47.559 align:start position:0%
the rules there are specific criteria
 
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
that need to be met in order for the
 
01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
Department to approve that waiver
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
request so we do that sparingly but it
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
does happen uh in some cases okay follow
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
up follow up sure thank you for that um
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
now getting back to the specific Topic
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
at hand it um is it your contention that
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
there have been rules in place regarding
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
lee8 that have not been enforced and and
 
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
if so have there been any applications
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
for such no no we we I don't believe we
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
have any applications for waivers with
 
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
respect to leech 8 management and the
 
01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
department um always Endeavors to
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
enforce all of its rules in including
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
the Lee rules and I I believe that we
 
01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
are doing that thank you representative
 
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
guber thank you for uh coming here and
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
testifying once again um it was stated
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
earlier that this bill uh will constrain
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
the rulle making process and uh you
 
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
understand that in your agency very
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
closely do you think that's the case or
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
with the your discussions with the
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative gerana that this would
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
not be the case again I I have not
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
actually seen this physically seen the
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
amendment but I think I know what it
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
looks like based on the discussions
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
we've had um and and the and the
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
sponsor's description of it here this
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
morning I don't see any particular areas
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
where it constrains the department in a
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
way that would cause concern for us okay
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any other questions
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby um yeah so one of the
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
things that seems to be a little bit
 
01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
unclear still uh just in terms of our
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge is what how the enforcement
 
01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.269 align:start position:0%
knowledge is what how the enforcement
process

01:07:24.269 --> 01:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
works sure sure so um you know our
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
approach not just in the solid waste
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
program but across the es programs is to
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
use you know compliance assurance and
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement in order to ensure we have
 
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
compliance with rules and compliance
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
Assurance starts with education it
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
starts with educating the regulated
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
parties on what the requirements are
 
01:07:45.309 --> 01:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
that they have to comply with and then
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's monitoring which means inspections
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
or or paperwork reviews whatever is more
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate to determine whether the
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
rules are being complied with and in
 
01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
cases where we
 
01:07:56.119 --> 01:07:57.670 align:start position:0%
cases where we
identify

01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
identify
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
um non-compliance we uh do a tiered kind
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
of a tiered structured process where we
 
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
we request compliance could be through
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
an informal letter could be through a
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
letter of deficiency that's issued um
 
01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
and if that's not uh effective then we
 
01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:15.559 align:start position:0%
we have the authority under specifically
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
under our Solid Waste program to issue a
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
unilaterally a unilateral administrative
 
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
order to compel compliance and that is
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
basically an enforceable document that
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
that uh that require that lays out what
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
the violations are and and gives the
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
applicant or gives the uh the regulated
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
party a certain amount of time to come
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
into compliance and demonstrate
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
compliance and then if that doesn't
 
01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
happen again in the case of the solid
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
waste program we have both um uh
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
Authority through the using the New
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Justice to seek
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh injunctive relief through civil or
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
criminal enforcement and also to issue
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
um civil penalties so that's the kind of
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
the gamut of what could
 
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
director for being here and taking my
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
question we've been hearing a lot about
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
lee8 um which we know needs to be
 
01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.229 align:start position:0%
lee8 um which we know needs to be
managed

01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
managed
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
um I just had a question because in 2023
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
we had a catastrophic event in New
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um with flash flooding um in
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
certain areas where landfills were now
 
01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
under a
 
01:09:34.269 --> 01:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
Lee does a
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
Lee 8 management plan plan for those
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
catastrophes or and when or when they do
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
happen what does the how does the
 
01:09:47.789 --> 01:09:47.799 align:start position:0%
department handle that and are do you
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
have Personnel to help guide
 
01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.749 align:start position:0%
have Personnel to help guide
[Music]

01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
um and help with mitigation I guess in
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
those events um because as as you know
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
2023 was a catastrophic year so sure Lee
 
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
management plan is really intended to be
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensively look at what can happen
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
over the life of the landfill and we
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
know it's it's no you know it's clear to
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
us that there are going to be extreme
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
precipitation events both in terms of
 
01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
duration and intensity that are going to
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
stress those systems and so those
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
systems are uh required to be designed
 
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
to handle certain um level of uh
 
01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
precipitation event and in the case
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
where the more extreme events happen
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
there are Provisions made to store up to
 
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
12 in of leech heate on the liner and in
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
fact we have had you know a facility
 
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
that has had violation significant
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
violations of that which we've referred
 
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
to the Hampshire Department of Justice
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
um for for enforcement uh but with
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
respect to what we do in practice you
 
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
know we we know that those those events
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
do stress these systems and there are
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
the lee8 management plan and the and the
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
the contracts and such that that uh
 
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
operate are required to have should make
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
provision for handling that and and
 
01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
being able to realize there's going to
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
be an increased bulk of leech a that's
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
going to have to be managed for a period
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
of time and and then also to manage the
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
operations at the landfill to
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
effectively minimize the generation of
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
leech a because there are things you can
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
do to ensure that the bulk of the
 
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
precipitation that falls on a facility
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
um is collected and goes to storm water
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
collection before it ever contacts any
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
waste um so anything can do that that's
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
managed to storm water on the facility
 
01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
and doesn't have to be collected and
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
trucked off but anything that contacts
 
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
the waste should be collected in the
 
01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
lee8 management system and properly
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
handled as
 
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
lee8 thank you representative Penza and
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
you for my question I just want to
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
understand enforcement there's been um
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
hundreds of violation letters that have
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
been sent out so each one of those at
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
this point should have um penalties
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
could you tell me what the what the
 
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
amount of um monetary penalties have
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
been so far for all of these violation
 
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
letters in total the well to be clear I
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's been hundreds of
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
letters there were hundreds of examples
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
of individual days where there were
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
violations that occurred and we have a
 
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
number of enforcement documents that we
 
01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
issued for that facility that address
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
those that name those and identify them
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
and compel compliance the whole issue of
 
01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
um uh enforcement through any penalty
 
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
action has been referred to the New
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Justice and I'm
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately just not at Liberty to
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
discuss that until it's reconciled it's
 
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
still in
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
process okay representative
 
01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um before
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
with absent this law this act what does
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
the would the application for a permit
 
01:12:54.629 --> 01:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
address adequately address leech
 
01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
management I I someone earlier referred
 
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
to a gap is is that the Gap is the
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
detail sure an an application for a
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
permit today under today's statutory
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
language and under our today's
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules absolutely does
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
require that um before we give operating
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
approval for a facility a detailed lee8
 
01:13:17.629 --> 01:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
management plan needs to be included in
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
the operating plan for that facility and
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
that is subject to review and needs to
 
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
meet certain requirements it's reviewed
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
by Dees engineers and before that would
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
operating approval would be granted for
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
the facility we would look to that plan
 
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the operating plan
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
covers many things but with respect
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
specifically to leech a management that
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
it that it um describes an adequate and
 
01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
and compliant program for collecting
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
managing and disposing of leech
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
eight representative minor thank you
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
madam chairman let's just Suppose there
 
01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
is a catastrophic failure are the plans
 
01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
in place to deal with this once it gets
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
into the once it gets into the aquifer
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
so to so to speak the camels got their
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
nose underneath the tent M right so if
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
in the case of uh we have a robust
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
system of monitoring for landfills that
 
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
requires that um monitoring Wells be
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
placed around the perimeter of the
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
landfill to monitor groundwater quality
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
to detect whether the landfill is have
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
any adverse impacts on groundwater
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
quality around the facility in the cases
 
01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
where um detections of contaminant
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
are are made then um enhanced monitoring
 
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
happens and investigations are required
 
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
to identify the source of that whether
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
it's from a an errant problem with storm
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
water or whether it's an actual leech a
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
release or whatever it might be and then
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
if that's uh determined to be um at
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
issue then a corrective action plan is
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
required to address that U which could
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
which certainly includes stopping doing
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
whatever is necessary to to cease any
 
01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
release that's occurring but also can
 
01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
include a requirement to um treat any
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
contaminated groundwater to to restore
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
it to meet groundwater quality standards
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
followup followup thank you so once
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
again just let me be clear once once
 
01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
there is a catastrophe let's say in the
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
what and and you say there's some
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
mitigation plans in place but suppose it
 
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
goes beyond that suppose it you know it
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
gets out of control was mentioned
 
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
earlier uh there was 10 and something
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
inches of leech eight in these liners
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
they not designed for that right we
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
we've made it clear that that's
 
01:15:30.669 --> 01:15:30.679 align:start position:0%
non-compliant condition and and we're
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
seeking enforcement with respect than
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
you for that okay any other questions
 
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Bigby
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so um this is uh in some sense a
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Howard
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
Howard's question do you see this bill
 
01:15:49.709 --> 01:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
uh with a potential Amendment you heard
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
this morning as providing the department
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
with or potentially providing the
 
01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:55.910 align:start position:0%
with or potentially providing the
department

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
with uh tools to create better uh
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
leachate management plans going forward
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
I would say anytime um a particular
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
Authority is INS sconed in the statute
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
directly and explicitly that's can be
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
helpful to us yes thank you thank you
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um based upon the
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
information that I have researched um
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
over the the past 20 years of the for
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
example the Bethlehem facility has only
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
been charged $2,000 in civil penalties
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
um so do you are you saying that you
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the authority to impose fines
 
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
and if you're saying that do you just
 
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
send it over to the doj and wait and do
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know how many right now um are in
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
like holding pattern because $2,000 over
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
20 years doesn't seem like very
 
01:16:55.229 --> 01:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
much um
 
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
we absolutely have authority to seek
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
penalties we we if to the extent that we
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
are seeking civil penalties or criminal
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
sanctions then we are required to work
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Justice to
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
accomplish that they're the they're the
 
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
arm of state government that has the
 
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
authority to to address those things in
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
the courts but we work closely with them
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's not as though we WR we refer it and
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
then just wait to see what they do our
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
staff our compliance staff and our
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
Engineers work with them to make sure
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
they understand the severity of the
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
violations and the concern and and you
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
know any penalties that are being
 
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
recommended uh as far as uh past history
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
um maybe it's more than 20 years I
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
believe there was another penalty that
 
01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
was much more substantial than that that
 
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
was levied against that facility but it
 
01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
it may be more than 20 years ago that it
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
occurred it was on the order of around I
 
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
$200,000 representative Scully thank you
 
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
madam shair and thank you for being here
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
um do the lee8 management plans that the
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
department reviews do they specify what
 
01:18:01.229 --> 01:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
they anticipate to be the volume of lee8
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
and does your department require that an
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
excess volume of storage and treatment
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
be there to deal with some of these um
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
un you know planable events yeah I
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
generally those those plans would
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
include estimates of the amount of leech
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
a that would be generated and the
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
expectation is that the and the
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
requirement is that the applicant have
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh contracts and and
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
Outlet facilities that are capable of
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
managing both the routine uh everyday
 
01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
amounts of leech a as well as uh area
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
you know times of increased um
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
generation of leech he8 there are
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
certain times when increased leech a is
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
going to happen because of the stage of
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
construction that a particular cell is
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
at so that when you have more of a cell
 
01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
open to the precipitation you're going
 
01:18:51.629 --> 01:18:51.639 align:start position:0%
to have increased volumes of lee8 and
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
the expectation is the applicant always
 
01:18:54.159 --> 01:18:55.229 align:start position:0%
the expectation is the applicant always
has

01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
contractual um uh agreements with
 
01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
Wastewater facilities that can accept
 
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
those those
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
volumes okay uh quick followup so we do
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
not at this point specify any excess
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
capacity over and above what what
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
they're claiming to be the amount that's
 
01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:15.790 align:start position:0%
they're claiming to be the amount that's
being

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
generated I I'm not aware that there's a
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
rule that talks about excess Capac I
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
mean the again in practice what our
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
Engineers are doing is they're looking
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
at a Lee a management AG plan making an
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
assessment about whether it provides an
 
01:19:31.709 --> 01:19:31.719 align:start position:0%
adequate um that that it's estimating
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable reasonably what could be
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
generated at the facility and then
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
making sure there's a plan for managing
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
that safely I I haven't personally
 
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
reviewed these so I don't I don't really
 
01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
want to comment too too authoritatively
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
on that thank you okay representative
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so I'm like to get a little
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
bit back to the enforcement process and
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh so uh we have um articles about newsp
 
01:19:59.629 --> 01:19:59.639 align:start position:0%
newspaper articles about um what seemed
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
to be an excessive number of violations
 
01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.390 align:start position:0%
to be an excessive number of violations
in

01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
2024 uh at a particular landfill and you
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
have mentioned that uh you have re re uh
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
referred some of that issue to the
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and I'm just
 
01:20:17.709 --> 01:20:17.719 align:start position:0%
wondering uh are do you have limitations
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
about what you can say publicly when you
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
refer something to the Department of
 
01:20:23.229 --> 01:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
Justice and what's the typical time
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
scale that it takes them to Res to come
 
01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
out with a recommendation or a penalty
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yeah it's
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
certainly the case that I'm not at
 
01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
Liberty to discuss that case in any
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
detail at this point it wouldn't be
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do so while it's still in
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
process um the time period for these
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
sorts of things can be variable some
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
cases can be um sought and you know
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
initiated and settled fairly quickly or
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
or go to court um relatively quickly and
 
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
others may take more time it's it's
 
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
really I I don't think I think there's
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
an average we don't have a lot of these
 
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
cases and the reality is is that you
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
know from my perspective I mean I've
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
been spent much of my career allied with
 
01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh compliance and enforcement programs
 
01:21:08.669 --> 01:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
and um guys like me never think it's
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
fast enough that's just uh the way we're
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
wired but um uh I wish I could give you
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
an average but I don't think there
 
01:21:17.229 --> 01:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
really is
 
01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:19.149 align:start position:0%
really is
one

01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
followup so
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
um so so you said that you you can't
 
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
discuss that that case which I I'm not
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking you to discuss it but um
 
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the implications of
 
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
discussing it uh would discussing it um
 
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
create problems for the Department of
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
Justice to actually uh get the
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
information they need and create the
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
case without jeopardizing the the
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
ability to prosecute
 
01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
it I'm sorry I'm not sure I understand
 
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
your question okay so there are certain
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
things you need to keep confidential
 
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
and uh is the reason that you need to
 
01:21:59.950 --> 01:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
keep those confidential in order to
 
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
protect the ability of the doj to
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
actually prosecute the case right the I
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
think the general rule of thumb is and
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
it's a good one is that if you're in
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
engaged in enforcement that could end up
 
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
in litigation you should say nothing
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
about the case and outside of the the
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
actual activities of the case because it
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
just it you know if I say something
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
errant here or lless I'm going to end up
 
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
being deposed about it for8 hours when
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
if we go into litigation so there's no
 
01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
advantage to that did it disadvantages
 
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
the state's case whenever a state
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
employee who's involved in enforcement
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
discusses publicly the the details of
 
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
that case and followup followup so uh
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
and in terms of time scale uh I know
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
that you is highly variable but um it
 
01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
would be would you say it would be
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
really surprising to refer something to
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
the doj and get an get get something
 
01:22:59.070 --> 01:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
back in say a month or
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
two uh for a if if if we referring for
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
civil penalties yeah that would be very
 
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
that would be very fast i' would be
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
surprised to see if that happen thank
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions from the
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative Penza sorry
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby just brought up
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
some other things thank you madam chair
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
last question on this okay so I I think
 
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
he's talking about one thing I guess my
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
questions were down a different path so
 
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
if especially you know you have a you
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
have hundreds of violations that the
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
landfill knows that they're in violation
 
01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
of these are penalties there there comes
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
with a a case of that that's all public
 
01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge I'm not talking about further
 
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
investigations lawsuits or any of that
 
01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff I'm talking about cut and
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
dry where we know certain things that
 
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
are coming directly from the landfill or
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
coming directly from you coming from
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants that are all
 
01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
clear-cut violations which has fines why
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
can't we know the number of those that
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
have been that have been sent or that
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
are um that are up in the air at this
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
point um that shouldn't be a secret
 
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
that's public information um so that's
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
my first question is why wouldn't why
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
can't we get that information and there
 
01:24:17.229 --> 01:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be this need for this
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
investigation or any of that if these
 
01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
are clear-cut cases which a lot of them
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
are any documents that been issued to
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
the to the permite um or any documents
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
at all other than our Direct
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
Communications with the Department of
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
Justice relative to this enforcement
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
case are absolutely public and you're
 
01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
those are all available to this
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
committee or any member of the public
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so could um I'm
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
asking for the agency to send the
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
committee just so we have that a list of
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
every single violation that has taken
 
01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
place uh in the last two years for um
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
that landfill the Bethlehem landfill
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
please every single violation um I'd
 
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
love a a nice grouping of all of them
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
and if um if there is automatically in
 
01:25:11.629 --> 01:25:11.639 align:start position:0%
statute or in place certain um number
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
amounts of what those violations would
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
cost that would be helpful to have that
 
01:25:16.239 --> 01:25:18.189 align:start position:0%
cost that would be helpful to have that
as

01:25:18.189 --> 01:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%

shortly

01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%

session we were supposed to start at 11:
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
so we we have less time though uh to
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
discuss um several bills that we've
 
01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.510 align:start position:0%
discuss um several bills that we've
already

01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
heard so I'd like to start off um with
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
hb1 53 require requiring that two or
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
more law enforcement officers in this
 
01:27:02.189 --> 01:27:02.199 align:start position:0%
County receive training regarding animal
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
cruelty um representative ktoa you have
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
some information for us thank you madam
 
01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
chair I do have an amendment here that's
 
01:27:11.950 --> 01:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
been drafted by OS that I'd like to hand
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
out to the committee um quickly okay
 
01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:25.189 align:start position:0%
out to the committee um quickly okay
sure

01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
may I speak to this while we're passing
 
01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
it out absolutely may speak to this so
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
technically um this bill adds a couple
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the rsas that were excluded regarding
 
01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.030 align:start position:0%
of the rsas that were excluded regarding
the

01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
training but I think the important Point
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
here is under each section be of what we
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
heard uh the this line that says who is
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
able to respond to and or assist upon
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
request of local law enforcement
 
01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.229 align:start position:0%
request of local law enforcement
agencies

01:27:55.229 --> 01:27:55.239 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:27:55.239 --> 01:27:57.030 align:start position:0%
agencies
um

01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
so I think that was really a point that
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
people were worried
 
01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
about so it would be upon the request of
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
local foreign uh I think the word of
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
should be in there that's missing but if
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
you look at line
 
01:28:13.109 --> 01:28:13.119 align:start position:0%
18 and
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
line N9 and
 
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
change okay represent Howard
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative K do you think that this
 
01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
addresses that state policeman's
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about them ending up holding
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
the bag on these
 
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
cases I I I do because it's it's upon
 
01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
the request of local law enforcement so
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know I've sat in and listened to a
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
lot of people that are concerned because
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
you know the aoc's in the area are
 
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
concerned that um our Animal control
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
officer the acos excuse me um should uh
 
01:28:57.229 --> 01:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
might be overlooked or you know they
 
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
don't want their toes stepped on um this
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
would avoid make sure that that doesn't
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
happen um I know however based
 
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
on um the sheriff that testified is from
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
my County uh we actually get along very
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
well uh just for everyone's uh benefit
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
um but I actually had reason to call the
 
01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department on an animal abuse
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
case that a constituent kept calling and
 
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
calling about
 
01:29:27.109 --> 01:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
um during the heat wave that we had one
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
year regarding the horses that I
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned and local law enforcement had
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
no idea what they were doing there was
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
no ACO officer I called the sheriff's
 
01:29:37.870 --> 01:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
department he's like I can't step in I
 
01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
called the state vets office it's like
 
01:29:43.109 --> 01:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
we don't have we can't do this and so at
 
01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
one point the veterinarian did come out
 
01:29:47.229 --> 01:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
but then for the state vet and
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
everything else to happen it was another
 
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.470 align:start position:0%
everything else to happen it was another
10

01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
10
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
days so there there's a disconnect and
 
01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
when we listen to the sheriff
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
you know when we told him that they
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
actually had to be accompanied
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
by they didn't know the
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
law and I think one two people in each
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
County in law enforcement that
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
understands a law that's on the state
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
books I don't think that's a lot to
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
ask follow up yep um yeah sorry it was
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
the sheriff not the state police officer
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
and so so this would not
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
in this would take away the the
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
possibility that the jurisdiction would
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
fall would tumble down to the to the
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Office it would stay in it
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
would stay in the local
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
control it it could but it could not be
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
I mean we know that there are a lot of
 
01:30:42.669 --> 01:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire that are
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
small that don't have Animal Control
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
Officers and don't even really have a
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
full-time you know their Police
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
Department is so small they can't handle
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
these things we need some and the thing
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
is an animal control officer cannot do
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement they're not the law unless
 
01:31:03.229 --> 01:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
they are deputized they don't have that
 
01:31:05.709 --> 01:31:05.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism so you need
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
someone with the enforcement mechanism
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:13.719 align:start position:0%
in well I don't I think I think it was
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
pretty clear at least from testimony and
 
01:31:16.719 --> 01:31:17.870 align:start position:0%
pretty clear at least from testimony and
also

01:31:17.870 --> 01:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
from from what I've heard uh in other um
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
instances where animal cruelty neglect
 
01:31:29.229 --> 01:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
has been reported it's clear that law
 
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement needs to know
 
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
more about how to
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
enforce this or at least needs to know
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
more about what the statutes say because
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh it was clear to me that they don't
 
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah so um what I think
 
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
that um there
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
are there there are a couple of issues
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
here one is um
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh do does law enforcement need more
 
01:32:00.109 --> 01:32:00.119 align:start position:0%
education I think the the answer to that
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
is absolutely yeah and the question is
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
so the next question is what's the best
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism for getting that to them and
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
um I was uh I was particularly struck by
 
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
the testimony from the um from uh Mr I
 
01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
think it was sipa orp uh the uh sipa
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
from the uh law enforcement Training
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
Academy who uh spoke to the fact that um
 
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
it might that the way that that there
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
there exists a structure of task force
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
task forces for uh doing different
 
01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
aspects of law enforcement that um that
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
stru that's an existing structure and uh
 
01:32:49.629 --> 01:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
it it does enable law enforcement to get
 
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
the get people who know the topic to the
 
01:32:57.629 --> 01:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
right place at the right time uh and uh
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
I think that one of the issues with the
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
bill that uh as as it stands is that it
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
creates a structure that is not uh it's
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
not a structure that they deal with
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
already and so I think that moving
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
towards that task force structure might
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
be a better approach I'm also concerned
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
about the fact that it's going to cost
 
01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
money and there's no money in the bill
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh and um so I I think what we probably
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
ought to do is send this to uh
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for uh more detailed work
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
and get you know and get um members like
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
Mr sippa and some other members of law
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement to come in and help us craft
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
something that works more around the
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
task force approach sure representative
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
kto thank you madam chair and uh thank
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby um I think uh
 
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
that that would be a great idea for this
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
bill um I do think it does need some
 
01:33:59.709 --> 01:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
more study uh and uh I think we could
 
01:34:02.189 --> 01:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
get something really uh well written if
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
we do that great and I just like to make
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
a quick note that
 
01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
um I initially thought well maybe this
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
is something we should retain but then I
 
01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
looked I considered the deadline the
 
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
deadline is March 6 uh so it would have
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
to be out of committee a week before
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
that I think that should give us enough
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
time if we uh if we work on on it and um
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
given that all of our operations are
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
moving to Granite Place starting in the
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
fall is going to make it a lot more of a
 
01:34:36.669 --> 01:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
nuisance to do um to do uh retained
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
bills this term so if we can get this
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
out before the deadline I think that
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
great okay so I guess the uh
 
01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be for us to put
 
01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
this bill into the animal protection and
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
Licensing subcommittee
 
01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
uh I did send around a
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
um uh a list of our subcommittees and
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
who is appointed to each of the
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and representative Kwa you
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
happen to chair that
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so if you'd like to uh take
 
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
this bill and work further on it uh with
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
the um with the thought of incorporating
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
a task force uh I would be very pleased
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
to see that happen thank you madam chair
 
01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
it'd be my pleasure
 
01:35:27.719 --> 01:35:33.149 align:start position:0%
it'd be my pleasure
okay

01:35:33.149 --> 01:35:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
terrific all right um we have also a
 
01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
bill that we had heard HB 215 requiring
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
a landfill permit applicant to submit a
 
01:35:47.070 --> 01:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
report listing potential harms and
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
benefits of the project does anybody
 
01:35:52.109 --> 01:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
have a comment on that and I see
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative ger
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh when we held
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
the hearing on this uh on this bill uh I
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
took a number of notes based on comments
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
that uh members of the committee made
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
and I've identified three areas uh again
 
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
based on members comments where I think
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
there uh are opportunities to amend the
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh certainly things for us to talk
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
about what direction the bill might take
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh one certainly is a question about who
 
01:36:24.510 --> 01:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
chooses the independent third party
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh we had Amy manzelli here who I think
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
gave us a a good description of kind of
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
how the process works that it's it's an
 
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
ongoing dialogue about the the third
 
01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
party uh who is equipped to do that work
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
um but the bill should probably be
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
amended to be more specific about that
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
process it was one thing I heard another
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
question that came up uh which I think
 
01:36:50.109 --> 01:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
as a committee we need to discuss is
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not it should apply to
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
expansions of um existing
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
landfills uh and then finally uh a
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion that was made by director
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
whims that I think is worthy of looking
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
into more is whether or not we might
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
have an initial screening process that
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
would have the net benefit component uh
 
01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
as the first part of an analysis before
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
it then goes on to consideration for
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
other aspects of the permitting process
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
so those were based on members comments
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
the three areas that I thought
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
um were good for discussion of possible
 
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment who chooses a third party does
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
it apply to expansions and should we
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
have a two-stage screening uh process
 
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so um I think
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
that uh I think that uh two out of those
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
three of those definitely need more
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
should should include more work I think
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
that the who Cho who chooses a third
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
party is really critical and I think
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
that that needs to be clarified from
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
what St in the current bill and I think
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
that the initial screening process makes
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense I think that would be
 
01:38:03.589 --> 01:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
good both for industry and for uh you
 
01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
know all of the uh stakeholders because
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh if you if if something needs to go
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
back to the drawing board you want to
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
learn that earlier rather than later uh
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of does it apply to
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
expansions I think that with existing
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
landfills there is a fairly reasonable
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
argument to be made made that um the the
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
harms and benefits of an existing
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
landfill are already pretty well known
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
and uh I I think uh attorney maneli
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
talked about uh you know every every
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
project has harms and benefits and then
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
but it's the ones that are really out of
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
bounds that you need you most need to
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
watch out for I think that with existing
 
01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
landfills You Don't See You Don't See
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
ones that the ones are already out of
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
bounds you know about already and that's
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
that has that has to get rectified in in
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
another way but
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of the general
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
operations what's the way it the this uh
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
the harms and benefits are pretty well
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
known for that so I don't think that
 
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
this it you definitely need you
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to create more
 
01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
paperwork about
 
01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:18.709 align:start position:0%
paperwork about
[Music]

01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
those representative H Haskins thank you
 
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair um so rep Bixby are you
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
saying that expansions of existing
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
landfills don't need
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
this yes I'm I'm saying that expansions
 
01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
don't need this because the point of
 
01:39:39.550 --> 01:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
doing the harm benefit analysis is to
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
find out or to to do uh to make as
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable a prediction as possible
 
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
about what's going to happen on a site
 
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been developed yet if the
 
01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:53.719 align:start position:0%
site is already developed the patterns
 
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
of traffic are known the patterns of uh
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
of noise complaints or odor complaints
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
are already known those fall into the
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
category of things that need to be
 
01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
rectified if they are outside the permit
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
bounds as opposed to things that we need
 
01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
to do an analysis of I recollect though
 
01:40:17.229 --> 01:40:17.239 align:start position:0%
discussing the fact that a
 
01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
1400 acre parcel that might be expanded
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
as one one section closes and another
 
01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
opens might indeed have you know air
 
01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
going a different direction might have
 
01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
soil that's slightly different than the
 
01:40:37.589 --> 01:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
one in the corner of the uh parcel
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
that's been uh closed down so I actually
 
01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
think that expansion should be part of
 
01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:45.189 align:start position:0%
think that expansion should be part of
the

01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
01:40:50.669 --> 01:40:50.679 align:start position:0%
ger thank you uh Madam chair I
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
personally I think that I think the
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
argument can be made that a modified
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
version of this might apply to
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
expansions my sense is just as we're
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
talking here I probably would prefer in
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
this bill not to include expansions and
 
01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
then we could return to the question of
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
whether a modified process might apply
 
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
to expansions I think that something
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
similar absolutely makes sense as
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins points out but
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
as representative Bixby has pointed out
 
01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:19.719 align:start position:0%
it is a different set of questions with
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
existing conditions as opposed to a site
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
that is brand new so um that's some one
 
01:41:26.189 --> 01:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
of the things I would throw out there's
 
01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
the possibility that for the time being
 
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
we exempt expansions uh and return in
 
01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
the future to the possibility of a
 
01:41:36.589 --> 01:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
modified process okay uh representative
 
01:41:40.589 --> 01:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
guber uh thank you um I think the idea
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
of expansions should be looked at but I
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should tie down this
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
bill with another whole area uh on
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
expansions there are incremental impacts
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
and we should at least look at those
 
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
particularly if people have lived uh
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
near a landfill for many years and
 
01:41:58.750 --> 01:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
they're hoping the truck traffic would
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
slow down when that it's filled so I
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
don't think we should discount the
 
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
people who live there into the future
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know um but I think it's a very
 
01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
different type of situation that will
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
take really a study first and uh it
 
01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
would definitely derail this bill if we
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
tried to solve it now so my proposal we
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
take a set track on that thank you
 
01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.669 align:start position:0%
take a set track on that thank you
representative

01:42:20.669 --> 01:42:20.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah um I agree with
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative guber on this uh on this
 
01:42:29.589 --> 01:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
point um I think that if we're I think
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
we have to be specific in this bill and
 
01:42:33.589 --> 01:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about something that is
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
brand new and um and keeping that track
 
01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
for permitting brand new um I do believe
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
that um that information there's a lot
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
of information that's readily available
 
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
um that could be comprised from an
 
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
existing landfill that's looking to
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
expand and uh I think that we could take
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
another bite of that at a different time
 
01:42:56.109 --> 01:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
but for this bill and this bill alone I
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
think it's serving its purpose for that
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
agree any other representative Bixby
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so it sounds like um we uh we have
 
01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
a general idea of where should this
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
should be going going going forward and
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
I think that it probably needs to go to
 
01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
the solid waste
 
01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:16.310 align:start position:0%
the solid waste
subcommittee

01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair um when doing
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
the when looking at this bill my
 
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
question is is one who's going to
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
determine net Ben public
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
benefit um we do have a definition of
 
01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
public benefit but there is no
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
definition of net public benefit and so
 
01:43:40.109 --> 01:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking that's just a question
 
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
which can be uh discussed in the
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
gerana uh thank you madam chair and and
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
I think represent comto for the question
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent question I agree it's
 
01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
what the subcommittee can talk about and
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
and the director has indicated in his
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
comments that he can imagine some type
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
of initial screening phase that would
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
bring in experts so I think we have an
 
01:44:04.589 --> 01:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
initial idea of what that might look
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
like and I think the subcommittee can
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
definitely work closer with the to
 
01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:09.550 align:start position:0%
definitely work closer with the to
refine

01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
refine
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
that okay any other questions comments
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
about that bill okay so that
 
01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:19.239 align:start position:0%
bill uh will'll be uh visiting the uh
 
01:44:21.550 --> 01:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
solid was subcommittee uh representative
 
01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
King you are chair of that
 
01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
um and uh I guess you'll make
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
arrangements to meet as soon as you can
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
and discuss this and come up with an
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that incorporates what people
 
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
are seeking for for this bill um moving
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
along we have HB 240 which is removing
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
the penalty of forfeiture for
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
non-payment of dog
 
01:44:50.589 --> 01:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
licenses anybody have any comments or
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
questions about that representative
 
01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so I think that uh this is
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
one of those cases where there was a
 
01:45:02.109 --> 01:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
real problem that uh was brought to us
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
and the solution was uh not the right
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
solution uh I think that uh the forer
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
statute really needs to stay in place
 
01:45:13.629 --> 01:45:13.639 align:start position:0%
but I think that adding one sentence to
 
01:45:17.550 --> 01:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
that statute that explicitly says that
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh the uh Municipal officials have the
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
capacity to provide a little bit of
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
leeway in order to uh improve compliance
 
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh would be in order and if uh if people
 
01:45:31.950 --> 01:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
agree that that's not that's a
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable idea i' uh unless anyone else
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
wants to jump on and do that Amendment
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
I'd be willing to do that Amendment and
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
then bring it to the animal subcommittee
 
01:45:44.589 --> 01:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
okay terrific uh representative Howard
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative Bixby uh
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
that that very little is required and I
 
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
believe that the sponsor agreed with us
 
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
in the room that that it that was just
 
01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
as simple as
 
01:45:58.589 --> 01:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
that uh didn't he send didn't uh
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative um Manion send along a
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
suggested language did you did everybody
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
see that I did not see
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
that okay I I believe he sent something
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
to me I thought he sent it to the entire
 
01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
committee I will forward that on to you
 
01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby and um if you could
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
craft the amendment uh we can have that
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
for maybe next week speak y okay
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
super okay then uh we heard the bill
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
hb21 prohibiting the removal of Claws
 
01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:35.830 align:start position:0%
hb21 prohibiting the removal of Claws
from

01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:40.189 align:start position:0%
 
cats

01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
okay anybody have any comment on that
 
01:46:45.870 --> 01:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
bill that we
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
heard representative ger thank you madam
 
01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
chair I'll I'll only say that I know we
 
01:46:55.390 --> 01:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
have this question uh this debate every
 
01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:56.870 align:start position:0%
have this question uh this debate every
time

01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
about you know statistics and and
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not we can ever really have
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
reliable statistics I I I think we can't
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
I think the fact that so many of the the
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarians that we hear from say it's
 
01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
a disreputable practice um means that in
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
all likelihood some of the people who
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
are doing it are not going to be
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
reporting I think it's it's simply not
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable to say that that we can't go
 
01:47:23.550 --> 01:47:23.560 align:start position:0%
forward unless we have
 
01:47:25.229 --> 01:47:25.239 align:start position:0%
really accurate statistics because we'll
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
never have them in in my mind uh even
 
01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
the the folks who testified in
 
01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill recognize that it
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
does happen some percentage of the time
 
01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
and the number of cats that we have in
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
our shelters who have been declawed we
 
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of those are New
 
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how many are not but it's
 
01:47:45.149 --> 01:47:45.159 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to assume if they're all
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
not New Hampshire cats to me that's
 
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
evidence that it's happening and and
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
from my perspective that is enough to
 
01:47:55.149 --> 01:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
move forward with with uh support for
 
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
the bill okay I want to point the
 
01:48:01.229 --> 01:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
committee out uh to a addendum that was
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
sent out by our committee researcher
 
01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
Christy Al
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
aleser who um she she did we did she did
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
Supply a memo uh with some research
 
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
about the past bills and um that we
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
considered on Cat dclaw and noticed a
 
01:48:21.149 --> 01:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
mistake in her
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
research uh regarding the second section
 
01:48:27.149 --> 01:48:27.159 align:start position:0%
um she misread the survey question in
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
the 2020 data from the New Hampshire
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medical
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
Association in actuality the question
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
read do you provide any similar services
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
such as tail docking ear cropping do
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
claw removal Etc that may be considered
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
illegal with passing of New Hampshire
 
01:48:42.119 --> 01:48:42.950 align:start position:0%
illegal with passing of New Hampshire
Bill

01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:48:45.149 --> 01:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
1387 this question does not mention
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
declaw at all do claws are the rear
 
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
claws on a dog that can be removed
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
because they can get caught and ripped
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
off so um those 146
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
responses uh did not have anything to do
 
01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
with um
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
declawing and uh so I just wanted to
 
01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:09.719 align:start position:0%
point out this addendum to the committee
 
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
as you consider this personally I am I
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
am not in support of this bill I think
 
01:49:18.430 --> 01:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
first of all it does undermine
 
01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
Veterinary autonomy we haven't to this
 
01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
point been telling veterinarians what
 
01:49:25.709 --> 01:49:25.719 align:start position:0%
they can and cannot do what um in terms
 
01:49:25.719 --> 01:49:26.669 align:start position:0%
they can and cannot do what um in terms
of

01:49:26.669 --> 01:49:26.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
procedures um I do think as in I'm
 
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
seeing you know so many bills across the
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
country uh similar bills coming to other
 
01:49:36.719 --> 01:49:37.669 align:start position:0%
country uh similar bills coming to other
State

01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
State
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
legislatures uh with this exact same um
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition I'm I'm seeing that it's a a
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
Gateway for restricting other procedures
 
01:49:48.669 --> 01:49:48.679 align:start position:0%
for our
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
veterinarians I also believe very
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
strongly that by Banning it it limits
 
01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:56.390 align:start position:0%
strongly that by Banning it it limits
the

01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
veterinarians ability to have
 
01:50:02.589 --> 01:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
conversations with their clients about
 
01:50:04.990 --> 01:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
decoying if you're Banning something
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
completely there's no opportunity for
 
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
somebody to come in and say I want to
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
declaw my cat and for the veterinarian
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
to then educate them about how bad it is
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
or what what's wrong with it or or even
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
what they can do for behavior
 
01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:23.830 align:start position:0%
what they can do for behavior
modification

01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
modification
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh for the animal to you know do other
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
things uh other than this very last
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
ditch effort to uh control a behavior um
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
but mostly it's not a common practice or
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
significant issue in New Hampshire that
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
I can see um and very very small
 
01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of cats experience any kind
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
of Behavioral changes following deying
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
many many owners have contacted me and
 
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
let me know that you know they have a
 
01:50:57.149 --> 01:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
declawed cat and they have had had no
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
problem using the litter box or biting
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
or doing any of these other things that
 
01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
U people have have uh testified to so
 
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
you know I don't endorse decoying as a
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
first option I think you know it's just
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
like with landfilling it's like the last
 
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
thing you want to do decl is the last
 
01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
thing that you want to do and we have to
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
have um an area a space where our
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
veterinarians can have a conver ation
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
with their clients about why they
 
01:51:27.629 --> 01:51:27.639 align:start position:0%
shouldn't and I see um the market is
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
moving more towards you know it has
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
moved significantly from the even the
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
1990s away from this procedure naturally
 
01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
because people don't like it um so for
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
all those reasons and more um I just I
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
can't support this
 
01:51:48.030 --> 01:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
bill representative Freeman thank you
 
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
madam chairman thank you for so
 
01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
eloquently spelling that out because I I
 
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
share that sentiment along with the fact
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
that I had a lot of um um Pro this bill
 
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
groups call me about it and I was I was
 
01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:05.679 align:start position:0%
on the fence um there was compelling
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
testimony on either side of the issue
 
01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
but the thing that narrowed it down for
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
me is numbers I'm a numbers person I
 
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
need to see numbers and we don't have
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
any way to know how many of these
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
procedures are occurring in the state
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
how many procedures have the Vets talked
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
to with their clients about this and
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
really what is the overall practice and
 
01:52:28.270 --> 01:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
there really was no tangible evidence
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
that putting a ban in place would
 
01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
mitigate any of those things so again I
 
01:52:35.069 --> 01:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for so eloquently
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
pointing out why um I as well don't feel
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
this bill should go forward thank you uh
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
chair with respect I do support the bill
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe it's taking agency
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
away from the Vets I think cat owners
 
01:52:52.589 --> 01:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
will still bring their cats into the
 
01:52:54.669 --> 01:52:54.679 align:start position:0%
that and they can have whatever
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
conversation they need to have um while
 
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
I wish there were hard numbers I think
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
we do know that it's happening there's
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
enough anecdotal evidence to support
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
that and I don't think that law should
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
be a statement of who we are but I think
 
01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:14.669 align:start position:0%
be a statement of who we are but I think
this

01:53:14.669 --> 01:53:14.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:53:18.629 --> 01:53:18.639 align:start position:0%
time who we are is that we think it is a
 
01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
cruel practice so I believe it it should
 
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
be outlawed and and i would support that
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative Miner thank you madam
 
01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't I I don't I can't
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
support this bill I don't see it that
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
that it's our responsibility nor our
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
duty to tell uh veterinarians um what
 
01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
they can and cannot do in their practice
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
um It's a Long Reach for us and um I
 
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
just can't support it if we if we
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
support this what's next
 
01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
I I uh no I can't support this thank you
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so I I think that
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh we are at a we are at a position
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
where uh it is clear that some people on
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
this committee feel that the bill should
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
pass others feel it should not and I
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
don't think that any more discussion at
 
01:54:09.629 --> 01:54:09.639 align:start position:0%
this point is going to change that those
 
01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
positions uh but the so the key question
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
is is there anything that can that would
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
need to be done to amend this bill for
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
any purpose and my sense is no the bill
 
01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
either passes or fails as it is and we
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
should just put it on exec and each
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
person will make their own decision
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
based on uh the uh the the the ways they
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
choose to evaluate the Bill thank you
 
01:54:36.119 --> 01:54:37.270 align:start position:0%
choose to evaluate the Bill thank you
representative

01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
ktoa uh well I I was going to say now
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
that uh represent Bixby decided uh he
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
made a good point and I was just going
 
01:54:47.550 --> 01:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
to bring up the fact that you know in
 
01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
speaking with different veterinarians
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
and folks um my veterinarian in
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
particular has did one declaw in 5 years
 
01:55:02.350 --> 01:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
um his when people would bring PE um
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
when the owners would bring in the
 
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
patients he would discuss the procedures
 
01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh obviously only one in five years uh
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
they all opted not to uh the one that he
 
01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
did do it was that or euthanized the
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
cat um so
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
and the owner was very passionate about
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
her uh
 
01:55:32.109 --> 01:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
animal um and I think we have to respect
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
that um and just knowing my vet and you
 
01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:37.830 align:start position:0%
that um and just knowing my vet and you
know

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:39.990 align:start position:0%
know
he

01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh he
 
01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
understands and I don't know and I
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
haven't talked to any and we've talked
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
to the abma and we've talked to
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
different vets
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
that the first course of action for
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
anyone bringing in a cat for decla is
 
01:55:58.750 --> 01:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
educating them and once most people are
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
educated they ought not
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
to but this is a doctor patient uh
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
relationship and by Banning that you're
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
taking away that
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
relationship represent Penza you had
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
something you wanted to
 
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
say otherwise we can move
 
01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
on yeah I just um in just in resp
 
01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
response to representative Bixby I
 
01:56:25.390 --> 01:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
actually think that the bill should be
 
01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
amended I think that I could support the
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
bill if it was amended I would want the
 
01:56:34.109 --> 01:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
penalties removed I would want uh on I
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
can't pronounce it I would want the U
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
the term defined I would want an ad I
 
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:41.800 align:start position:0%
would want I would want this bill to be
 
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
different I don't like how it's um I
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
don't like how it's um been designed and
 
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
and to me after it failed the first time
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
like it failed the first year why wasn't
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
a bill put in why wasn't it amended to
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
get the data that we're looking for to
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
get the data from every single shelter
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire to find
 
01:57:02.669 --> 01:57:02.679 align:start position:0%
out where the numbers are to get the
 
01:57:04.669 --> 01:57:04.679 align:start position:0%
data from from vets that are performing
 
01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
it so I mean I just I think that there
 
01:57:10.030 --> 01:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
should be things that are in here that
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
change for example I um the general
 
01:57:14.830 --> 01:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
court affirms our trust in the expertise
 
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
compassion and ethical Judgment of
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
licensed New Hampshire veterinarians to
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
make decisions in the best interest of
 
01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
animals under their care I think those
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
things need to be said in here because
 
01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
we have heard both sides of the story
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
here and I don't know what's true I do I
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
know I did my due diligence last time I
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
don't like how the bill is organized
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
because I think it it it opens the door
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
for this tattletail type mentality and
 
01:57:43.629 --> 01:57:43.639 align:start position:0%
uh I think that's a slippery slope
 
01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
besides other things like that um I want
 
01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:49.639 align:start position:0%
the data I I would love this to I would
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
love this to be in statute to say we
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
don't do them except if it's medically
 
01:57:57.310 --> 01:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
necessary for the cat and then there
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
could be a caveat there of course
 
01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
medically necessary for the owner and
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
I'd be fine with it and remove the
 
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
penalties but it doesn't seem as if we
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
just keep doing the same thing over and
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
over and expecting different results so
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
I will not I can't support it how it
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
currently is if someone's willing to do
 
01:58:18.189 --> 01:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
an amendment um to get this to a place
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
where I think we could all and to
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
include both parties the the Vets as
 
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
well as everyone that is against this
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
this is a barbaric procedure everybody
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
knows that if I read anything else about
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
it I'm going lose my mind I've had a
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
gazillion calls from this from my local
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
constituents and uh I want to be able to
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
support something but not in its current
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
version thank you representative H
 
01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
Haskins and then representative Kenny
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
then I guess we'll have to go to lunch
 
01:58:49.149 --> 01:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
sure one last comment I don't want to
 
01:58:52.109 --> 01:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
hold up lunch I was schooled by an
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
deemed colleague that the slippery slope
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
argument is a fallacy as taught in
 
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
rhetoric that's
 
01:59:04.589 --> 01:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
all thank you representative
 
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
Kenny uh yes um I worked at a veterinary
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
hospital for 21 years we did declaw by
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
taking just the nail
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
off and the incision was closed with
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
glue and the um Veterinary would close
 
01:59:25.709 --> 01:59:25.719 align:start position:0%
it off with glue we would have the
 
01:59:28.510 --> 01:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
client put the cats on shredded
 
01:59:33.149 --> 01:59:33.159 align:start position:0%
newspaper for 2 weeks and those cats did
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
fine this was 21 years and we had no
 
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
trouble this whole thing about taking
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
off an entire knuckle was the old way of
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
doing things not the new way I have
 
01:59:50.709 --> 01:59:50.719 align:start position:0%
people the clients that were what we had
 
01:59:53.310 --> 01:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
had cats for many many years after we
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
declawed them that way we did not do the
 
01:59:58.270 --> 01:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
back claws so they could still climb a
 
02:00:01.069 --> 02:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
tree if they needed to this whole thing
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
about taking the whole entire knuckle
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
off is
 
02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
wrong I watched it for years close the
 
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
incision up with glue let them heal with
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
newspaper and there was no trouble I
 
02:00:21.069 --> 02:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
don't know this whole thing is just if
 
02:00:25.069 --> 02:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
it if an veterinarian we shouldn't be
 
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
questioning what they do with
 
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
surgeries it's not right representative
 
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
Bixby so um we have one more bill that
 
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:38.360 align:start position:0%
needs to that we need to address before
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
and that it would be good to dress
 
02:00:44.069 --> 02:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
before we go to lunch and uh and I think
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
that there are two possible ways of
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
going about the uh the declaw Bill one
 
02:00:51.149 --> 02:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
is to look into the possibility of
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
amendment I think that it might make
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
sense to have a straw poll to see how
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
many people would be interested in
 
02:00:59.790 --> 02:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
amending it but before we do that I just
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
like to recommend that we send the bill
 
02:01:05.790 --> 02:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
that we heard this morning to uh the
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
solid way study committee uh uh for
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment because uh the prime sponsor
 
02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
does have an amendment that he wants to
 
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
work on with
 
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
that okay um fine with that anybody else
 
02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
have a issue with that okay so we would
 
02:01:25.470 --> 02:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
be then sending HB 566 to the solid
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
waste subcommittee to uh refine an
 
02:01:31.310 --> 02:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
amendment to that all right I'm good
 
02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
with that um and as so far as the
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
um uh the cat claw bill um I I I think I
 
02:01:44.069 --> 02:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
don't know that I want to waste the time
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh doing um a whole rework of the bill
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's not our job really to rewrite
 
02:01:52.990 --> 02:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
somebody else's bill
 
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.589 align:start position:0%
somebody else's bill
um

02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:57.870 --> 02:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know I'm sure that if we
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
don't if this bill doesn't pass I'm sure
 
02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to see it back again so
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
maybe at that point we could have H A
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
bill that uh maybe makes a little bit
 
02:02:11.550 --> 02:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
more sense in one way shape or form but
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I think we should move
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
on with that I'm going to adjourn us for
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
lunch and see you back at 1:00 when we
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
will begin hearings on on a couple of
 
02:02:22.679 --> 02:02:23.709 align:start position:0%
will begin hearings on on a couple of
more

02:02:23.709 --> 02:02:23.719 align:start position:0%

02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:28.589 align:start position:0%
bills uh today let's see which ones
that's

02:02:28.589 --> 02:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:02:32.589 --> 02:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
uh HB 355 which should take all of 15
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
minutes to hear um HB 179 HB 171 and hr3

the group's support that I introduced
 
03:06:25.870 --> 03:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
this bill just uh quickly I can run down
 
03:06:28.229 --> 03:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
the background of the of the working
 
03:06:30.190 --> 03:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
group back in
 
03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
2019 I also chaired a legislative study
 
03:06:39.309 --> 03:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
committee um that issued a report and it
 
03:06:42.349 --> 03:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
was to study recycling streams and solid
 
03:06:45.469 --> 03:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
waste in New Hampshire and one of the
 
03:06:48.710 --> 03:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations coming out of that study
 
03:06:52.710 --> 03:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
committee um was that there be created
 
03:06:55.309 --> 03:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
here in the state a stakeholder group
 
03:06:59.630 --> 03:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
representing uh the solid waste uh issue
 
03:07:02.750 --> 03:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
from folks all over the place and um it
 
03:07:04.830 --> 03:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
was also thought that this would be a
 
03:07:10.030 --> 03:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
good kind of um connection for Dees
 
03:07:13.389 --> 03:07:13.399 align:start position:0%
because uh one of the requirements once
 
03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
the group was uh created was to work
 
03:07:22.510 --> 03:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
with de s on a um Solid Waste Management
 
03:07:25.510 --> 03:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
plan it was a long range plan and uh if
 
03:07:26.990 --> 03:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
you've been on this committee you
 
03:07:29.630 --> 03:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
probably know it was about 20 years late
 
03:07:32.070 --> 03:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
in being issued but the great news is
 
03:07:34.830 --> 03:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
that it has been issued um and we did
 
03:07:38.710 --> 03:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
work with Dees on its development the
 
03:07:42.309 --> 03:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
other thing that we are responsible for
 
03:07:47.870 --> 03:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
is to um review all sorts of alternative
 
03:07:50.269 --> 03:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
to approve improve the solid waste
 
03:07:52.429 --> 03:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
management here in the state of New
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um also to support the
 
03:07:59.429 --> 03:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
solid waste management plan goals and
 
03:08:01.630 --> 03:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
one of those goals as many of you also
 
03:08:04.590 --> 03:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
know is that we have a newly adopt Solid
 
03:08:04.600 --> 03:08:05.910 align:start position:0%
know is that we have a newly adopt Solid
Waste

03:08:05.910 --> 03:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
Waste
 
03:08:08.990 --> 03:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
diversion uh goal statute and we're
 
03:08:14.229 --> 03:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to um decrease the tonage going
 
03:08:17.550 --> 03:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
into landfills and waste energy plants
 
03:08:21.870 --> 03:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
of solid waste uh 25% by 2030 which
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
isn't that far away and then 45% by 2050
 
03:08:28.510 --> 03:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
so those are all the sorts of things
 
03:08:33.950 --> 03:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
that we're um that we're working on um
 
03:08:36.269 --> 03:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
it's a very I know there's a lot of
 
03:08:39.030 --> 03:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
concern about creating new commissions
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
or extending commissions that are more
 
03:08:43.990 --> 03:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
abund if there's anything this
 
03:08:46.990 --> 03:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
commission isn't it's more abund we work
 
03:08:52.750 --> 03:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
on it's not morand it um we work a lot
 
03:08:55.710 --> 03:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
we meet regularly even though we're not
 
03:08:59.030 --> 03:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
required to we've been issuing um annual
 
03:09:02.110 --> 03:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
interim reports to talk about the work
 
03:09:05.110 --> 03:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
that we've been doing
 
03:09:09.550 --> 03:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
um and also because you're on Ena you
 
03:09:12.110 --> 03:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
probably know that we have supported
 
03:09:15.070 --> 03:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
several bills through the working group
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
um one was to uh ban the disposal of one
 
03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
ton uh generators of more or more food
 
03:09:27.349 --> 03:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
waste B that disposal in landfills and
 
03:09:31.389 --> 03:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
requiring it to be composted and that is
 
03:09:33.790 --> 03:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
about to become effective February 1 so
 
03:09:36.150 --> 03:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
maybe you've seen the media on that and
 
03:09:38.229 --> 03:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
that will um help us towards our
 
03:09:41.590 --> 03:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
diversion goal we also successfully
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
supported um a bill to create and fund
 
03:09:49.389 --> 03:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
uh the solid Waste Management fund and
 
03:09:52.750 --> 03:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
that is a grant program for Waste
 
03:09:54.830 --> 03:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
diversion for municipalities and
 
03:09:57.429 --> 03:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
businesses we've got um a million
 
03:09:59.550 --> 03:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
dollars in that and that's about to kick
 
03:10:05.269 --> 03:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
off last time uh the we supported a bill
 
03:10:07.750 --> 03:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
to ban the sale of consumer products
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
with intentionally added pasas Banning
 
03:10:13.550 --> 03:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
the disposal of lithium ion batteries
 
03:10:17.349 --> 03:10:17.359 align:start position:0%
which are a huge risk in landfills um
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
and to authorize the inclusion of waste
 
03:10:23.150 --> 03:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
diversion plans in town Master plans so
 
03:10:26.309 --> 03:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
we've been we've supported legislation
 
03:10:27.990 --> 03:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:10:31.550 --> 03:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
Meaningful uh supports our Solid Waste
 
03:10:34.510 --> 03:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
Management plan goals and also has been
 
03:10:37.429 --> 03:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
supported by the legislature and the
 
03:10:40.990 --> 03:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
governors so um I'm I'm proud of the
 
03:10:43.389 --> 03:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
work that that we've done and we'd
 
03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
really like to be able to continue the
 
03:10:47.870 --> 03:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
work and that's why this bill would
 
03:10:50.510 --> 03:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
extend the term of the solid waste
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
working group for five years so the
 
03:10:58.590 --> 03:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
lastly uh what is proposed in this
 
03:11:02.349 --> 03:11:02.359 align:start position:0%
legislation is to replace nerk uh which
 
03:11:04.750 --> 03:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
is a terrific organization but it's a
 
03:11:07.309 --> 03:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
regional organization it's not based in
 
03:11:10.150 --> 03:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and ever since the
 
03:11:14.349 --> 03:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
creation of um of the working group I
 
03:11:16.670 --> 03:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
think nerk in the very beginning a
 
03:11:18.469 --> 03:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
representative have attended twice
 
03:11:20.110 --> 03:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
remotely and they really haven't
 
03:11:22.750 --> 03:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
attended any meetings and the and the
 
03:11:25.830 --> 03:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
nerk executive director doesn't really
 
03:11:28.429 --> 03:11:28.439 align:start position:0%
feel that they'll be able to um
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
participate much in the future and she
 
03:11:34.389 --> 03:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
supports being removed from the
 
03:11:37.630 --> 03:11:37.640 align:start position:0%
commission um and then in an effort to
 
03:11:41.670 --> 03:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
make uh the working group uh more State
 
03:11:45.429 --> 03:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
focused to improve its analysis and its
 
03:11:47.830 --> 03:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholder representation
 
03:11:52.870 --> 03:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
HB 355 proposes to uh replace nerk with
 
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
a representative of the society for
 
03:11:57.870 --> 03:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
protection of New Hampshire forest and
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
they obviously are concerned about water
 
03:12:02.990 --> 03:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
and land and Air in the state of New
 
03:12:05.830 --> 03:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's a voice I think has
 
03:12:08.070 --> 03:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
been missing on the stakeholder group
 
03:12:11.790 --> 03:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
and we'd love to have them join us and I
 
03:12:14.110 --> 03:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
believe there's a representative of the
 
03:12:17.790 --> 03:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
society here but um having spoken with
 
03:12:21.309 --> 03:12:21.319 align:start position:0%
him um I believe they are interested in
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
joining the commission so on that basis
 
03:12:27.830 --> 03:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
I urge the committee um on behalf of the
 
03:12:30.070 --> 03:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
working group to recommend passage of
 
03:12:32.229 --> 03:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
this bill extending uh the term for
 
03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
another five years and replacing nerk uh
 
03:12:38.670 --> 03:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
with um someone from the society and I'd
 
03:12:40.750 --> 03:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
be happy to take your questions thank
 
03:12:43.309 --> 03:12:43.319 align:start position:0%

03:12:45.110 --> 03:12:45.120 align:start position:0%

03:12:47.269 --> 03:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
working group
 
03:12:49.110 --> 03:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me being appointed by the house
 
03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
as the house representative on that
 
03:12:53.389 --> 03:12:53.399 align:start position:0%

03:12:56.469 --> 03:12:56.479 align:start position:0%
especially under your chairmanship and I
 
03:12:59.110 --> 03:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time uh taken by all
 
03:13:01.870 --> 03:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
interested parties and stakeholders uh
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
to discuss and pursue and investigate
 
03:13:08.389 --> 03:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
and explore all the different aspects of
 
03:13:11.670 --> 03:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
our solid waste policy in the state so
 
03:13:15.070 --> 03:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
um I am in full support of this bill and
 
03:13:17.429 --> 03:13:17.439 align:start position:0%

regularly to meet the demands of a
 
03:13:34.070 --> 03:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
commission when we don't want so many
 
03:13:35.389 --> 03:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
commissions that aren't meeting
 
03:13:38.469 --> 03:13:38.479 align:start position:0%

I could okay thank um I I just want to
 
03:13:54.150 --> 03:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
say on and this was something I I had
 
03:13:55.750 --> 03:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
meant to say when I was originally
 
03:13:59.389 --> 03:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
testifying I for uh about a year and a
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
half chaired two different uh committees
 
03:14:04.910 --> 03:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
that were responsible for reviewing
 
03:14:09.190 --> 03:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
every single uh statutory commission and
 
03:14:11.790 --> 03:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
uh Committee in existence at the state
 
03:14:14.510 --> 03:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
at that time and it was almost 250 of
 
03:14:18.190 --> 03:14:18.200 align:start position:0%
them and um we worked
 
03:14:20.830 --> 03:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
diligently uh and also there we were
 
03:14:23.429 --> 03:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
talking about executive orders that had
 
03:14:26.309 --> 03:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
created such things and we worked very
 
03:14:29.429 --> 03:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
diligently to recommend repeals uh of
 
03:14:32.349 --> 03:14:32.359 align:start position:0%
ones that deserve to be repealed and
 
03:14:36.030 --> 03:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
were more abund um and also to try to
 
03:14:39.870 --> 03:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
put more um oomph into the statutes that
 
03:14:42.670 --> 03:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
allowed their their creation I also
 
03:14:44.269 --> 03:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
served last year on the special
 
03:14:47.070 --> 03:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
committee on commissions so I'm pretty
 
03:14:49.590 --> 03:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
particularly sensitive to ensuring that
 
03:14:50.990 --> 03:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have a commission it
 
03:14:53.229 --> 03:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
should be active if it's going to be
 
03:14:55.190 --> 03:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing okay thank you represent
 
03:14:57.150 --> 03:14:57.160 align:start position:0%

03:17:22.429 --> 03:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
upfront you know we the for society we
 
03:17:25.030 --> 03:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
are not experts in the area of solid
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
waste management um but we are a land
 
03:17:32.670 --> 03:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
trust and Forestry organization so we
 
03:17:35.070 --> 03:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
protect land conserve land either by
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
owning it ourselves or holding
 
03:17:40.150 --> 03:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
conservation easements on other
 
03:17:43.590 --> 03:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
privately held land uh we also manage
 
03:17:46.189 --> 03:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
the forest resources on the on the
 
03:17:49.349 --> 03:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
properties that we we do own um but you
 
03:17:52.590 --> 03:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
know when we but I think the the value
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
that we would bring to this group is
 
03:17:56.349 --> 03:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
that you know when we are considering
 
03:17:59.189 --> 03:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not to protect a specific
 
03:18:01.269 --> 03:18:01.279 align:start position:0%
property you know we look at the whole
 
03:18:03.670 --> 03:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know what what are the important re
 
03:18:05.429 --> 03:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
natural resources there whether it's
 
03:18:08.309 --> 03:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
water Forest you know Forest
 
03:18:11.349 --> 03:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
resources you know e uh recreational
 
03:18:13.630 --> 03:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
interests cultural the so the whole
 
03:18:15.510 --> 03:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
gamut that goes into a particular
 
03:18:17.670 --> 03:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
property and so
 
03:18:21.070 --> 03:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that perspective um
 
03:18:23.349 --> 03:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
on the working group as representative
 
03:18:25.630 --> 03:18:25.640 align:start position:0%

03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
8 so today I come presenting House Bill
 
03:25:44.640 --> 03:25:46.349 align:start position:0%
8 so today I come presenting House Bill
179

03:25:46.349 --> 03:25:46.359 align:start position:0%
179
 
03:25:49.550 --> 03:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
reference to uh the fees payment of the
 
03:25:49.560 --> 03:25:50.870 align:start position:0%
reference to uh the fees payment of the
fees

03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
fees
 
03:25:55.750 --> 03:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
or for hazardous materials uh actions so
 
03:25:57.870 --> 03:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
when we have an incident we're going to
 
03:25:57.880 --> 03:25:59.349 align:start position:0%
when we have an incident we're going to
use

03:25:59.349 --> 03:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:26:02.950 --> 03:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
equipment uh to mitigate that plus a lot
 
03:26:05.550 --> 03:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
of our equipment gets contaminated or
 
03:26:10.070 --> 03:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
destroyed so there there's a RSA that
 
03:26:14.030 --> 03:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
says who's ever responsible for that
 
03:26:16.990 --> 03:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials incident
 
03:26:18.349 --> 03:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
has to
 
03:26:24.630 --> 03:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
pay so we submit a invoice to them they
 
03:26:29.389 --> 03:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
have 30 days to look at that invoice if
 
03:26:30.830 --> 03:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
they don't think it's right they can
 
03:26:33.950 --> 03:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
challenge it after the 30 days if they
 
03:26:35.429 --> 03:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
haven't challenged
 
03:26:38.189 --> 03:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
it they're responsible for
 
03:26:40.150 --> 03:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:26:44.110 --> 03:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
bill um we get challenged
 
03:26:47.189 --> 03:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
on you know
 
03:26:50.750 --> 03:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
how old was your your turnout
 
03:26:53.229 --> 03:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
gear and I'm not really sure how that
 
03:26:55.189 --> 03:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
plays because you can't go buy used
 
03:26:57.189 --> 03:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
turnout gear to replace my used turnout
 
03:27:00.349 --> 03:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
gear you have to buy me new turnout gear
 
03:27:06.189 --> 03:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
or hoses or the uh pads or whatever
 
03:27:09.269 --> 03:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
other things that we use for the
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
mitigation of that incident has to be
 
03:27:17.269 --> 03:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
replaced there's no use so um but
 
03:27:18.830 --> 03:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
it used to
 
03:27:20.790 --> 03:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
be a
 
03:27:24.469 --> 03:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
$1,000 fine if they didn't pay the
 
03:27:28.429 --> 03:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:31.710 --> 03:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
$50,000 that's a deal here's $1,000 I'm
 
03:27:36.830 --> 03:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
all set so my amendment to that RSA is
 
03:27:39.790 --> 03:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
that it should be $1,000 per day after
 
03:27:41.870 --> 03:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
the 90 days they have up to 90 days to
 
03:27:44.950 --> 03:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
come up and pay the bill after the 90
 
03:27:47.189 --> 03:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
days it should be $1,000 a day plus the
 
03:27:47.199 --> 03:27:48.790 align:start position:0%
days it should be $1,000 a day plus the
20%

03:27:48.790 --> 03:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
20%
 
03:27:51.150 --> 03:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
penalty uh until you
 
03:27:54.429 --> 03:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
reach the price of the bill with the 20%
 
03:27:59.309 --> 03:27:59.319 align:start position:0%
over that and those fines should be paid
 
03:28:00.429 --> 03:28:00.439 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:28:02.510 --> 03:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have used that
 
03:28:06.269 --> 03:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
equipment that who are not being paid
 
03:28:11.830 --> 03:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
and this is a way to finally get paid if
 
03:28:14.229 --> 03:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
these fees aren't
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
paid the has hazardous material teams
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
the fire departments have
 
03:28:25.550 --> 03:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
trouble working they they're funding and
 
03:28:28.429 --> 03:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
I have Chief deandreis with me uh who's
 
03:28:32.750 --> 03:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
the uh president of uh the seos HazMat
 
03:28:34.790 --> 03:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
team and he can giv you a more detailed
 
03:28:37.870 --> 03:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
how that works and how it is so
 
03:28:39.750 --> 03:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
important to get the money to replace
 
03:28:41.990 --> 03:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
the equipment because there's very
 
03:28:43.950 --> 03:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
little funding for HazMat teams in this
 
03:28:46.429 --> 03:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
state so if we don't get to our
 
03:28:49.429 --> 03:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
equipment we're not ready for the next
 
03:28:52.349 --> 03:28:52.359 align:start position:0%
incident and with that I'll take
 
03:28:55.189 --> 03:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um representative
 
03:28:58.150 --> 03:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
ktoa then Howard thank you madam
 
03:28:59.790 --> 03:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here
 
03:29:03.630 --> 03:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill you talked about um
 
03:29:08.950 --> 03:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:08.960 --> 03:29:13.269 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:29:13.269 --> 03:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:16.910 --> 03:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
can so
 
03:29:18.510 --> 03:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
I come the from the fire department not
 
03:29:21.309 --> 03:29:21.319 align:start position:0%
a hatmat team so the latest incident
 
03:29:23.870 --> 03:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
that I was involved in involved Oil
 
03:29:27.189 --> 03:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
Trucks I got knocked to the ground and
 
03:29:29.830 --> 03:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
got covered in oil along with my turnout
 
03:29:32.670 --> 03:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
gear once it has oil on it we can't go
 
03:29:34.469 --> 03:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
into burning buildings with it anymore
 
03:29:37.349 --> 03:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
so it is contaminated it got taken from
 
03:29:38.750 --> 03:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
me at the
 
03:29:38.760 --> 03:29:40.910 align:start position:0%
me at the
scene

03:29:40.910 --> 03:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
scene
 
03:29:47.309 --> 03:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
um so now our department has to replace
 
03:29:50.150 --> 03:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
that and to replace a set of turnout
 
03:29:53.229 --> 03:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
gear is between 7 and
 
03:29:55.309 --> 03:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
$10,000 per
 
03:29:59.389 --> 03:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:01.910 --> 03:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
Hose we have to replace
 
03:30:06.710 --> 03:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
that um the HazMat team that use uh
 
03:30:10.550 --> 03:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
booms or absorbing pads to
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
mitigate the flow of the oil all has to
 
03:30:13.680 --> 03:30:14.429 align:start position:0%
mitigate the flow of the oil all has to
be

03:30:14.429 --> 03:30:14.439 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:30:16.550 --> 03:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
replaced uh there's very very little
 
03:30:19.229 --> 03:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
funding to replace those you know they
 
03:30:21.429 --> 03:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
over time they've made a stockpile and
 
03:30:24.990 --> 03:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
if they use that stockpile then unless
 
03:30:27.389 --> 03:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
we get paid for what we use it it's hard
 
03:30:29.830 --> 03:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
to build that back up again okay
 
03:30:31.990 --> 03:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
followup representative ktoa thank you
 
03:30:34.870 --> 03:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for that um do
 
03:30:36.950 --> 03:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
you work in conjunction with Dees on
 
03:30:39.710 --> 03:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
these um accidents
 
03:30:44.150 --> 03:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
yes one more um thank you m chair uh so
 
03:30:47.070 --> 03:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
does dees also access penalties and
 
03:30:49.429 --> 03:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
fines and collect
 
03:30:51.469 --> 03:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
monies I'm not
 
03:30:53.710 --> 03:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
sure I would imagine there might be some
 
03:30:56.070 --> 03:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
fines if if wrongdoing happened
 
03:30:58.750 --> 03:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative Howard and then Miner
 
03:31:00.110 --> 03:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair hello
 
03:31:01.750 --> 03:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative nice to see you again
 
03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
nice to see you so I I is it when you
 
03:31:07.830 --> 03:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
when the when you lose equipment and it
 
03:31:10.510 --> 03:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
gets replaced the does it fine start
 
03:31:12.550 --> 03:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
with the cost of the equipment or $1,000
 
03:31:14.189 --> 03:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
because it sounded as if it's $1,000 a
 
03:31:15.710 --> 03:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
day starting at day one or is it the
 
03:31:18.229 --> 03:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
cost cost and then $1,000 after 90 days
 
03:31:22.030 --> 03:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
or 60 days so so after 90 days so
 
03:31:25.630 --> 03:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
originally the the fine was $1,000 after
 
03:31:27.389 --> 03:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
90 days if they didn't
 
03:31:30.550 --> 03:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
pay so they don't
 
03:31:35.429 --> 03:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
pay ,000 or a th000 kind of a no-brainer
 
03:31:39.750 --> 03:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
so that's why I put this in that if it
 
03:31:42.830 --> 03:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
becomes $1,000 a
 
03:31:46.870 --> 03:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
day up to 20% over what the bill is it
 
03:31:50.309 --> 03:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
gives them incentive to just pay it
 
03:31:51.950 --> 03:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
right so if we can get paid in a timely
 
03:31:55.030 --> 03:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
fashion that would be great but if it's
 
03:31:55.040 --> 03:31:56.550 align:start position:0%
fashion that would be great but if it's
just

03:31:56.550 --> 03:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:31:59.030 --> 03:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
$1,000 they're going to drag drag it out
 
03:32:01.590 --> 03:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
or not pay it all and we'll end up in
 
03:32:04.469 --> 03:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
court and you know how long that
 
03:32:07.229 --> 03:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
takes okay representative Miner and then
 
03:32:09.469 --> 03:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
um Penza and Freeman thank you
 
03:32:11.510 --> 03:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative cre um I got a question
 
03:32:13.429 --> 03:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
for you our town recently I'm going to
 
03:32:14.710 --> 03:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
say recently within the past couple of
 
03:32:17.150 --> 03:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
years what the large industrial uh
 
03:32:19.030 --> 03:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
washing machine that is supposed to
 
03:32:22.150 --> 03:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
clean and uh clean and wash out all the
 
03:32:24.110 --> 03:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
Hazardous Materials on these turnout
 
03:32:26.510 --> 03:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
gear can you speak to that so the
 
03:32:29.110 --> 03:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
extractor doesn't get all the oil out it
 
03:32:32.510 --> 03:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
gets a lot of the fire products out like
 
03:32:36.750 --> 03:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
carbon and and those things but um very
 
03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
rarely does it get all of the oil
 
03:32:42.790 --> 03:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
residue that becomes embedded from what
 
03:32:47.429 --> 03:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
I understand and uh and and I was told
 
03:32:49.790 --> 03:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
um we couldn't get our gear back CU it's
 
03:32:52.750 --> 03:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
just too contaminated to be cleaned
 
03:32:52.760 --> 03:32:53.830 align:start position:0%
just too contaminated to be cleaned
thank

03:32:53.830 --> 03:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:32:57.469 --> 03:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Penza and then
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair um just to
 
03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
kind of understand the process so for
 
03:33:05.469 --> 03:33:05.479 align:start position:0%
example let's say it's XYZ company
 
03:33:08.070 --> 03:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's a spill you know let's just use
 
03:33:10.070 --> 03:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
your example all that equipment gets
 
03:33:12.309 --> 03:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
destroyed so does the fire department
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
then uh send like the the bill the fines
 
03:33:18.510 --> 03:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
or what ever directly to XYZ company so
 
03:33:21.229 --> 03:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
we don't do fines but we will take an
 
03:33:23.630 --> 03:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
inventory of what was damaged okay we
 
03:33:25.469 --> 03:33:25.479 align:start position:0%
will look up replacement costs of that
 
03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
equipment and present them with an
 
03:33:30.870 --> 03:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
invoice within 30 days okay so the XYZ
 
03:33:33.309 --> 03:33:33.319 align:start position:0%
company gets the invoice within 30 days
 
03:33:36.269 --> 03:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
and you're saying that right now um
 
03:33:38.590 --> 03:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
there's that's not they're not paying
 
03:33:41.349 --> 03:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
correct because the the fine for not
 
03:33:43.150 --> 03:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
paying is
 
03:33:46.269 --> 03:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
$11,000 and so now this whole this and
 
03:33:48.590 --> 03:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
that's still in place or does that that
 
03:33:50.189 --> 03:33:50.199 align:start position:0%
right now is still in place until we get
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
this P correct correct thank you
 
03:33:55.870 --> 03:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman and then Bixby
 
03:33:56.990 --> 03:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:33:58.630 --> 03:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative for coming in front of us
 
03:34:02.349 --> 03:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
today um I have a question about the way
 
03:34:04.870 --> 03:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
you've structured this penalty I have a
 
03:34:06.870 --> 03:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
Tac question is that all right sure sure
 
03:34:08.750 --> 03:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much um for allowing me
 
03:34:12.110 --> 03:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
some latitude um would this also uh
 
03:34:17.710 --> 03:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:20.070 --> 03:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
say if it was my house my house is
 
03:34:22.229 --> 03:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
burning and you're exposed to something
 
03:34:24.750 --> 03:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
hazardous in my house uh totally
 
03:34:28.469 --> 03:34:28.479 align:start position:0%
different if it's in conjunction with a
 
03:34:31.750 --> 03:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
fire that something gets released yes um
 
03:34:34.189 --> 03:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
like at a private residence you had a
 
03:34:36.349 --> 03:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
can of gasoline in the in the thing on
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
my oil tank or your oil
 
03:34:43.309 --> 03:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
tank that is outside of this it doesn't
 
03:34:46.510 --> 03:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
get included in this okay okay that that
 
03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
as far the way I understand it okay
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and this is the thank you
 
03:34:53.070 --> 03:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair I appreciate that um I do
 
03:34:54.590 --> 03:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
have a question about the way the
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
penalty is structured so and and please
 
03:35:01.389 --> 03:35:01.399 align:start position:0%
forgive me I want to understand this
 
03:35:04.309 --> 03:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
100% it's to be paid to the claimant
 
03:35:07.030 --> 03:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
which would be the municipality the city
 
03:35:11.550 --> 03:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
the town correct at $1,000 per day plus
 
03:35:13.710 --> 03:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
interest assessed at the rate of
 
03:35:16.630 --> 03:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
interest established in RSA
 
03:35:20.349 --> 03:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
3361 and an additional 20% of each day's
 
03:35:24.110 --> 03:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
penalty for non-payment after 90 days of
 
03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
the initial non-payment is that not
 
03:35:28.550 --> 03:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
correct correct so what I was looking
 
03:35:31.790 --> 03:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
for and I kind of left this to the
 
03:35:33.990 --> 03:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
drafter and we all know how that goes
 
03:35:37.790 --> 03:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
which is never a good idea yeah so
 
03:35:39.910 --> 03:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh my thought
 
03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
is the fine
 
03:35:45.630 --> 03:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
starts at $1,000 a day after 90 days
 
03:35:47.590 --> 03:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
instead of just the
 
03:35:52.030 --> 03:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
$1,000 and be done so if they choose to
 
03:35:55.469 --> 03:35:55.479 align:start position:0%
pay the whole bill after three days then
 
03:35:57.550 --> 03:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
that gets absorbed and we're we're all
 
03:36:01.349 --> 03:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
so I didn't know how to
 
03:36:06.309 --> 03:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
better uh and maybe there's a better way
 
03:36:10.189 --> 03:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
to get them to come and and and pay in a
 
03:36:11.830 --> 03:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
timely fashion and that's what I'm
 
03:36:14.670 --> 03:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
trying to get right because the HazMat
 
03:36:18.790 --> 03:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
team is out out their equipment our our
 
03:36:21.110 --> 03:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
department dug
 
03:36:24.189 --> 03:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
into a pile of money that wasn't in our
 
03:36:26.389 --> 03:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
budget so we could get our turnout gear
 
03:36:30.550 --> 03:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
replaced because we wouldn't have it um
 
03:36:32.189 --> 03:36:32.199 align:start position:0%
so they're waiting to get that money
 
03:36:33.710 --> 03:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
back so they can put the money back
 
03:36:37.389 --> 03:36:37.399 align:start position:0%
where they took it from uh so I'm
 
03:36:39.870 --> 03:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
figuring if they're looking at $1,000 a
 
03:36:39.880 --> 03:36:42.590 align:start position:0%
figuring if they're looking at $1,000 a
day

03:36:42.590 --> 03:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:36:46.189 --> 03:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
until they've reached their payment
 
03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
with a 21 20% over that price however
 
03:36:53.670 --> 03:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
you figure that out it should be some
 
03:36:56.990 --> 03:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
penalty in there for making me wait for
 
03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
$50,000 another 50 days to get paid for
 
03:37:01.840 --> 03:37:02.710 align:start position:0%
$50,000 another 50 days to get paid for
our

03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:37:06.630 --> 03:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
equipment thank you representative Bixby
 
03:37:09.189 --> 03:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair I uh I also
 
03:37:11.469 --> 03:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
have a I'm a little bit confused about
 
03:37:14.469 --> 03:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
the um about the the way that the
 
03:37:16.510 --> 03:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
payment mechanism is is is laid out
 
03:37:19.189 --> 03:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
because the I'm open to suggestions I I
 
03:37:21.830 --> 03:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
just want to clar I so I I just want a b
 
03:37:24.349 --> 03:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
little bit of clarity about the goal um
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
so and I'm just going to read from look
 
03:37:30.469 --> 03:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
at the bill I submitted rather than the
 
03:37:33.710 --> 03:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
the other one um so in the bill is
 
03:37:37.189 --> 03:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
submitted um then that thousand of
 
03:37:40.269 --> 03:37:40.279 align:start position:0%
dollars a day can start starts at at 90
 
03:37:43.790 --> 03:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
days and then goes until the bill
 
03:37:46.910 --> 03:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
payment is received right
 
03:37:51.670 --> 03:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
um followup followup and uh
 
03:37:55.510 --> 03:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
so is that $1,000 a day going to be on
 
03:37:58.870 --> 03:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
top of the cost of replacing equipment
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
no okay that's why I kind of put the
 
03:38:05.349 --> 03:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
amendment in I'm trying to get the cost
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the replacement right so at a $1,000
 
03:38:12.590 --> 03:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
fine wasn't doing it so if I get to fine
 
03:38:16.710 --> 03:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
you up to the cost of the Equipment Plus
 
03:38:18.870 --> 03:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
a 20%
 
03:38:23.510 --> 03:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
penalty that's motivation to pay it okay
 
03:38:29.429 --> 03:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
so so the goal is to uh have the fines
 
03:38:32.389 --> 03:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
result in the reimbursement
 
03:38:36.469 --> 03:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursement plus a 20% penalty for
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
which will um provide an incentive to
 
03:38:43.389 --> 03:38:43.399 align:start position:0%
actually do it sooner correct okay uh I
 
03:38:44.870 --> 03:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
I think we might need to do a little bit
 
03:38:47.590 --> 03:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
of amendment but I think this is I I
 
03:38:49.590 --> 03:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
think the concept makes a lot of sense
 
03:38:53.229 --> 03:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative Scully
 
03:38:54.990 --> 03:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
being here and taking the questions um
 
03:39:00.550 --> 03:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
what I don't see here is any
 
03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
proportionality so if you send a bill
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
for $100,000 to one person and you send
 
03:39:08.189 --> 03:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
$5,000 to another person you if that
 
03:39:10.710 --> 03:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
person doesn't pay the $5,000 fine he's
 
03:39:12.630 --> 03:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
going to be hit with $1,000 a day with
 
03:39:12.640 --> 03:39:14.349 align:start position:0%
going to be hit with $1,000 a day with
no

03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:39:16.630 --> 03:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
endpoint no there's an end point when
 
03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
when you reach whatever the bill is it
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
stops I don't think I told the drafter
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
to put that in and maybe I need to get
 
03:39:27.070 --> 03:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
it drafted again but once you
 
03:39:31.229 --> 03:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
reach the amount of the bill the fine
 
03:39:34.870 --> 03:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
stops and then 20% right so there's 20%
 
03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
along with that so if it was
 
03:39:41.590 --> 03:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
$100,000 120
 
03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
right okay yeah I I just didn't see that
 
03:39:45.750 --> 03:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
language in here right now so you're
 
03:39:49.110 --> 03:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
intending to amend this to yep okay
 
03:39:49.120 --> 03:39:50.750 align:start position:0%
intending to amend this to yep okay
thank

03:39:50.750 --> 03:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:39:56.030 --> 03:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
K thank you madam chair I was just
 
03:39:59.590 --> 03:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
looking over the RSA and um one of the
 
03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
representatives brought up about uh a
 
03:40:04.670 --> 03:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
fire at their home and the part that
 
03:40:06.750 --> 03:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
struck me and and maybe you can help me
 
03:40:08.349 --> 03:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
here it says
 
03:40:11.630 --> 03:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
here the response to fires or other
 
03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
emergencies where the discharge of haard
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
materials is incidental to the fire
 
03:40:19.670 --> 03:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
or other emergency and does not require
 
03:40:20.910 --> 03:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
the use of
 
03:40:24.309 --> 03:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
specialized ha materials shall not be
 
03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
cost eligible but if there is use they
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
would still be eligible to for the cost
 
03:40:36.550 --> 03:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
AC the way I'm I'm just asking because
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
further up it talks about whether by
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable or even a mission that you
 
03:40:47.870 --> 03:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
didn't know um your responsib for this
 
03:40:51.550 --> 03:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm just a little concerned that
 
03:40:53.670 --> 03:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
somebody may have something hazardous
 
03:40:55.750 --> 03:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
where you have to call in
 
03:40:59.189 --> 03:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
Hazmat that the homeowner or somebody
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
that has no idea that they would need a
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
Hazmat person in there and how that
 
03:41:06.550 --> 03:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
would affect them I'm going to tell you
 
03:41:09.790 --> 03:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
from experience that if it's such a
 
03:41:13.389 --> 03:41:13.399 align:start position:0%
small item that the person who has it
 
03:41:14.830 --> 03:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't know that they're going to need
 
03:41:18.269 --> 03:41:18.279 align:start position:0%
a haard mat team they probably
 
03:41:23.429 --> 03:41:23.439 align:start position:0%
won't right but if you have a a a 5,000
 
03:41:26.590 --> 03:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
gallon tank of oil sitting in your
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
backyard and it you haven't maintained
 
03:41:34.189 --> 03:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
it and it let's go then you're going to
 
03:41:38.429 --> 03:41:38.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:42.790 --> 03:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
company you're okay representative Penza
 
03:41:44.710 --> 03:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
did you have a question yes sorry thank
 
03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
03:41:49.550 --> 03:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
do you think it makes sense to
 
03:41:52.510 --> 03:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
um just because there is a little bit of
 
03:41:54.790 --> 03:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
ambiguity from what representative ktoa
 
03:41:57.950 --> 03:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
just said in that that we should um
 
03:42:01.269 --> 03:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
maybe further explain that in your bill
 
03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
I just of course if someone has
 
03:42:06.229 --> 03:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials on their property
 
03:42:08.750 --> 03:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
that are not allowed by law that it
 
03:42:09.910 --> 03:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense that they would be
 
03:42:11.950 --> 03:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for that I get that but it
 
03:42:14.309 --> 03:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
just I don't know I I don't want to open
 
03:42:18.710 --> 03:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
us open it up for um you know a a
 
03:42:20.950 --> 03:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
private you know private Citizen
 
03:42:24.110 --> 03:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
Homeowner something like that um to get
 
03:42:27.750 --> 03:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
hurt with this when you know is there do
 
03:42:29.189 --> 03:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
you think that there's a pathway that we
 
03:42:33.510 --> 03:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
RSA we would build them anyway so right
 
03:42:42.110 --> 03:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
if if they fell into the realm and I
 
03:42:43.870 --> 03:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
know the person behind me has better
 
03:42:45.670 --> 03:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
answers than I do
 
03:42:48.750 --> 03:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh fell into the realm of that it was a
 
03:42:48.760 --> 03:42:50.790 align:start position:0%
uh fell into the realm of that it was a
Hazmat

03:42:50.790 --> 03:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
Hazmat
 
03:42:53.110 --> 03:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
incident they're going to get an
 
03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
invoice for the equipment no matter what
 
03:43:03.349 --> 03:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
right and they were going to get find
 
03:43:05.830 --> 03:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
$1,000 right if if their insurance
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
company didn't pay and that's who
 
03:43:10.870 --> 03:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
becomes responsible is the insurance
 
03:43:13.269 --> 03:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
company insurance company
 
03:43:15.710 --> 03:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you
 
03:43:17.990 --> 03:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you um was there a
 
03:43:19.870 --> 03:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
particular incident or something that
 
03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
happened which triggered this uh this
 
03:43:25.030 --> 03:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
legislation to be submitted by you and
 
03:43:27.269 --> 03:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I can't talk about that
 
03:43:29.389 --> 03:43:29.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry and unfortunately I can't talk
 
03:43:31.110 --> 03:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
about that because it's being litigated
 
03:43:35.429 --> 03:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
as we speak ah okay thank you for that
 
03:43:38.469 --> 03:43:38.479 align:start position:0%
huh unfortunately
 
03:43:41.630 --> 03:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
yeah all right uh any other questions
 
03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:43:45.990 --> 03:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
committee okay seeing n thank you very
 
03:43:48.670 --> 03:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
much for uh introducing this bill and I
 
03:43:51.269 --> 03:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
call now uh Donald
 
03:44:01.510 --> 03:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:04.510 --> 03:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
team it's on no you just turned it on
 
03:44:05.469 --> 03:44:05.479 align:start position:0%
there you
 
03:44:08.110 --> 03:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
go I am the the chair please state your
 
03:44:09.750 --> 03:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
name and where you from thank you I'm
 
03:44:11.990 --> 03:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
Don d'angeles I'm the eping fire
 
03:44:15.149 --> 03:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
chief and I am the chair of the Hazmat
 
03:44:17.750 --> 03:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
team on the Sea Coast region and there's
 
03:44:20.790 --> 03:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
eight teams in the state all of them are
 
03:44:23.229 --> 03:44:23.239 align:start position:0%
locally funded we and we survive off
 
03:44:26.149 --> 03:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
grants and local funding so each town
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
that is a member of the team uh they
 
03:44:30.750 --> 03:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
contribute their portion generally our
 
03:44:34.429 --> 03:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
budgets 151,000 a year most of that's
 
03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
consumed by training and uh anything
 
03:44:39.750 --> 03:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
else that we use for equipment stuff as
 
03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
Mark said if there's a spill uh the
 
03:44:45.389 --> 03:44:45.399 align:start position:0%
insurance companies generally uh repair
 
03:44:48.070 --> 03:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
replace uh all of the damaged and
 
03:44:50.469 --> 03:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
degradated equipment so we rely heavily
 
03:44:53.990 --> 03:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
on billing uh you asked Mark what
 
03:44:55.710 --> 03:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
incident prompt this and I I know the
 
03:44:57.429 --> 03:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
incident he's talking about and it was
 
03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
significant uh I was there as well and
 
03:45:01.950 --> 03:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
Five Towns lost a lot of their
 
03:45:04.830 --> 03:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
structural firefighting gear and the
 
03:45:07.790 --> 03:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier hasn't paid and as a
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
result I know that we we got hit we're
 
03:45:12.429 --> 03:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
fortunate that would happened at the end
 
03:45:14.950 --> 03:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
of our budgeting process so we could get
 
03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
$50,000 from the town to replace it the
 
03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
other four towns didn't get that and
 
03:45:21.590 --> 03:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
they went without for almost an entire
 
03:45:23.469 --> 03:45:23.479 align:start position:0%
year in fact it was an entire year they
 
03:45:25.149 --> 03:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
went out with went out with equipment
 
03:45:27.229 --> 03:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
they couldn't function anymore because
 
03:45:28.870 --> 03:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
their budgets were done and they
 
03:45:31.550 --> 03:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't get it replaced uh that's not
 
03:45:33.910 --> 03:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
the only incident we've had my team
 
03:45:35.790 --> 03:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
especially hasn't been paid for there's
 
03:45:38.710 --> 03:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
been other incidents one incident almost
 
03:45:40.349 --> 03:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
put us out of business because we never
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
got compensated for all of our loss and
 
03:45:45.870 --> 03:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
the towns ate it there's another
 
03:45:47.469 --> 03:45:47.479 align:start position:0%
incident we didn't get paid for and one
 
03:45:49.710 --> 03:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
of the questions was what if it happens
 
03:45:51.189 --> 03:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
at a home and we did have a home and
 
03:45:52.830 --> 03:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
generally homeowners insurance covers
 
03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
that uh but we had a renter no renters
 
03:45:58.189 --> 03:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
insurance and we had to eat that and
 
03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
that person fled the country so we're
 
03:46:01.030 --> 03:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
never going to get that money and we had
 
03:46:02.550 --> 03:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
to eat that as
 
03:46:05.870 --> 03:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
well we we operate a team that goes from
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
Farmington all the way down to plastow
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
from Deerfield all the way over to
 
03:46:12.790 --> 03:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth one of the larger
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
teams and the issue of not being paid
 
03:46:17.590 --> 03:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
wounds us to the point that we can't
 
03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
function anymore so we'll go without
 
03:46:23.429 --> 03:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
until we do get paid or another bud
 
03:46:25.750 --> 03:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
budget cycle comes along we often can
 
03:46:27.750 --> 03:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
share stuff when we're in a jam with
 
03:46:31.229 --> 03:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
other teams they can bail us out uh
 
03:46:32.910 --> 03:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
that's generally how we survive by
 
03:46:34.950 --> 03:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
begging and borrowing at
 
03:46:38.469 --> 03:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
times generally we our most of our work
 
03:46:40.349 --> 03:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
is uh fixed
 
03:46:43.830 --> 03:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
facilities industrial and transportation
 
03:46:47.550 --> 03:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
accidents the teams about 30 people each
 
03:46:50.149 --> 03:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
Town contributes some help to it and
 
03:46:51.630 --> 03:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
these team these teams are all trained
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
in as hattis materials
 
03:46:56.510 --> 03:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
technicians the funding is tight it's
 
03:46:58.750 --> 03:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
already on a shoestring we don't receive
 
03:47:00.990 --> 03:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
any help from funding from the state
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
other than grants that are available and
 
03:47:09.189 --> 03:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
we really our life blood is getting
 
03:47:12.070 --> 03:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
reburst for our for our losses in any
 
03:47:15.590 --> 03:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
damaged equipment
 
03:47:18.149 --> 03:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
that's my that's my concern three times
 
03:47:20.429 --> 03:47:20.439 align:start position:0%
now we haven't been paid and it's
 
03:47:22.990 --> 03:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
injured the team's ability to respond as
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
a result of all that lost
 
03:47:28.269 --> 03:47:28.279 align:start position:0%
equipment are these insurance companies
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
that are not paying you or is it um
 
03:47:35.030 --> 03:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
individual the companies I I don't know
 
03:47:36.590 --> 03:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
who is it that who is it that's supposed
 
03:47:38.910 --> 03:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
to be paying most of our work is
 
03:47:38.920 --> 03:47:39.830 align:start position:0%
to be paying most of our work is
insurance

03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
companies okay there are times we we
 
03:47:44.630 --> 03:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
have had to take the loss because there
 
03:47:47.349 --> 03:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:50.870 --> 03:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
Insurance okay um representative guber
 
03:47:51.910 --> 03:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:47:54.630 --> 03:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
Penza uh thank you I used to oversee a
 
03:47:57.870 --> 03:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
hazard material Department in Vermont I
 
03:48:00.510 --> 03:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
understand your concerns the um the
 
03:48:02.590 --> 03:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
insurance companies themselves which are
 
03:48:04.189 --> 03:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
typically the places where you get
 
03:48:06.469 --> 03:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursed is there another technique
 
03:48:08.389 --> 03:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
that you could uh that could be done at
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
the state level with the insurance
 
03:48:12.189 --> 03:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
commission for the insurance companies
 
03:48:14.070 --> 03:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
to be forced them to pay these sort of
 
03:48:16.149 --> 03:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
payments you I think I'll I'll wait for
 
03:48:17.710 --> 03:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
the Portsmith Chief to answer that
 
03:48:19.670 --> 03:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
question for you because he actually is
 
03:48:21.790 --> 03:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
the president of the mutual Aid System I
 
03:48:24.590 --> 03:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
work for him so he he deals with those
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
issues I think he'd probably answer the
 
03:48:27.710 --> 03:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
question more appropriately is that fair
 
03:48:29.510 --> 03:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thanks oh there's someone
 
03:48:30.790 --> 03:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
else who's going to be speaking because
 
03:48:33.269 --> 03:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
I don't have any more pink cards oh okay
 
03:48:36.269 --> 03:48:36.279 align:start position:0%
just pass it around thank you uh
 
03:48:38.830 --> 03:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
represent Penza yeah this might be a
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
question for the next speaker but um
 
03:48:43.110 --> 03:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
just quickly it goes back to uh earlier
 
03:48:46.149 --> 03:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
in your testimony um in regards with the
 
03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
insurance piece so I just wanted to
 
03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
understand that so you're saying that um
 
03:48:54.590 --> 03:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
you guys are out uh fighting any of
 
03:48:57.710 --> 03:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
these situations equipment gets damage
 
03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
the insurance for these are you know
 
03:49:02.550 --> 03:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be private entities or
 
03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
whatever that are supposed to cover it
 
03:49:07.110 --> 03:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
just don't end up paying most of the
 
03:49:10.590 --> 03:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:12.469 --> 03:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
don't that's what we're going through
 
03:49:13.990 --> 03:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
right now actually one we have a
 
03:49:16.630 --> 03:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
significant bill Bill very significant
 
03:49:18.670 --> 03:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
Bill and we've not received payment yet
 
03:49:23.550 --> 03:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
followup I understand that this bill
 
03:49:28.149 --> 03:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
will put you know emphasis because it's
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
higher penalties and stuff like that and
 
03:49:31.590 --> 03:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
especially if it's going to let's say a
 
03:49:34.429 --> 03:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
court case but this isn't necessarily
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
going to if someone's if someone's not
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
paying they're still not going to pay
 
03:49:40.030 --> 03:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
like it it's obviously going to take
 
03:49:41.469 --> 03:49:41.479 align:start position:0%
probably a matter of court to make them
 
03:49:44.790 --> 03:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
do that correct
 
03:49:47.309 --> 03:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
they generally pay uh this is to uh
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
entice them to pay sooner so we can be
 
03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
made whole so we can get back up and
 
03:49:50.760 --> 03:49:51.830 align:start position:0%
made whole so we can get back up and
functioning

03:49:51.830 --> 03:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
functioning

existing law to to make it a little
 
03:50:59.910 --> 03:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:02.389 --> 03:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
folks okay any questions from the
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
committee representative Freeman thank
 
03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for coming
 
03:51:09.070 --> 03:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
in front of us I'm just curious what for
 
03:51:11.030 --> 03:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
some of the conversation and some of the
 
03:51:13.590 --> 03:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
testimony you've been live listening to
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
um there seem seems to be some issue
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
with insurance companies reimbursing you
 
03:51:21.429 --> 03:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
in a timely fashion is that correct uh
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and yes
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the the Crux of the
 
03:51:26.269 --> 03:51:26.279 align:start position:0%
issue is carriers and ultimately who's
 
03:51:28.110 --> 03:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
responsible thank you I may have a
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
followup absolutely thank you so much so
 
03:51:32.750 --> 03:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
um given given this change in the law
 
03:51:34.269 --> 03:51:34.279 align:start position:0%
how do you feel this would compel
 
03:51:36.670 --> 03:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to pay
 
03:51:40.030 --> 03:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
up uh again we we think that if there's
 
03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
more of a uh more teeth there and that
 
03:51:44.229 --> 03:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be paying out as
 
03:51:46.510 --> 03:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
much money they'll be compelled to pay
 
03:51:48.710 --> 03:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
quicker right that is that is the goal
 
03:51:50.429 --> 03:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
here is to get them to pay quicker thank
 
03:51:53.070 --> 03:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Miner thank you
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for testifying
 
03:51:57.830 --> 03:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
before us today so my question is if if
 
03:51:59.309 --> 03:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
um an insurance company is not paying
 
03:52:00.590 --> 03:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
there must be a reason why they're not
 
03:52:02.229 --> 03:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
paying so apparently there's some
 
03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
dispute as to the amount or or whether
 
03:52:07.510 --> 03:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
in fact um theault lies on that
 
03:52:09.030 --> 03:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
insurance company let's say can you
 
03:52:11.189 --> 03:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
address uh address that
 
03:52:13.790 --> 03:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
issue so thanks for the question and I
 
03:52:15.670 --> 03:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's a case-by casee issue
 
03:52:17.910 --> 03:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
right with respect to whether or not
 
03:52:19.870 --> 03:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
carriers pay or when they don't pay or
 
03:52:21.389 --> 03:52:21.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a responsible
 
03:52:24.670 --> 03:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
party for the release of the uh the the
 
03:52:27.790 --> 03:52:27.800 align:start position:0%
material right so as uh as Chief
 
03:52:29.469 --> 03:52:29.479 align:start position:0%
d'angeles explained there's been some
 
03:52:31.990 --> 03:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
other circumstances that have have been
 
03:52:35.229 --> 03:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
you know um encountered right so I can't
 
03:52:37.189 --> 03:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily speak and say that it's a
 
03:52:38.870 --> 03:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's all Financial or that it's all
 
03:52:41.229 --> 03:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
insurance companies but you will agree
 
03:52:43.269 --> 03:52:43.279 align:start position:0%
there's a dispute that's that's why the
 
03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
insurance companies AR paying absolutely
 
03:52:47.990 --> 03:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
there is a dispute yes one more question
 
03:52:49.349 --> 03:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
one more question and is there an
 
03:52:51.590 --> 03:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to um negotiate this
 
03:52:53.750 --> 03:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
payment I mean is it is it all or
 
03:52:57.030 --> 03:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
nothing is that is that how it works so
 
03:52:59.229 --> 03:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
um again I don't uh I don't want to talk
 
03:53:00.990 --> 03:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
specifics about anything that's going on
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
but I think um right like anything else
 
03:53:04.990 --> 03:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
in this world right there's always room
 
03:53:06.910 --> 03:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
to negotiate and talk and come to a a
 
03:53:09.309 --> 03:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you yep representative
 
03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
pateni you had your hand
 
03:53:15.030 --> 03:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
up thank you madam chair Okay so earlier
 
03:53:17.269 --> 03:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
the I think in the first testimony I
 
03:53:20.229 --> 03:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
think the thing that was the worst part
 
03:53:23.269 --> 03:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
of what the loophole needs to be fixed
 
03:53:24.910 --> 03:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
but does this necessarily fix the
 
03:53:27.110 --> 03:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
loophole where so for example somebody
 
03:53:27.120 --> 03:53:28.189 align:start position:0%
loophole where so for example somebody
owes

03:53:28.189 --> 03:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
owes
 
03:53:30.070 --> 03:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
$50,000 they don't they're not paying
 
03:53:32.990 --> 03:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
the $50,000 you know past 90 days
 
03:53:35.830 --> 03:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be they pay the $1,000
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
and then they're off the hook for the
 
03:53:40.469 --> 03:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
50,000 is that really fixing this I I
 
03:53:42.670 --> 03:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if I see the connection
 
03:53:46.670 --> 03:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:50.189 --> 03:53:50.199 align:start position:0%
so to I'm I'm not sure in your example
 
03:53:52.149 --> 03:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
that that fixes the issue either right
 
03:53:54.389 --> 03:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe I don't I don't
 
03:53:56.750 --> 03:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
believe that's necessarily the case
 
03:53:59.389 --> 03:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
right that you'd pay $1,000 fine over
 
03:54:02.990 --> 03:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
$50,000 bill in your incident
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
right and that the way current law reads
 
03:54:08.670 --> 03:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
it would be a $551,000 bill yeah right
 
03:54:10.189 --> 03:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
okay all right I just want to make sure
 
03:54:11.830 --> 03:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
no I'm hoping I'm answering your
 
03:54:14.550 --> 03:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
question clarify just because it's
 
03:54:16.149 --> 03:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
giving them I guess in a sense the
 
03:54:18.070 --> 03:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative was talking about it
 
03:54:19.830 --> 03:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
seems like it was giving them kind of an
 
03:54:22.110 --> 03:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
out like they're they'll pay the, but
 
03:54:25.030 --> 03:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
they still haven't paid the 50 so what
 
03:54:26.750 --> 03:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
what are we gonna what can we do in a
 
03:54:28.590 --> 03:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
sense to legislate for them to actually
 
03:54:30.750 --> 03:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
pay the bill is is really what it comes
 
03:54:33.550 --> 03:54:33.560 align:start position:0%
down to and would should we specifically
 
03:54:35.070 --> 03:54:35.080 align:start position:0%
have something in here that's talking
 
03:54:37.149 --> 03:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
about an outside Insurance Agency as
 
03:54:39.550 --> 03:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
well instead of just general should we
 
03:54:42.189 --> 03:54:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
specific again uh happy to happy to work
 
03:54:47.189 --> 03:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
with the committee if uh right we we we
 
03:54:50.149 --> 03:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
certainly are are willing to come up
 
03:54:52.469 --> 03:54:52.479 align:start position:0%
with any kind of a solution
 
03:54:55.630 --> 03:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
right good representative Scully thank
 
03:54:58.510 --> 03:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
you Madame chair thanks for giving us
 
03:54:58.520 --> 03:54:59.830 align:start position:0%
you Madame chair thanks for giving us
your

03:54:59.830 --> 03:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:55:03.030 --> 03:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
testimony do you know how many times a a
 
03:55:06.510 --> 03:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
bill is sent to private homeowners after
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
a response and do you think this is is
 
03:55:12.510 --> 03:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate to hit a private homeowner
 
03:55:15.630 --> 03:55:15.640 align:start position:0%
with a hammer this big
 
03:55:17.590 --> 03:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
so with respect to sending a bill to a
 
03:55:21.110 --> 03:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
private homeowner I can tell you that um
 
03:55:25.910 --> 03:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
I don't recall um ever having done it in
 
03:55:28.790 --> 03:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
in my career all right in the last 35
 
03:55:30.030 --> 03:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
years that I've been in the involved in
 
03:55:33.790 --> 03:55:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.030 --> 03:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
service follow up would you have any
 
03:55:38.149 --> 03:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
objection and if we had some
 
03:55:40.510 --> 03:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
exclusionary language in here to say
 
03:55:42.550 --> 03:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
that homeowners would not be levied this
 
03:55:44.910 --> 03:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
type of penalty
 
03:55:47.269 --> 03:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
so I think it warrants discussion um in
 
03:55:49.269 --> 03:55:49.279 align:start position:0%
that right if you're you're a homeowner
 
03:55:50.590 --> 03:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
and you're storing something that's
 
03:55:53.670 --> 03:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
covered by this law um I don't I don't
 
03:55:56.309 --> 03:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
and and a fire department and a HazMat
 
03:55:58.510 --> 03:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
team then has to do some type of
 
03:56:01.469 --> 03:56:01.479 align:start position:0%
mitigation and cleanup right that uh
 
03:56:03.030 --> 03:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
there has to be some responsibility of
 
03:56:05.349 --> 03:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
the homeowner who brought these products
 
03:56:08.910 --> 03:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
and then had them released somehow
 
03:56:12.550 --> 03:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
right okay um well yes and and I do
 
03:56:14.349 --> 03:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
understand you could build them for that
 
03:56:16.269 --> 03:56:16.279 align:start position:0%
is this a private homeowner still this
 
03:56:19.110 --> 03:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
is would be a very honorous penalty for
 
03:56:21.110 --> 03:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
a private homeowner as opposed to a
 
03:56:23.349 --> 03:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
business that should know better and
 
03:56:27.229 --> 03:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:27.239 --> 03:56:29.110 align:start position:0%
 
practices

03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
practices
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh yeah most again homeowners homeowners
 
03:56:35.229 --> 03:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
insurance um is typically who'd be
 
03:56:37.149 --> 03:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
responsible here I think when when we're
 
03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
talking uh I think some there are some
 
03:56:43.229 --> 03:56:43.239 align:start position:0%
funds I know that are uh out there um uh
 
03:56:45.550 --> 03:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
for for you know specifically around oil
 
03:56:47.269 --> 03:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
tanks lit leaking basements and that
 
03:56:49.070 --> 03:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
type of
 
03:56:49.080 --> 03:56:50.590 align:start position:0%
type of
thing

03:56:50.590 --> 03:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:56:54.070 --> 03:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative BBY so I I want to
 
03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
get a a better sense of how the penalty
 
03:56:59.990 --> 03:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
works now and how or or fails to work
 
03:57:04.429 --> 03:57:04.439 align:start position:0%
now and how it would uh how you would
 
03:57:08.469 --> 03:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
Envision it working and um so the way it
 
03:57:11.950 --> 03:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
works as I understand it now uh there is
 
03:57:15.510 --> 03:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
a penalty of $1,000 if someone does not
 
03:57:16.910 --> 03:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
pay the bill
 
03:57:21.389 --> 03:57:21.399 align:start position:0%
promptly and then they are no longer on
 
03:57:24.870 --> 03:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
the hook for any further penalty and
 
03:57:27.469 --> 03:57:27.479 align:start position:0%
whether you can get the $50,000 that is
 
03:57:32.750 --> 03:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
actually owed is uh is a is is an open
 
03:57:34.510 --> 03:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
question so you might end up only
 
03:57:37.510 --> 03:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
getting $1,000 of penalty and no none of
 
03:57:40.710 --> 03:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
the reimbursment for the 50,000 is that
 
03:57:43.070 --> 03:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
is that the way it sometimes works in a
 
03:57:45.550 --> 03:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
worst case
 
03:57:48.070 --> 03:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
no I think the again the incentive here
 
03:57:49.469 --> 03:57:49.479 align:start position:0%
the the intent not to speak for
 
03:57:52.149 --> 03:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative cre but uh certainly our
 
03:57:54.309 --> 03:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
intent was to try and get people to pay
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
the pay the bill quicker okay so so uh
 
03:58:00.349 --> 03:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
and but I'm just talking about you know
 
03:58:02.309 --> 03:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
how it's so that was my example of how
 
03:58:04.229 --> 03:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
it fails under current law as opposed to
 
03:58:08.149 --> 03:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
what the proposal is uh so it sounds
 
03:58:11.590 --> 03:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
like the proposal is
 
03:58:16.070 --> 03:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
to have 90 days of Le way and then have
 
03:58:19.870 --> 03:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
$1,000 charged per of penalty per day
 
03:58:21.750 --> 03:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
but that penalty would effectively be
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
paying off the uh that $50,000 bill so
 
03:58:31.030 --> 03:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
after 50 days if they actually were
 
03:58:34.630 --> 03:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
paying it then they'd be free and clear
 
03:58:37.269 --> 03:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
or may or I guess there's a 20% pen
 
03:58:41.349 --> 03:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
penalty on top of that so they'd be uh
 
03:58:45.149 --> 03:58:45.159 align:start position:0%
free and clear after paying
 
03:58:50.429 --> 03:58:50.439 align:start position:0%
um 50,000 plus 20% of that uh but it
 
03:58:53.469 --> 03:58:53.479 align:start position:0%
would it would essentially put them on a
 
03:58:57.110 --> 03:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
u payment schedule of $1,000 per day is
 
03:58:59.710 --> 03:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
that what is that's what is intended and
 
03:59:01.349 --> 03:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
is that do you think that would
 
03:59:04.990 --> 03:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
work so to to speak to intent again I
 
03:59:06.469 --> 03:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
think the intent here is to get people
 
03:59:08.189 --> 03:59:08.199 align:start position:0%
to pay quicker right it's not
 
03:59:10.750 --> 03:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily get them on a payment plan
 
03:59:12.750 --> 03:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
um and as to whether or not it would
 
03:59:17.830 --> 03:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
work um I I don't know okay I I I I
 
03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm what I see here is a real
 
03:59:24.030 --> 03:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
problem and I'm not sure that the
 
03:59:27.429 --> 03:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
solution is the way that it's the
 
03:59:29.389 --> 03:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
solution that's proposed is actually
 
03:59:32.389 --> 03:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
going to get to the goal of making the
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
payments come through quicker and making
 
03:59:37.710 --> 03:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
sure they come through and I'm wondering
 
03:59:39.630 --> 03:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
if there might be some other models out
 
03:59:42.750 --> 03:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
there for uh penalties for non-payment
 
03:59:44.389 --> 03:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
that might in fact provide provide a
 
03:59:47.149 --> 03:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
better model again happy happy to work
 
03:59:49.030 --> 03:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
with the the committee right work
 
03:59:51.030 --> 03:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
session whatever you you require to to
 
03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
to get to a solution that's uh um you
 
03:59:56.189 --> 03:59:56.199 align:start position:0%
know acceptable to you thank you thank
 
03:59:58.149 --> 03:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
you yeah representative
 
04:00:00.469 --> 04:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:00:04.030 --> 04:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I keep looking at
 
04:00:07.389 --> 04:00:07.399 align:start position:0%
this and I'm looking at the
 
04:00:10.110 --> 04:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
RSA and I'm looking at the line H that
 
04:00:14.750 --> 04:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to replace and what nowhere
 
04:00:17.670 --> 04:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
on that line does it say for repayment
 
04:00:20.750 --> 04:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
it says that currently it's a one-time
 
04:00:24.550 --> 04:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:27.429 --> 04:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
acre may be assessed for
 
04:00:30.149 --> 04:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
non-payment so what you're saying this
 
04:00:34.389 --> 04:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
bill the way it's written is $11,000 per
 
04:00:36.510 --> 04:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
day plus
 
04:00:40.510 --> 04:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
interest maybe assessed after 90 days of
 
04:00:42.670 --> 04:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
non-payment it doesn't have anything
 
04:00:46.030 --> 04:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
about paying a bill this is just for non
 
04:00:51.030 --> 04:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
not even paying so my question to you is
 
04:00:53.950 --> 04:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
if this is to pay a bill why we be
 
04:00:56.590 --> 04:00:56.600 align:start position:0%
having these fines because your your
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
your intent is for them to pay the bill
 
04:01:02.670 --> 04:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
but having it as making a fine above the
 
04:01:09.950 --> 04:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:13.469 --> 04:01:13.479 align:start position:0%
asking okay so I just so they still have
 
04:01:15.269 --> 04:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
$50,000 and then they have to pay $1,000
 
04:01:18.560 --> 04:01:19.309 align:start position:0%
$50,000 and then they have to pay $1,000
per

04:01:19.309 --> 04:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
per
 
04:01:22.269 --> 04:01:22.279 align:start position:0%
day after 90
 
04:01:26.149 --> 04:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
days and they keep until they pay the
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
50,000 and then and whatever the th000 a
 
04:01:30.910 --> 04:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
day is so if they didn't pay for 50 days
 
04:01:31.790 --> 04:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
they owe you
 
04:01:35.790 --> 04:01:35.800 align:start position:0%
$100,000 plus 20% Which be $10,000 so on
 
04:01:37.990 --> 04:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
a $50,000 Bill they're going to have to
 
04:01:40.750 --> 04:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
pay you 110,000 is that my
 
04:01:44.590 --> 04:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
understanding okay
 
04:01:47.149 --> 04:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
04:01:49.429 --> 04:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
committee huh oh I'm sorry
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler I thought you
 
04:01:54.030 --> 04:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
were pointing s oh yeah sorry about that
 
04:01:56.950 --> 04:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
my angled hand I apologize Madam chair
 
04:01:59.070 --> 04:01:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my
 
04:02:02.750 --> 04:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
question um my question is if somebody
 
04:02:05.910 --> 04:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
was harboring or hosting or holding
 
04:02:08.149 --> 04:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
something in their house that was
 
04:02:11.710 --> 04:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
significant enough to represent a hazard
 
04:02:14.590 --> 04:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
danger don't you think that that is
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
extraordinary enough in itself to cause
 
04:02:19.349 --> 04:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility could you elaborate on
 
04:02:22.910 --> 04:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
what things might cause within a private
 
04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
home a hazard danger and and the what
 
04:02:28.110 --> 04:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
that represents for the officers going
 
04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
to that house thank you for the question
 
04:02:33.030 --> 04:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
represent I think the the the that's the
 
04:02:35.710 --> 04:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
issue is that uh uh we really have no
 
04:02:37.030 --> 04:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
idea what people are doing in their
 
04:02:40.229 --> 04:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
homes uh right and that uh often times
 
04:02:42.030 --> 04:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
by the time that we get called we we we
 
04:02:44.030 --> 04:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
encounter things that are are quite
 
04:02:47.950 --> 04:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
expected um certainly um our HazMat team
 
04:02:49.990 --> 04:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
has has gone to things where uh you know
 
04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
folks have been um mixing chemicals you
 
04:02:55.870 --> 04:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
know uh experimenting right that then
 
04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
caused a a serious danger to our folks
 
04:03:00.750 --> 04:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
and to themselves and to the uh the area
 
04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
around them right whether it's uh could
 
04:03:04.590 --> 04:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
even be explosives it could be right
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
chemicals right whatever it is we get
 
04:03:09.630 --> 04:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
called to try and mitigate it and and
 
04:03:12.149 --> 04:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
and to to to make it less hazardous to
 
04:03:14.429 --> 04:03:14.439 align:start position:0%
the environment so I think to your point
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative right we don't know
 
04:03:18.110 --> 04:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
what people are doing uh in in their own
 
04:03:21.790 --> 04:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
homes and uh if somebody has called us
 
04:03:23.790 --> 04:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
and it's serious enough for for us to
 
04:03:26.550 --> 04:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
take action I think it warrants some uh
 
04:03:27.389 --> 04:03:27.399 align:start position:0%
uh some
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
fine okay any other type of behavior any
 
04:03:32.990 --> 04:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
other representative Bixby yeah I'm just
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
just on that topic of you don't NE
 
04:03:38.429 --> 04:03:38.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily know what's there so that
 
04:03:40.670 --> 04:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
might be a reason not to create an
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
exemption and on one thing that comes to
 
04:03:44.510 --> 04:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
mind is that you might not know was
 
04:03:48.030 --> 04:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
there was say um an illicit meth lab and
 
04:03:49.710 --> 04:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't want to create an exemption
 
04:03:51.389 --> 04:03:51.399 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:03:53.990 --> 04:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
right okay thank
 
04:04:00.790 --> 04:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:04.790 --> 04:04:04.800 align:start position:0%

04:06:16.030 --> 04:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:06:18.229 --> 04:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
testimony Madam chair and honorable
 
04:06:20.189 --> 04:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues last year this committee
 
04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
passed a moratorium on new landfills and
 
04:06:25.030 --> 04:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
put it on the consent calendar and it is
 
04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
still a good idea in November of last
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
year JL car issued a preliminary
 
04:06:32.550 --> 04:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
objection to the new landfill sighting
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
rules sighting concerned concerns that
 
04:06:38.070 --> 04:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules were inadequate in
 
04:06:40.030 --> 04:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
key respects and would leave New
 
04:06:41.830 --> 04:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire significantly behind other
 
04:06:44.189 --> 04:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
states in the region and across the
 
04:06:46.189 --> 04:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
country and around the world in the
 
04:06:48.950 --> 04:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
protections they offer granted Staters
 
04:06:50.189 --> 04:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
in December the Department of
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services returned to JL
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
car to represent the rules
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
unchanged our colleagues on that
 
04:06:59.070 --> 04:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
committee reiterated their concerns but
 
04:07:00.990 --> 04:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
felt strongly that there was no further
 
04:07:03.510 --> 04:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
ground for Action from a rules committee
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
instead they urged the legislature to
 
04:07:08.309 --> 04:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
address these concerns through policy
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
action this moratorium will give us the
 
04:07:14.189 --> 04:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
time to do exactly that
 
04:07:16.389 --> 04:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
the primary concern raised by opponents
 
04:07:19.990 --> 04:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
of HB 171 is the assertion that a
 
04:07:22.630 --> 04:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
moratorium could result in a capacity
 
04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
shortfall this is not the case such
 
04:07:27.870 --> 04:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
concerns are based on the assumption
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
that the turnkey facility in Rochester
 
04:07:32.990 --> 04:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
does not apply for an expansion when its
 
04:07:34.990 --> 04:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
current permit expires in
 
04:07:37.870 --> 04:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
2034 The Operators of that facility
 
04:07:40.030 --> 04:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
however have stated publicly that they
 
04:07:43.109 --> 04:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
intend to do so we still also have the
 
04:07:45.790 --> 04:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
mount carbury landfill in Success New
 
04:07:48.229 --> 04:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is permitted to receive
 
04:07:51.309 --> 04:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
Municipal Solid Waste until at least
 
04:07:55.870 --> 04:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
2041 and Dees estimates or as of 2022
 
04:07:57.910 --> 04:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
estimated that at the current fill rate
 
04:08:02.429 --> 04:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
that facility may have capacity until
 
04:08:05.229 --> 04:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
2043 it is also critically important to
 
04:08:07.630 --> 04:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
point out that this is and this is the
 
04:08:09.910 --> 04:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
most powerful argument in support of a
 
04:08:12.670 --> 04:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
moratorium that de's projection for
 
04:08:15.309 --> 04:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
landfill Capac capacity need is based on
 
04:08:17.990 --> 04:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's solid waste
 
04:08:20.469 --> 04:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
needs and yet we continue to import
 
04:08:22.910 --> 04:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
nearly 50% of what we landfill from out
 
04:08:22.920 --> 04:08:23.670 align:start position:0%
nearly 50% of what we landfill from out
of

04:08:23.670 --> 04:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:08:26.910 --> 04:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
state one piece of testimony with regard
 
04:08:27.950 --> 04:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
to HB
 
04:08:30.030 --> 04:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
2115 asserted that there is an
 
04:08:33.229 --> 04:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
approaching C capacity crisis in New
 
04:08:35.630 --> 04:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
England well there is no capacity
 
04:08:38.590 --> 04:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
shortfall let alone crisis in New
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our statutes do not require us
 
04:08:42.550 --> 04:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
to become The Dumping Ground for the
 
04:08:44.950 --> 04:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
Region's trash and our constituents have
 
04:08:47.429 --> 04:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
made themselves clear time and again
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
that it is not the granite state that
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
they want to live in unless and until we
 
04:08:54.910 --> 04:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
do our job as a legislature and take
 
04:08:56.830 --> 04:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
take action to address this critical
 
04:08:58.950 --> 04:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
issue we should not be considering
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
opening another landfill that is not
 
04:09:05.070 --> 04:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
needed for New Hampshire's solid waste
 
04:09:07.510 --> 04:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
needs our new governor has openly
 
04:09:09.229 --> 04:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
expressed her concerns about these
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
issues and with this new alignment of
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
interests between this body and the
 
04:09:16.229 --> 04:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
governor we are in excellent position to
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
take meaningful action we have several
 
04:09:20.469 --> 04:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
pieces of good legislation for
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
consideration this year but we do not
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
have a bill currently before us that
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
will address the problem of out of-state
 
04:09:31.229 --> 04:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
waste now is the time to press pause
 
04:09:33.750 --> 04:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
when capacity need is not an issue and
 
04:09:36.030 --> 04:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
address concerns with the new landfill
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
sighting rules and the problem of outof
 
04:09:40.870 --> 04:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
State waste I thank you for your time
 
04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
and consideration and I am very happy to
 
04:09:43.359 --> 04:09:44.229 align:start position:0%
and consideration and I am very happy to
answer

04:09:44.229 --> 04:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
questions questions representative
 
04:09:50.309 --> 04:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
testifying on this
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
bill assuming we were to enact a
 
04:09:59.550 --> 04:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
moratorium and assuming we ran out of
 
04:10:02.309 --> 04:10:02.319 align:start position:0%
space in state would there be options
 
04:10:05.469 --> 04:10:05.479 align:start position:0%
for us to send our um Municipal Solid
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
Waste out of state and where would other
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
states like Massachusetts send their
 
04:10:12.349 --> 04:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
waste if they no longer had an
 
04:10:14.590 --> 04:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to send it here here thank
 
04:10:16.630 --> 04:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative i i
 
04:10:18.790 --> 04:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
i neither know nor particularly care
 
04:10:20.030 --> 04:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
where Massachusetts would send their
 
04:10:23.550 --> 04:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
waste if it's not here um and currently
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
we export about 10% of our waste uh so
 
04:10:29.070 --> 04:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
there are um you know with some of our
 
04:10:31.710 --> 04:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
border towns there is some Solid Waste
 
04:10:33.910 --> 04:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
going into neighboring states I imagine
 
04:10:35.550 --> 04:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
that would increase a little bit but
 
04:10:38.590 --> 04:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
other states unlike us have been very
 
04:10:40.510 --> 04:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
very specific about developing
 
04:10:42.670 --> 04:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
regulations particularly around the kind
 
04:10:43.710 --> 04:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
of waste to it's important to
 
04:10:45.149 --> 04:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
distinguish between the amount and the
 
04:10:48.510 --> 04:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
kind of waste for example uh in a number
 
04:10:50.149 --> 04:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
of other states I believe both in in
 
04:10:53.030 --> 04:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont and and Massachusetts you can't
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
landfill mattresses for example uh you
 
04:10:57.630 --> 04:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
can landfill mattresses here they send
 
04:10:59.870 --> 04:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
their mattresses here to landfill so
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
it's important to consider also when
 
04:11:03.389 --> 04:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
we're talking about what New Hampshire
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
waste goes out of state there are things
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
that we can't send into to mass
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont or Maine uh that
 
04:11:13.550 --> 04:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
we do actually take uh in return because
 
04:11:14.910 --> 04:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
they have regulations in place that we
 
04:11:17.070 --> 04:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
do not excellent thank you
 
04:11:19.790 --> 04:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative gerna um so with your
 
04:11:23.309 --> 04:11:23.319 align:start position:0%
reference to um items like mattresses
 
04:11:26.510 --> 04:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
and so forth um the this I do want to
 
04:11:27.910 --> 04:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
make it known that the solid waste
 
04:11:32.149 --> 04:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
working group is working on um you know
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
investigating programs where it would be
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
viable for us to not landfill those
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
things but in in ways to deconstruct
 
04:11:42.269 --> 04:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
them and recycle the parts and all sorts
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
of things and it's it's not only just
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
mattresses but there are other items
 
04:11:49.309 --> 04:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
that we are looking at but to the other
 
04:11:51.229 --> 04:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh the other question that had come up
 
04:11:51.239 --> 04:11:53.189 align:start position:0%
uh the other question that had come up
regarding

04:11:53.189 --> 04:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
um if we had a moratorium and at some
 
04:12:01.710 --> 04:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
point needed ran out of space to have
 
04:12:06.429 --> 04:12:06.439 align:start position:0%
our trash sent to or you know put put in
 
04:12:09.309 --> 04:12:09.319 align:start position:0%
and we would have to send that trash out
 
04:12:12.309 --> 04:12:12.319 align:start position:0%
of state somewhere what do you believe
 
04:12:15.510 --> 04:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
would be the cost to our municipalities
 
04:12:17.950 --> 04:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
in the event that that should
 
04:12:20.550 --> 04:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
happen thank you very much first of all
 
04:12:22.229 --> 04:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
Madam chair for the point about the work
 
04:12:24.070 --> 04:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
that the solid waste working group uh is
 
04:12:26.030 --> 04:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
doing so it's really great that we took
 
04:12:28.149 --> 04:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
the action we did earlier so uh and also
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
I know concern around you know Plastics
 
04:12:32.429 --> 04:12:32.439 align:start position:0%
and other things that we really need to
 
04:12:34.269 --> 04:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
divert so I appreciate the work that
 
04:12:36.630 --> 04:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
that group is doing I mean on some
 
04:12:38.109 --> 04:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
extent I'm going to push back a little
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
bit against the the question because I'm
 
04:12:42.910 --> 04:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
not really prepared to concede the idea
 
04:12:44.750 --> 04:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
that it's a danger of running out of
 
04:12:47.910 --> 04:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
capacity need um so I you know I'll I'll
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
kind of stake my ground there that that
 
04:12:52.750 --> 04:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
that question is fair enough is uh
 
04:12:54.990 --> 04:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
raises issues that I don't think are
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
going to happen Okay uh representative
 
04:12:58.950 --> 04:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
ktoa and then
 
04:13:01.349 --> 04:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
Bixby thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:13:01.359 --> 04:13:02.189 align:start position:0%
Bixby thank you madam chair and thank
you

04:13:02.189 --> 04:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:13:04.910 --> 04:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative for this bill um I do
 
04:13:08.349 --> 04:13:08.359 align:start position:0%
have a question for you I just went to
 
04:13:11.389 --> 04:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
um heard about our housing shortage in
 
04:13:15.950 --> 04:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and it's a it's a big
 
04:13:19.630 --> 04:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
deal and if we added another 100 to
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
200,000 people to the state of New
 
04:13:24.269 --> 04:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the next five
 
04:13:27.750 --> 04:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
years that is going to increase our
 
04:13:30.990 --> 04:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
waste how are we going to handle
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you I appreciate that
 
04:13:36.189 --> 04:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
question uh to kind of take it in two
 
04:13:39.070 --> 04:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
parts first I I think growth
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
on that scale is and I don't mean this
 
04:13:43.790 --> 04:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
with any disrespect but I I think is
 
04:13:46.030 --> 04:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
highly unlikely for a variety of reasons
 
04:13:47.469 --> 04:13:47.479 align:start position:0%
including we don't have the workforce to
 
04:13:49.710 --> 04:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
build on that scale presently so you
 
04:13:51.469 --> 04:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
know I I would love to see housing build
 
04:13:53.790 --> 04:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
up but it will be on a longer scale uh
 
04:13:55.990 --> 04:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll be prepared to deal with that
 
04:13:58.030 --> 04:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh the other part of my answer to your
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
question representative has to do with
 
04:14:01.710 --> 04:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
we have to address outof State waste so
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh if we address outof State waste uh
 
04:14:06.510 --> 04:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
our ability to deal with more waste
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
produced within the states is going to
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
grow uh and and I think in a very
 
04:14:13.349 --> 04:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
manageable way given probably the scale
 
04:14:15.309 --> 04:14:15.319 align:start position:0%
that we could even hope to see housing
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
increase representative comto
 
04:14:20.189 --> 04:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
followup and and thank you for that
 
04:14:21.750 --> 04:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
question and I know that the numbers I
 
04:14:24.389 --> 04:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
gave were pretty pretty large but um you
 
04:14:26.309 --> 04:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
know I'm looking at debris from building
 
04:14:28.750 --> 04:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
and things like that so there is waste
 
04:14:30.389 --> 04:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh associated with building new homes
 
04:14:32.830 --> 04:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
04:14:36.149 --> 04:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
but the other question is is you know
 
04:14:37.750 --> 04:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've always
 
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
talked about and I thought I understood
 
04:14:42.670 --> 04:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
but I was really enlightened when I went
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
on a a field trip last year with to
 
04:14:45.359 --> 04:14:47.189 align:start position:0%
on a a field trip last year with to
TurnKey

04:14:47.189 --> 04:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
TurnKey
 
04:14:50.030 --> 04:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
um was
 
04:14:53.950 --> 04:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
that TurnKey is a private
 
04:14:56.710 --> 04:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
facility so although they have to take
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
our waste until
 
04:15:03.229 --> 04:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
2034 we cannot tell them where to as
 
04:15:05.309 --> 04:15:05.319 align:start position:0%
long as they can meet our capacity we
 
04:15:07.590 --> 04:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
cannot tell a private company where they
 
04:15:10.830 --> 04:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
can or cannot take waste from is that
 
04:15:10.840 --> 04:15:13.149 align:start position:0%
can or cannot take waste from is that
correct

04:15:13.149 --> 04:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:15:15.149 --> 04:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
there is debate I thank you for the
 
04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
question and it's an excellent question
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
we had a bill last year obviously in
 
04:15:21.750 --> 04:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
this committee that would say 15% is is
 
04:15:25.790 --> 04:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
a cap there there is a debate about how
 
04:15:27.670 --> 04:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
far you can test the interstate commerce
 
04:15:29.149 --> 04:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
clause and when I when I served on a
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
study committee we had someone from the
 
04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office come in and
 
04:15:35.349 --> 04:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
they said there are grounds on which you
 
04:15:37.269 --> 04:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
can challenge the interstate commerce CL
 
04:15:39.710 --> 04:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
so uh it's an excellent question it is
 
04:15:42.269 --> 04:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
an open legal question about whether or
 
04:15:44.710 --> 04:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
not we could drw a line like that thank
 
04:15:46.269 --> 04:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby you had a
 
04:15:49.750 --> 04:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
question um yeah I I I'm just getting
 
04:15:52.590 --> 04:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to get back to the capacity issue
 
04:15:59.550 --> 04:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
and so um if we so uh we I think we
 
04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
heard earlier today that uh the
 
04:16:06.630 --> 04:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
permitted capacity for um TurnKey is up
 
04:16:06.640 --> 04:16:07.910 align:start position:0%
permitted capacity for um TurnKey is up
through

04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
3034 and or 20
 
04:16:15.070 --> 04:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
2034 and and uh I believe that
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
um uh which is five years after the
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
moratorium would end uh do you know what
 
04:16:27.389 --> 04:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
the capacity at uh Mount carbury is uh
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
or how long that how long that is good
 
04:16:31.870 --> 04:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
for they are thank you for the question
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
they are and and perhaps representative
 
04:16:35.950 --> 04:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
pens has some more information but I
 
04:16:38.910 --> 04:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
will say uh based on the 2122 banial
 
04:16:41.790 --> 04:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste report they are permitted to
 
04:16:45.109 --> 04:16:45.119 align:start position:0%
provide capacity to 2041 and as of that
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
report as they said Dees had estimated
 
04:16:49.510 --> 04:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
based on fill rates that it could be
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
extended at least a couple years to 2043
 
04:16:54.510 --> 04:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
with current fill rates so 2041
 
04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
potentially 2043 follow up sure follow
 
04:17:01.990 --> 04:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
up so it sounds like um we have plenty
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
of capacity to have a moratorium go
 
04:17:07.229 --> 04:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
until uh
 
04:17:12.429 --> 04:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
2030 uh and um just to clarify this is
 
04:17:15.910 --> 04:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
only this this pum is only on completely
 
04:17:19.189 --> 04:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
new uh landfills it doesn't have to do
 
04:17:24.349 --> 04:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
with uh with expansions so if uh it
 
04:17:26.269 --> 04:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
would not get in the way of TurnKey
 
04:17:27.950 --> 04:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
starting to submit their application for
 
04:17:30.149 --> 04:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
an expansion thank you for that
 
04:17:31.830 --> 04:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
clarifying question that's absolutely
 
04:17:34.070 --> 04:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
right it does not apply to expansions
 
04:17:35.910 --> 04:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
and as you said The Operators of TurnKey
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
have said publicly that they intend to
 
04:17:39.710 --> 04:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
apply for an expansion and that process
 
04:17:41.670 --> 04:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
would begin soon because it does take a
 
04:17:45.269 --> 04:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
little while so yes between uh TurnKey
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
and mount carbury we will continue to
 
04:17:50.229 --> 04:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
have capacity well beyond 2030 okay
 
04:17:50.239 --> 04:17:50.990 align:start position:0%
have capacity well beyond 2030 okay
thank

04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:17:55.870 --> 04:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:58.109 --> 04:17:58.119 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair and just to
 
04:17:59.590 --> 04:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
follow up on that in regards with
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
TurnKey because I've had Direct
 
04:18:03.149 --> 04:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
conversations with Waste Management
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
about that they would actually start the
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
process not that soon so I just want
 
04:18:09.550 --> 04:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
that to be clear um they were saying
 
04:18:13.870 --> 04:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
that would be 2028 and and uh 2029 is
 
04:18:15.990 --> 04:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
when they would start that process and
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's what I've heard have you heard
 
04:18:19.389 --> 04:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
the saying that's really the numbers
 
04:18:21.750 --> 04:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at here for when they
 
04:18:23.710 --> 04:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
would um start working on their
 
04:18:25.149 --> 04:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
application for an
 
04:18:27.309 --> 04:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
expansion thank you I hadn't heard those
 
04:18:30.189 --> 04:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
specific years but I know that it would
 
04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
relatively soon it's all relative right
 
04:18:33.870 --> 04:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
but uh they would want to do it a number
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
of years ahead of that 24 2034 date but
 
04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
so that sounds right to me followup sure
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
and during this time for morat do you
 
04:18:45.349 --> 04:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
believe that we can start really looking
 
04:18:47.790 --> 04:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
at um cuz you know landfills are the
 
04:18:49.790 --> 04:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
bottom of the barrel they're they're
 
04:18:51.550 --> 04:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
literally what we should be the last
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
resort that we could actually spend our
 
04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
time and focus on on other different
 
04:18:57.990 --> 04:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
types of unbelievable Technologies with
 
04:18:59.790 --> 04:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
Recycling incineration and all those
 
04:19:01.429 --> 04:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
things that we haven't even looked at in
 
04:19:04.189 --> 04:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
the state at this point yes absolutely
 
04:19:06.510 --> 04:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
and we've heard some good uh examples
 
04:19:08.229 --> 04:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
here like with the solid waste working
 
04:19:11.550 --> 04:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
group the uh food waste diversion which
 
04:19:13.149 --> 04:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
is starting next month that was a good
 
04:19:16.309 --> 04:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
first step uh the chair has spoken about
 
04:19:17.590 --> 04:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
the work that they're doing thinking
 
04:19:19.109 --> 04:19:19.119 align:start position:0%
about say mattresses and some other
 
04:19:21.109 --> 04:19:21.119 align:start position:0%
things that we want to stop landfilling
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
and there are a wide variety of
 
04:19:25.670 --> 04:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
technological possibilities and policy
 
04:19:27.550 --> 04:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
possibilities that a moratorium would
 
04:19:29.590 --> 04:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
allow us to
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
explore representative Howard and then
 
04:19:36.349 --> 04:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
Gruber thank you madam chair um well
 
04:19:37.830 --> 04:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
last session we talked a little bit
 
04:19:41.630 --> 04:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
about um a moratorium on private
 
04:19:43.229 --> 04:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
applications and
 
04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
exploring more publicly held um
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
landfills would would would that be
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.870 --> 04:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
consider or or on all landfills is
 
04:19:57.469 --> 04:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much representative so
 
04:19:59.830 --> 04:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
the the moratorium uh last year and this
 
04:20:01.790 --> 04:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
moratorium are across the board public
 
04:20:04.710 --> 04:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
and private the other piece that we
 
04:20:07.109 --> 04:20:07.119 align:start position:0%
talked about last year was the idea that
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
all landfills going forward would be
 
04:20:11.389 --> 04:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
publicly owned and leased to a private
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
operator if it was the state
 
04:20:16.830 --> 04:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
a county um so those are kind of two
 
04:20:20.189 --> 04:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
separate issues uh but in this case the
 
04:20:23.469 --> 04:20:23.479 align:start position:0%
moratorium would would apply across the
 
04:20:26.750 --> 04:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
board representative guber uh yes just
 
04:20:28.750 --> 04:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
want to follow up one more moment on
 
04:20:30.429 --> 04:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
capacity because I understand you did
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
not mention other landfills that could
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
be expanded such as the Lebanon landfill
 
04:20:40.389 --> 04:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
um some of other sites and second Point
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
um is that my understanding our
 
04:20:46.469 --> 04:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
diversion goals are 25% by 2030 so that
 
04:20:47.910 --> 04:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
actually do you think this would
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
actually help push us towards those
 
04:20:52.510 --> 04:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
diversion goals thank you very much
 
04:20:53.670 --> 04:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative it's important to point
 
04:20:56.429 --> 04:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
out Lebanon is is a public facility and
 
04:21:00.149 --> 04:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
it has a very it is um what's the word
 
04:21:02.469 --> 04:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for um they're they don't
 
04:21:04.630 --> 04:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
they're not open to all sources
 
04:21:06.149 --> 04:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
specifically for Lebanon maybe what
 
04:21:08.149 --> 04:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
contracts they have there so they that
 
04:21:09.870 --> 04:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't count in terms of of
 
04:21:11.830 --> 04:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
meeting capacity need for the state as
 
04:21:14.590 --> 04:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
as a whole but to your second question
 
04:21:17.149 --> 04:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
yes I I I think that diversion which is
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
supposed to be driving our Solid Waste
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
Management plan the the very purpose of
 
04:21:26.590 --> 04:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
the moratorium is to to force us to
 
04:21:29.630 --> 04:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
really aggressively take on the issue of
 
04:21:32.910 --> 04:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
diversion representative Ken thank you
 
04:21:34.109 --> 04:21:34.119 align:start position:0%
again Madam
 
04:21:37.870 --> 04:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
chair I'm of the strong contention that
 
04:21:42.269 --> 04:21:42.279 align:start position:0%
the Silver Bullet of landfills is waste
 
04:21:45.550 --> 04:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
energy plants incineration plants my
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
concern with a moratorium is that you
 
04:21:51.870 --> 04:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
know it could take a few years to get
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
the Investments to build the waste
 
04:21:56.830 --> 04:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
energy plant and in order for waste
 
04:21:58.950 --> 04:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
energy plants to be
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
viable um financially for the
 
04:22:05.510 --> 04:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities you know to to spend
 
04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
their tipping fees at a waste of energy
 
04:22:09.550 --> 04:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
plant instead of a landfill we have to
 
04:22:11.349 --> 04:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
we have to get rid of landfills as an
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
option and my concern is that with a
 
04:22:18.670 --> 04:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
moratorium of only 5 years that
 
04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities or businesses will be
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
they'll feel disinclined to want to make
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
that capital investment in waste energy
 
04:22:28.109 --> 04:22:28.119 align:start position:0%
plants because they'll think well the
 
04:22:30.189 --> 04:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
moratorium is almost up here in a couple
 
04:22:32.349 --> 04:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
years uh and then we can they'll just
 
04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
want to go right back to you know
 
04:22:36.670 --> 04:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
landfills and then all this money that
 
04:22:39.950 --> 04:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
we put into the waste energy plant is
 
04:22:42.590 --> 04:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
going to go bankrupt and I'm just
 
04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
wondering how you feel about the idea of
 
04:22:49.309 --> 04:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
instead of a moratorium just a or excuse
 
04:22:50.590 --> 04:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
me a temporary
 
04:22:54.030 --> 04:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
moratorium um an indefinite moratorium
 
04:22:57.469 --> 04:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
where now it sends a signal to everybody
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
who would be an investor in um a waste
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
of energy plant that yes we mean this
 
04:23:08.349 --> 04:23:08.359 align:start position:0%
for reals and you will have you will
 
04:23:11.309 --> 04:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
have the requisite trash needed to make
 
04:23:14.109 --> 04:23:14.119 align:start position:0%
the waste energy PL financially viable
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts thank you
 
04:23:18.630 --> 04:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative I see the The Five-Year
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
moratorium as a policy tool it gives us
 
04:23:26.149 --> 04:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
the option to explore a variety of
 
04:23:28.870 --> 04:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
options while having press pause right
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to considerations about
 
04:23:33.830 --> 04:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
waste to energy for example uh this is a
 
04:23:35.870 --> 04:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
time period in which potential investors
 
04:23:38.349 --> 04:23:38.359 align:start position:0%
can explore that landscape and decide
 
04:23:40.670 --> 04:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not it is something that that
 
04:23:42.670 --> 04:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
they want to invest in and and there are
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
a whole set of other policy
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
possibilities that we could explore so
 
04:23:48.830 --> 04:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's important to point out that that
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
is the specific purpose of this
 
04:23:53.149 --> 04:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
moratorium is to provide us a window of
 
04:23:55.630 --> 04:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
time where we have a pause to explore
 
04:23:59.550 --> 04:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
multiple options follow up followup
 
04:24:01.750 --> 04:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
could you see that towards the end of
 
04:24:03.870 --> 04:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
the the time frame of this moratorium
 
04:24:07.510 --> 04:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
that instead we either um expand the
 
04:24:09.710 --> 04:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
date of the moratorium or make it
 
04:24:12.990 --> 04:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
indefinite at the End of This this term
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I don't want
 
04:24:15.469 --> 04:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
to speculate on that it's certainly
 
04:24:17.950 --> 04:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
always a possibility uh but I don't want
 
04:24:20.510 --> 04:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
to speculate as to what we might do in
 
04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
2028 or 2029 with a moratorium okay
 
04:24:25.790 --> 04:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
04:24:28.030 --> 04:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
representative Barber thank you madam
 
04:24:30.349 --> 04:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative I have a
 
04:24:33.510 --> 04:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
question regarding the bill um would it
 
04:24:35.830 --> 04:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
be possible to add a mechanism to the
 
04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
bill that would require an exploratory
 
04:24:43.309 --> 04:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
committee to research alternatives
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
right in the bill rather than taking to
 
04:24:48.590 --> 04:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
chance that that would actually
 
04:24:50.510 --> 04:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
happen thank you very much
 
04:24:52.830 --> 04:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative we've actually had uh a
 
04:24:55.389 --> 04:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
number of study committees already uh on
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
this issue I was on one representative
 
04:24:59.109 --> 04:24:59.119 align:start position:0%
eel referred to one a few years ago that
 
04:25:01.269 --> 04:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
she was on Madame chair has referred to
 
04:25:02.790 --> 04:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
the work of the solid waste working
 
04:25:04.630 --> 04:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
group and they are often making
 
04:25:06.389 --> 04:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations again our food waste
 
04:25:08.510 --> 04:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
diversion which is going in next week
 
04:25:09.790 --> 04:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
would came out of the work of the solid
 
04:25:12.510 --> 04:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
waste working group um so I don't see
 
04:25:14.229 --> 04:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
the need for a study committee such as
 
04:25:15.870 --> 04:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
you describe I think a lot of that work
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
has already been done and now it's our
 
04:25:21.189 --> 04:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility to enact it in
 
04:25:23.550 --> 04:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
legislation any other
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh for introducing that bill and
 
04:25:31.229 --> 04:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
fielding all those questions um I now
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:47.349 --> 04:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:49.710 --> 04:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh I'm representative
 
04:25:52.030 --> 04:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
Terry Spar and uh I just wanted to share
 
04:25:54.670 --> 04:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
with you my perspective and uh sort of
 
04:25:56.910 --> 04:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
echoing representative ger yes
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
practically half of uh you know waste in
 
04:26:01.790 --> 04:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
our landfills here in New Hampshire is
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
imported from surrounding states and uh
 
04:26:07.590 --> 04:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
why is that uh because the big players
 
04:26:09.469 --> 04:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
in the business have made the rules at
 
04:26:10.950 --> 04:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
the very expense of New Hampshire
 
04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
citizens and this this isn't the be the
 
04:26:17.070 --> 04:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
benign trash that uh we had 70 years ago
 
04:26:19.030 --> 04:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
this trash these days is full of
 
04:26:21.630 --> 04:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
volatile organic chemicals or compounds
 
04:26:25.710 --> 04:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me pasas toxic chemicals and more
 
04:26:27.990 --> 04:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh in Massachusetts and Vermont you
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
can't landfill rugs as was mentioned and
 
04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh the reason being is because they've
 
04:26:35.630 --> 04:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
got pasas in them uh but guess where you
 
04:26:39.030 --> 04:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
can dump them right here it's wrong and
 
04:26:40.750 --> 04:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh all this trash will be stewing in
 
04:26:42.750 --> 04:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
these landfills for decades
 
04:26:44.510 --> 04:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh and may eventually leech at some
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
point into their
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
waterways uh these landfills May well
 
04:26:51.309 --> 04:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
very be uh very excuse me may very well
 
04:26:53.469 --> 04:26:53.479 align:start position:0%
become Future Super fund sites we just
 
04:26:54.510 --> 04:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
that uh I I I just how can to me how
 
04:27:00.149 --> 04:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
could any New Hampshire resident of
 
04:27:03.710 --> 04:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
sound mine aware of this issue support
 
04:27:05.309 --> 04:27:05.319 align:start position:0%
any action that will jeopardize
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
themselves or their you know their their
 
04:27:08.510 --> 04:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
future generations and their
 
04:27:11.469 --> 04:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
families uh why uh should we residents
 
04:27:13.389 --> 04:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
suffer while few people take advantage
 
04:27:15.790 --> 04:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
of us and reap in the millions of
 
04:27:18.710 --> 04:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
dollars we must stop all new
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
landfills uh landfill permits as uh the
 
04:27:23.990 --> 04:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill proposes encap our incoming waste
 
04:27:26.950 --> 04:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
from outside States the current excuse
 
04:27:29.710 --> 04:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
me the current trajectory is a disaster
 
04:27:31.349 --> 04:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
it's wrong and it hurts every resident
 
04:27:33.790 --> 04:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
of this great state we're not protecting
 
04:27:36.630 --> 04:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
our citizens and uh we are certainly not
 
04:27:39.389 --> 04:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
making New Hampshire any stronger thank
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
you any questions represent Penza I'm
 
04:27:45.469 --> 04:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
not sure if you if you said it or I
 
04:27:47.349 --> 04:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
missed it can you tell me where you what
 
04:27:49.229 --> 04:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
what district do you represent Grafton
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
County uh Hanover lime area right near
 
04:27:53.710 --> 04:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
the Lebanon dump oh wonderful can I have
 
04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
a followup um I was lucky to visit the
 
04:27:59.790 --> 04:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
that landfill which is um seems to be a
 
04:28:02.349 --> 04:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
really good balance and design and of
 
04:28:03.630 --> 04:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
course they're only taking in New
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just because it's got the
 
04:28:08.109 --> 04:28:08.119 align:start position:0%
public piece to it um have you spent any
 
04:28:10.670 --> 04:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
time in researching at all uh that LE
 
04:28:13.550 --> 04:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
Phil uh I have not personally we used to
 
04:28:16.269 --> 04:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
uh take our uh waste there and then we
 
04:28:20.349 --> 04:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
recently representative M King thank you
 
04:28:24.030 --> 04:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking
 
04:28:25.670 --> 04:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
questions you bring up an interesting
 
04:28:29.670 --> 04:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
point um which is uh the topic of pasas
 
04:28:32.070 --> 04:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
so you know in New Hampshire we might
 
04:28:35.109 --> 04:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
have bans on um let's say we enacted
 
04:28:37.630 --> 04:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
some bans on what could be disposed of
 
04:28:41.670 --> 04:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
in our landfills but um do you believe
 
04:28:45.469 --> 04:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
that we would still be open to ex so
 
04:28:48.349 --> 04:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
like let's say we um we prevent P from
 
04:28:51.710 --> 04:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
being sold in in um in our products in
 
04:28:54.710 --> 04:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but products containing
 
04:28:57.510 --> 04:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
pasas in other states would potentially
 
04:28:59.469 --> 04:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
still be dumped here and it might be an
 
04:29:01.950 --> 04:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
item like like a rug that you said we
 
04:29:05.030 --> 04:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a ban on rugs but because our
 
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
rugs don't have P their out ofate rugs
 
04:29:09.910 --> 04:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
do have past and now we're inadvertently
 
04:29:12.149 --> 04:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
getting past into our landfills is that
 
04:29:14.590 --> 04:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying um I I you
 
04:29:16.630 --> 04:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
know I I went to the soil waste working
 
04:29:18.950 --> 04:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
group on Friday and uh you know we
 
04:29:20.269 --> 04:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely have to do a better job of
 
04:29:25.750 --> 04:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
recycling and uh I don't know um where
 
04:29:27.710 --> 04:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know past rules are and
 
04:29:29.870 --> 04:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
regulations and and but I certain I know
 
04:29:32.910 --> 04:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
we the the I think the FED just got uh
 
04:29:34.229 --> 04:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
got rid of two different ones or
 
04:29:37.830 --> 04:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
something but uh we I we shouldn't have
 
04:29:39.950 --> 04:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
pfest in our in our in our materials and
 
04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
our products I just and whether that's
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
just new Hamp and we go that route
 
04:29:44.790 --> 04:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's fine but I don't think that we
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely shouldn't have it be you know
 
04:29:51.429 --> 04:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:53.790 --> 04:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
state any other
 
04:29:57.030 --> 04:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
today call John Swan from safe Forest
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and uh

04:30:33.630 --> 04:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 171 uh my name is John Swan
 
04:30:36.510 --> 04:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
I'm the founder of save Forest Lake and
 
04:30:39.229 --> 04:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
I need to preface my testimony by
 
04:30:41.109 --> 04:30:41.119 align:start position:0%
stating that in order to not get sued by
 
04:30:44.109 --> 04:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
cassella for third time I need you to
 
04:30:45.389 --> 04:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
understand that all of this is my
 
04:30:48.269 --> 04:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
opinion based on my research and
 
04:30:50.349 --> 04:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
experience um I also did want to point
 
04:30:52.469 --> 04:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
out for the record that online uh
 
04:30:55.750 --> 04:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
testimony it looks like 259 citizens
 
04:30:58.990 --> 04:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
signed in in support of this uh very
 
04:31:00.510 --> 04:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
important piece of
 
04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
legislation um I did send my testimony
 
04:31:06.030 --> 04:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
with a supportive documents to the
 
04:31:07.590 --> 04:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
committee I hope you received that had a
 
04:31:09.389 --> 04:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
chance to take a look at it because
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good stuff in there
 
04:31:15.910 --> 04:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
relative to why we need this um landfill
 
04:31:15.920 --> 04:31:17.990 align:start position:0%
relative to why we need this um landfill
moratorium

04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
moratorium
 
04:31:21.109 --> 04:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
um several times I've heard already uh
 
04:31:24.990 --> 04:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
the word crisis brought up and that's a
 
04:31:27.389 --> 04:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
that's a very good word and I like the
 
04:31:29.109 --> 04:31:29.119 align:start position:0%
conversation that's been going on this
 
04:31:32.070 --> 04:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
is something that can continue during
 
04:31:33.670 --> 04:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
this moratorium when we decide what
 
04:31:35.510 --> 04:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to do we have a lot of smart
 
04:31:37.389 --> 04:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
people on this state including on the
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group who could be
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
tasked with working on this etc etc
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
however I want to point out that we have
 
04:31:46.149 --> 04:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
a fantastic
 
04:31:49.349 --> 04:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to prevent a future crisis
 
04:31:51.830 --> 04:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
in fact there's no time machine needed
 
04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
to go back in time and stop it we can
 
04:31:57.510 --> 04:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
stop the proposed Granite State landfill
 
04:32:00.830 --> 04:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
in Dalton and Bethlehem at Douglas Drive
 
04:32:02.429 --> 04:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
next to Forest Lake we have the
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity with this moratorium to get
 
04:32:05.040 --> 04:32:06.309 align:start position:0%
opportunity with this moratorium to get
it

04:32:06.309 --> 04:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:32:09.750 --> 04:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
right I brought a friend with me today
 
04:32:11.229 --> 04:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
not really friend but someone I've grown
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
very intimate with over the course of
 
04:32:17.349 --> 04:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
the six years this is a a map a drawing
 
04:32:19.630 --> 04:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
of the NCS landfill in
 
04:32:23.229 --> 04:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem and the uh the mapping is from
 
04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
the uh July 2024 Tri anual groundwater
 
04:32:29.910 --> 04:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring report uh provided to Dees by
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
Sanborn head on behalf of cassella NCS
 
04:32:36.630 --> 04:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
the markups on there are mine and I just
 
04:32:38.670 --> 04:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
want to show this is a 30-year-old
 
04:32:42.189 --> 04:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
landfill in Bethlehem it has grown and
 
04:32:45.229 --> 04:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
grown over the course of 30 years when
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
cassella first bought this small little
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
um pretty much local Municipal landfill
 
04:32:57.349 --> 04:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh back in uh 1993 94 they touted it as
 
04:32:59.790 --> 04:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
a state-of-the-art landfill that they
 
04:33:02.109 --> 04:33:02.119 align:start position:0%
would be building in fact they bragged
 
04:33:05.349 --> 04:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
about Excavating the old unlined
 
04:33:10.230 --> 04:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
landfill that is here in the uh stage
 
04:33:12.429 --> 04:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
two it shows right there approximate
 
04:33:16.189 --> 04:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
extent of former unlined landfill in the
 
04:33:19.109 --> 04:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
Box over stage two so they excavated
 
04:33:21.789 --> 04:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
that put that into the new stage one
 
04:33:25.470 --> 04:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
area and then Dees and cassella
 
04:33:27.470 --> 04:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
everybody involved blessed the
 
04:33:30.189 --> 04:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
excavation you got all the
 
04:33:33.109 --> 04:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
contamination build stage two so it was
 
04:33:35.709 --> 04:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
approved and yet
 
04:33:39.390 --> 04:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
today this is the July 2024 tri-annual
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
groundwater report this is my markup on
 
04:33:45.629 --> 04:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
there these are posos detections
 
04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
according to the report from Sanborn
 
04:33:52.990 --> 04:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
head submitted to Dees this is what we
 
04:33:55.150 --> 04:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to prevent from
 
04:33:59.070 --> 04:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
being recreated six miles away next to
 
04:34:02.470 --> 04:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake State Park as you can see
 
04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
according to the data provided and most
 
04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
people don't like to read the reports
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
because they're very long and they're
 
04:34:10.390 --> 04:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
very entailed I've had to learn how to
 
04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
read science scientific
 
04:34:16.510 --> 04:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
data of the uh Wells there were 19 Wells
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
um that had a total of 107 total
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
different Posas compounds
 
04:34:25.109 --> 04:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
detected eight of those had exceedence
 
04:34:27.189 --> 04:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
of the ambient groundwater quality
 
04:34:29.310 --> 04:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
standard or
 
04:34:32.670 --> 04:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
aqs I also would want to point out that
 
04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
this entire landfill is cited
 
04:34:40.470 --> 04:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
within the Watershed of the AMC River
 
04:34:42.869 --> 04:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
which is right here
 
04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
it all flows northward to the AMC
 
04:34:51.789 --> 04:34:51.799 align:start position:0%
River there was a 78% increase in total
 
04:34:55.830 --> 04:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
posos levels from prior 2023 2024
 
04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
testing at 12 Wells that had prior
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
testing I went through and did the math
 
04:35:04.470 --> 04:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
78% increase that's pretty
 
04:35:07.310 --> 04:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
significant and I will add that both
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
Dees and the owner operator and Sanborn
 
04:35:14.189 --> 04:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
head have relied on the the story The
 
04:35:17.269 --> 04:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
Alibi I call it that it's the old
 
04:35:20.269 --> 04:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
unlined landfill that is causing Mr
 
04:35:22.429 --> 04:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
contamination yes could you please uh
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
direct your comments to the idea of
 
04:35:28.150 --> 04:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
establishing a moratorium yes okay
 
04:35:29.830 --> 04:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
basically what I'm trying to say is that
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
this would be the same owner operator
 
04:35:36.150 --> 04:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
Engineers contractors building a new
 
04:35:38.750 --> 04:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
landfill that's not needed nor not
 
04:35:42.269 --> 04:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
wanted it's not wanted and
 
04:35:43.551 --> 04:35:43.561 align:start position:0%
we have a great opportunity here with
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
this moratorium to get it right as
 
04:35:48.670 --> 04:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
representative King spoke to there's
 
04:35:50.590 --> 04:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for other technologies that
 
04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
could be utilized we have smart people
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
in the room who can solve this problem
 
04:35:58.390 --> 04:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
but please this moratorium gives us an
 
04:36:00.510 --> 04:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity we don't need a time machine
 
04:36:04.230 --> 04:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
to go back and fix the problem we can
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
why is this not being remediated right
 
04:36:08.670 --> 04:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
now in
 
04:36:12.349 --> 04:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
fact this mailer from Cass sent to the
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
North Country touts keeping us safe in
 
04:36:17.709 --> 04:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
the North Country this is a relatively
 
04:36:21.269 --> 04:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
new mailer yet this speaks differently
 
04:36:23.070 --> 04:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
so the point of the moratorium and the
 
04:36:25.629 --> 04:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
PO point of my testimony is that we need
 
04:36:29.109 --> 04:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
to learn from the mistakes of the past
 
04:36:31.629 --> 04:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
this is like St gobain wanting another
 
04:36:33.869 --> 04:36:33.879 align:start position:0%
facility somewhere in the North Country
 
04:36:35.429 --> 04:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
would we allow it knowing what we know
 
04:36:38.910 --> 04:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
about St go Bain today no and why is
 
04:36:41.269 --> 04:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
this not being mitigated in fact I have
 
04:36:45.230 --> 04:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
gone into the AMC River three times now
 
04:36:48.029 --> 04:36:48.039 align:start position:0%
there is a seep at this
 
04:36:50.789 --> 04:36:50.799 align:start position:0%
location it's like a small waterfall
 
04:36:53.709 --> 04:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
cascading into the AMC River I've tested
 
04:36:58.551 --> 04:36:58.561 align:start position:0%
it three times I waited across tested it
 
04:37:01.869 --> 04:37:01.879 align:start position:0%
uh last year in October or 2023 in
 
04:37:05.949 --> 04:37:05.959 align:start position:0%
October twice in 2024 June and August
 
04:37:08.349 --> 04:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
all three lab reports came back for the
 
04:37:12.150 --> 04:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
same four to five posos compounds in
 
04:37:15.990 --> 04:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
that water cascading off of the NCS
 
04:37:18.949 --> 04:37:18.959 align:start position:0%
property into the AMC
 
04:37:21.910 --> 04:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
River yet the department still does not
 
04:37:23.910 --> 04:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
require that surface runoff going into
 
04:37:26.670 --> 04:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
the Amon River to be tested I'm the only
 
04:37:28.750 --> 04:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
one that's tested
 
04:37:32.150 --> 04:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
it so perhaps you can ask the department
 
04:37:34.269 --> 04:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
another question why aren't they
 
04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
requiring that surface water runoff
 
04:37:40.390 --> 04:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
going off of the property into the AMC
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
River why is that not being tested for
 
04:37:45.269 --> 04:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
posos and whatever contaminants that
 
04:37:47.590 --> 04:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
could be in there it's the same four to
 
04:37:52.269 --> 04:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
five posos including pooa so and that is
 
04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
uh EPA deemed that a hazardous compound
 
04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
last April so again the point is let's
 
04:38:01.269 --> 04:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
learn from history and I think uh we
 
04:38:05.070 --> 04:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
don't need to reward a uh owner operator
 
04:38:07.629 --> 04:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
with a new landfill when we have an
 
04:38:10.230 --> 04:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get it right next time if
 
04:38:13.869 --> 04:38:13.879 align:start position:0%
we even need another landfill so thank
 
04:38:16.429 --> 04:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions from the
 
04:38:20.070 --> 04:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
04:38:23.349 --> 04:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
testimony and I call Nat
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:31.510 --> 04:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
Bia thank you madam chair n Grace uh for
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
the business and industry Association
 
04:38:35.709 --> 04:38:35.719 align:start position:0%
the uh Statewide Chamber of Commerce we
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
legislation um I I at the
 
04:38:44.029 --> 04:38:44.039 align:start position:0%
prompting of the chair's question about
 
04:38:46.869 --> 04:38:46.879 align:start position:0%
the Statewide working group I should add
 
04:38:48.470 --> 04:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
that I probably should have added
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
another sentence to my letter uh after
 
04:38:53.910 --> 04:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
the first sentence um just basically
 
04:38:57.150 --> 04:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
noting that different policy Decisions
 
04:38:59.949 --> 04:38:59.959 align:start position:0%
by legislators uh by the legislature
 
04:39:03.150 --> 04:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
will determine whether or not uh we have
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
our capacity estimate of 2034 is correct
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
or not um it's possible that in addition
 
04:39:08.480 --> 04:39:09.670 align:start position:0%
or not um it's possible that in addition
to

04:39:09.670 --> 04:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:39:11.869 --> 04:39:11.879 align:start position:0%
decreasing um capacity based on
 
04:39:14.109 --> 04:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
something like soil standards for p
 
04:39:18.349 --> 04:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
which may require landfilling of soil um
 
04:39:20.750 --> 04:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
other options such as you know Banning
 
04:39:23.830 --> 04:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
carpets or um as legislation this year
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh would do uh removing some paint from
 
04:39:29.510 --> 04:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
the uh from the waist stream would
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
increase that capacity by some some
 
04:39:33.750 --> 04:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
amount so I just want to make sure that
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
was clear on the record that that that
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
2034 number I do recognize that's just
 
04:39:41.550 --> 04:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
an estimate um the other thing I want to
 
04:39:44.628 --> 04:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
point out on the capacity side of things
 
04:39:48.430 --> 04:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh is that uh Dees is permitting also
 
04:39:51.948 --> 04:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
has a max intake um so even if some
 
04:39:55.150 --> 04:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
facilities are allowed to continue to
 
04:39:58.590 --> 04:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
take waste past 2034 past uh whenever
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
kind of we hit the break even Point here
 
04:40:03.030 --> 04:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
um that that doesn't mean that's going
 
04:40:05.070 --> 04:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
to meet all of the need of for the waste
 
04:40:06.990 --> 04:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
generated in New Hampshire the same
 
04:40:09.990 --> 04:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
level capacity um and I I do want to
 
04:40:12.708 --> 04:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
point out that the capacity question is
 
04:40:15.030 --> 04:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
really a regional question um and it's
 
04:40:16.750 --> 04:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
really a Cost question because even if
 
04:40:19.628 --> 04:40:19.638 align:start position:0%
it ends up being the case that you know
 
04:40:21.868 --> 04:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
we in New Hampshire have to export more
 
04:40:24.150 --> 04:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
waste the ultimate question is well how
 
04:40:26.590 --> 04:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
much is that going to cost people who
 
04:40:29.708 --> 04:40:29.718 align:start position:0%
throw away things um while we can
 
04:40:32.628 --> 04:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
certainly take uh make policy decisions
 
04:40:36.590 --> 04:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
that reduce uh the need for landfilling
 
04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
if we're landfilling and it turns out
 
04:40:41.830 --> 04:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
that we're having to truck that out to
 
04:40:44.670 --> 04:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
Ohio or something uh you know that's
 
04:40:48.030 --> 04:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
going to add additional costs um that's
 
04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
part of the calculus
 
04:40:52.830 --> 04:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
here um and and part of the business
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
analysis that waste disposal companies
 
04:40:57.990 --> 04:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
do when they look at you know are we
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to open a facility like a mattress
 
04:41:03.030 --> 04:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
recycling facility or are we going to uh
 
04:41:04.948 --> 04:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
apply for a new landfill so that's all
 
04:41:07.150 --> 04:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
part of that overall calculus that I
 
04:41:10.070 --> 04:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I pointed out um which
 
04:41:12.670 --> 04:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
goes to kind of the overall concern we
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
have here is not only in the timing and
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
the capacity but the ultimate question
 
04:41:20.590 --> 04:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
here of the cost and and the cost of
 
04:41:24.830 --> 04:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
businesses um which obviously produce um
 
04:41:28.628 --> 04:41:28.638 align:start position:0%
produce uh land fillable materials um
 
04:41:31.070 --> 04:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
and how much that may increase depending
 
04:41:34.470 --> 04:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
on exactly how the uh what policy
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
decisions are made I hope that was clear
 
04:41:39.750 --> 04:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly happy to take questions if
 
04:41:41.948 --> 04:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
the committee has any represent Bixby
 
04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
then M yes so you bring up the point
 
04:41:48.390 --> 04:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
that uh solid waste disposal is a reason
 
04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
Regional issue uh however I I guess one
 
04:41:55.190 --> 04:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
of the things that I'm wondering is if
 
04:41:57.788 --> 04:41:57.798 align:start position:0%
all of the states around us have put
 
04:42:00.590 --> 04:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
bans on particular things going into
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
their landfills why should New Hampshire
 
04:42:05.910 --> 04:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
take the burden
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
of uh of taking on the trash from the
 
04:42:12.150 --> 04:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
states that have banded in their own
 
04:42:15.670 --> 04:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
States I it's is is that does not seem
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
like a good business proposition for New
 
04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well I I think that's a
 
04:42:22.070 --> 04:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
different issue than the one in front of
 
04:42:23.948 --> 04:42:23.958 align:start position:0%
you you know if you want to ban certain
 
04:42:26.190 --> 04:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
materials from going into a landfill
 
04:42:29.030 --> 04:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's different than an overall banon
 
04:42:32.390 --> 04:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
landfills um so to use our favorite
 
04:42:36.310 --> 04:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
example P um much of that uh is being
 
04:42:38.670 --> 04:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
shipped to Canada for landfilling at the
 
04:42:41.708 --> 04:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
moment um if Canada decides they're not
 
04:42:45.910 --> 04:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
taking um sludge sorry much of the
 
04:42:47.310 --> 04:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
sludge collected from wastewater
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities which contains p is
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
being sent to Canada for land filling at
 
04:42:53.788 --> 04:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
the moment um if Canada decides to ban
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
the import of sludge um that has to go
 
04:42:58.830 --> 04:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere else um it cannot be for
 
04:43:01.270 --> 04:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
instance land applied in Maine um
 
04:43:03.430 --> 04:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
because Maine has banned that um so if
 
04:43:06.990 --> 04:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
we make a policy decision like uh Maine
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
is was to make uh which results in a
 
04:43:14.550 --> 04:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
change in how we handle that product um
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's a different question than well
 
04:43:20.830 --> 04:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
can someone open a landfill or
 
04:43:25.550 --> 04:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
not okay representative Miner was next
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you madam chairman it's
 
04:43:28.910 --> 04:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
interesting uh one of your last comments
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
was the cost of disposing of um all
 
04:43:33.270 --> 04:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
these materials that are coming from out
 
04:43:35.550 --> 04:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
of state but correct me if I'm wrong the
 
04:43:37.590 --> 04:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
cost doesn't go to the company the cost
 
04:43:39.990 --> 04:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
goes to us we we pay for we pay for the
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
disposal it's it's not like the it's not
 
04:43:43.910 --> 04:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
like these large corporations are losing
 
04:43:46.150 --> 04:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
money they're in fact making
 
04:43:48.868 --> 04:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
money I is there a question there yes
 
04:43:52.230 --> 04:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry do you agree with that
 
04:43:54.628 --> 04:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
statement well I don't disagree I mean
 
04:43:56.190 --> 04:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
if you're a company you're in the
 
04:43:58.190 --> 04:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
business of making money and if it's the
 
04:43:59.948 --> 04:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
cheapest place to put the land fillable
 
04:44:02.310 --> 04:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
materials is New Hampshire then that's
 
04:44:03.948 --> 04:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
where you're going to ship them I mean
 
04:44:07.230 --> 04:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
that's just basic economics thank you
 
04:44:09.750 --> 04:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay um representative Howard was
 
04:44:14.390 --> 04:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
next thank you Madam chair um
 
04:44:17.788 --> 04:44:17.798 align:start position:0%
so waste management is a is a profitable
 
04:44:21.070 --> 04:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
business I I imagine and and this your
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
concern about costs has to do with your
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
bottom line so the fact that we that we
 
04:44:29.470 --> 04:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
are taking garbage from around the the
 
04:44:31.310 --> 04:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
way that you make your highest profit is
 
04:44:32.910 --> 04:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
taking garbage from the New England
 
04:44:36.550 --> 04:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
region so do you I I we spoke to you
 
04:44:39.470 --> 04:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
know we had a Bia um person come last
 
04:44:41.628 --> 04:44:41.638 align:start position:0%
session to talk to us about this too and
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
what I failed to ask her is what I want
 
04:44:45.510 --> 04:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
to ask you and is that that is are all
 
04:44:49.750 --> 04:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:53.628 --> 04:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
equal I'm not sure what you mean by that
 
04:44:55.310 --> 04:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
question I
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
mean profit at any at any cost or at any
 
04:45:03.390 --> 04:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
you know is is that is that does that
 
04:45:07.390 --> 04:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
sit well with you as an organization and
 
04:45:09.550 --> 04:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
well so the point I was trying to make
 
04:45:11.550 --> 04:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
which I don't think necessarily
 
04:45:14.990 --> 04:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
articulated clearly but maybe a more
 
04:45:16.948 --> 04:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
personal example will make sense is you
 
04:45:18.990 --> 04:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
know I live in conquered we have a pay
 
04:45:22.150 --> 04:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
as you throw system um where we buy
 
04:45:24.070 --> 04:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
purple plastic bags from the grocery
 
04:45:26.190 --> 04:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
store and you you pay based on how much
 
04:45:30.830 --> 04:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
you throw out right um and that cost is
 
04:45:32.990 --> 04:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
negotiated between conquered and the
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
waste disposal company and that cost is
 
04:45:38.310 --> 04:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
based on what the waste the various
 
04:45:41.230 --> 04:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
waste disposal companies bid for for
 
04:45:45.110 --> 04:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
that so kind of at a residential level
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
that cost is in large part dictated by
 
04:45:50.948 --> 04:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
what we do with our our trash so in
 
04:45:52.750 --> 04:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
conquered it goes to the wheeler plant
 
04:45:55.670 --> 04:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
they burn it um but you know in other
 
04:45:57.470 --> 04:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
places it ends up in different landfills
 
04:45:59.470 --> 04:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the state but if it's the
 
04:46:02.350 --> 04:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
case that we that the states surrounding
 
04:46:06.110 --> 04:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
us uh are not making policies that allow
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
them to landfill
 
04:46:13.470 --> 04:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
um enough even to take exports from us
 
04:46:15.390 --> 04:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
if we run out of capacity for New
 
04:46:19.110 --> 04:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs then if it turns out
 
04:46:22.110 --> 04:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
that my trash uh you know has to end up
 
04:46:25.510 --> 04:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
getting shipped to Ohio that cost is
 
04:46:28.708 --> 04:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
going to be probably larger than it is
 
04:46:30.948 --> 04:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
to get shipped up to Penacook and burned
 
04:46:32.990 --> 04:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
but would we have to ship it to Ohio if
 
04:46:35.948 --> 04:46:35.958 align:start position:0%
we just stop taking Maine and Vermont
 
04:46:38.110 --> 04:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts trash well I think
 
04:46:39.868 --> 04:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
that goes to the question of you know
 
04:46:43.030 --> 04:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
what can we do at the com Clause I'm I'm
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:49.708 --> 04:46:49.718 align:start position:0%
today representative
 
04:46:53.030 --> 04:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
Penza uh thank you madam chair
 
04:46:55.390 --> 04:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to understand a couple
 
04:46:57.430 --> 04:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
things first um can we just on the
 
04:46:59.548 --> 04:46:59.558 align:start position:0%
record is uh Cella have a membership
 
04:47:03.030 --> 04:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
with Bia so they pay dues to you I
 
04:47:05.150 --> 04:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
believe that's the case Okay as well as
 
04:47:07.390 --> 04:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
Waste Management I believe that's the
 
04:47:10.190 --> 04:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
case Okay um we have that all online by
 
04:47:12.590 --> 04:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
the way it's on our side under our our
 
04:47:14.190 --> 04:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
just I'd love it for everybody to know
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
for the record um also
 
04:47:22.548 --> 04:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
how how are costs going to go up when we
 
04:47:25.948 --> 04:47:25.958 align:start position:0%
right now have more than 50% capacity
 
04:47:28.070 --> 04:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's available for New Hampshire how
 
04:47:30.030 --> 04:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
are costs going up if we actually are
 
04:47:32.230 --> 04:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
putting New Hampshire TR first which by
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
the way is in every permit are you
 
04:47:35.430 --> 04:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with that that they have to
 
04:47:36.788 --> 04:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
take New Hampshire New Hampshire has to
 
04:47:38.868 --> 04:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
be the number one priority are you
 
04:47:41.670 --> 04:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with that I'm
 
04:47:43.628 --> 04:47:43.638 align:start position:0%
famar with the basic outlines of the
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
permitting process I don't have an
 
04:47:46.830 --> 04:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
in-depth knowledge of
 
04:47:49.270 --> 04:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
that so where is the costs going to go
 
04:47:50.788 --> 04:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
up I don't understand it's kind of like
 
04:47:52.628 --> 04:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
you have a circular argument and it's
 
04:47:54.990 --> 04:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
not resonating with me how are costs
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
going to go up when we wouldn't have to
 
04:47:59.788 --> 04:47:59.798 align:start position:0%
send any of our trash out we have more
 
04:48:02.788 --> 04:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
than 50% of capacity that's available
 
04:48:04.990 --> 04:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
designated to New Hampshire so tell me
 
04:48:06.788 --> 04:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
how costs are going up and the sky is
 
04:48:08.230 --> 04:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
going to fall and you keep saying the
 
04:48:12.470 --> 04:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
word ban this isn't a ban this is a till
 
04:48:15.670 --> 04:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
2030 so I want to go back to an earlier
 
04:48:17.910 --> 04:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
question you asked a prior witness uh
 
04:48:20.350 --> 04:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
where you pointed out that I believe it
 
04:48:23.548 --> 04:48:23.558 align:start position:0%
was one of the facilities um were
 
04:48:25.350 --> 04:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
considering would be considering
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
application for expansion in 2028 or
 
04:48:31.628 --> 04:48:31.638 align:start position:0%
2029 uh which is and
 
04:48:34.270 --> 04:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
their if I understood correctly their
 
04:48:37.868 --> 04:48:37.878 align:start position:0%
current uh allowed uh their current
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
permit goes to 2034 which is a year
 
04:48:44.470 --> 04:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
period so the concern isn't
 
04:48:47.190 --> 04:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily that there's
 
04:48:51.590 --> 04:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
um a the concern is that because it
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
takes time um to go through the pering
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
process approximately six years if I did
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
that math correctly um for an expansion
 
04:49:02.788 --> 04:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
I assume that a new landfill would take
 
04:49:06.310 --> 04:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
longer than that um but because it takes
 
04:49:09.948 --> 04:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
such a long period of time um if you
 
04:49:12.030 --> 04:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
have a pause C
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
for the length of time that this bill
 
04:49:19.470 --> 04:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
proposes you end up in a situation where
 
04:49:22.750 --> 04:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
the max intake that the currently that
 
04:49:27.270 --> 04:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
the existing landfills can take is
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
exceeded by the uh actual volume of land
 
04:49:34.390 --> 04:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
fillable materials generated in the
 
04:49:37.548 --> 04:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and so the
 
04:49:40.110 --> 04:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
question is what happens with that extra
 
04:49:42.350 --> 04:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
and who pays for that and so that's
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
where I'm getting the cost argument is
 
04:49:46.110 --> 04:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
well if the extra ends up having to get
 
04:49:50.470 --> 04:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
shipped again I'm just I'm just uh you
 
04:49:52.910 --> 04:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
know making it hard for people in Ohio
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
if it has to get shipped to Ohio you
 
04:49:59.110 --> 04:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
know that cost of shipment is probably
 
04:50:01.548 --> 04:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
going to be higher whether that's via
 
04:50:03.510 --> 04:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
truck whether that's via train than it
 
04:50:07.150 --> 04:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
is to go to someplace closer
 
04:50:10.708 --> 04:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
um again it it depends on exactly what
 
04:50:12.430 --> 04:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
happens in the regulatory structure but
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm where I'm basing my
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
cost argument if that's helpful
 
04:50:20.948 --> 04:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
representative okay representative Bixby
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question so
 
04:50:28.470 --> 04:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
um as a as a member of the New Hampshire
 
04:50:31.310 --> 04:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh legislature it is my job to look out
 
04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
for residents of New Hampshire and
 
04:50:36.190 --> 04:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire not
 
04:50:37.948 --> 04:50:37.958 align:start position:0%
businesses in Massachusetts or
 
04:50:41.350 --> 04:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
Connecticut or Vermont and
 
04:50:44.270 --> 04:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
the way that our
 
04:50:47.070 --> 04:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
um that our statue is written in terms
 
04:50:51.310 --> 04:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
of landfill capacity New Hampshire trash
 
04:50:56.110 --> 04:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
has priority at the landfill uh at
 
04:51:00.110 --> 04:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
and uh waste management is required to
 
04:51:03.628 --> 04:51:03.638 align:start position:0%
have uh that capacity through 2034 at
 
04:51:06.628 --> 04:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
TurnKey Mount carbury is required to
 
04:51:08.430 --> 04:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
have that capacity through
 
04:51:11.670 --> 04:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
2040 if it looks like they won't be able
 
04:51:15.670 --> 04:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
to meet that capacity for New Hampshire
 
04:51:18.030 --> 04:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
trash they have to take less out of
 
04:51:18.040 --> 04:51:19.190 align:start position:0%
trash they have to take less out of
state

04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
trash why should I as someone who's
 
04:51:23.310 --> 04:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
watching out for New Hampshire
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
businesses and New Hampshire res
 
04:51:29.868 --> 04:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
residents care if a Massachusetts
 
04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
business or Massachusetts residents have
 
04:51:36.310 --> 04:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
to send their trash to Ohio I don't see
 
04:51:38.470 --> 04:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
how how is that a benefit for New
 
04:51:40.990 --> 04:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to watch out for the people of
 
04:51:44.110 --> 04:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:45.750 --> 04:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts well thank you for the
 
04:51:47.910 --> 04:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
question representative Bixby um just to
 
04:51:50.430 --> 04:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
be clear my testimony is limited to
 
04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
businesses operating in New Hampshire
 
04:51:53.548 --> 04:51:53.558 align:start position:0%
that's who I represent I don't represent
 
04:51:56.230 --> 04:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
businesses in Massachusetts whether or
 
04:51:58.110 --> 04:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
not they have to ship their trash
 
04:52:00.390 --> 04:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere else is totally irrelevant to
 
04:52:03.510 --> 04:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm paid to care about um and I
 
04:52:06.510 --> 04:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
would assume that as a representative uh
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the legislature that you represent
 
04:52:08.160 --> 04:52:08.948 align:start position:0%
in the legislature that you represent
your

04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:52:11.670 --> 04:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
constituents thank you representative H
 
04:52:15.270 --> 04:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair I'm sure
 
04:52:17.230 --> 04:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
that you've heard a lot of the testimony
 
04:52:20.110 --> 04:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
today would you agree that um there are
 
04:52:22.510 --> 04:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been raised about a
 
04:52:25.390 --> 04:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
variety of issues for our landfills for
 
04:52:25.400 --> 04:52:26.390 align:start position:0%
variety of issues for our landfills for
our

04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:52:29.708 --> 04:52:29.718 align:start position:0%
waterways um whether we're accepting
 
04:52:32.510 --> 04:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
materials that the states around us
 
04:52:36.030 --> 04:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
don't accept where the p is coming from
 
04:52:41.548 --> 04:52:41.558 align:start position:0%
where it's going do you think that a
 
04:52:44.910 --> 04:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
to consider some of these very important
 
04:52:51.430 --> 04:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:53.990 --> 04:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
unreasonable well let me frame it this
 
04:52:57.470 --> 04:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
way we've had numerous study committees
 
04:53:00.310 --> 04:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
as we've heard today over the past more
 
04:53:02.830 --> 04:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
than a decade um we've had the solid
 
04:53:04.390 --> 04:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
waste working group working on this
 
04:53:06.430 --> 04:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
problem and we haven't come up with a
 
04:53:09.270 --> 04:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
solution yet I don't believe that a
 
04:53:12.948 --> 04:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
pause is going to result in a solution
 
04:53:15.830 --> 04:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
um it's just going to uh limit our
 
04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
options going forward followup
 
04:53:23.548 --> 04:53:23.558 align:start position:0%
followup are you aware that um a permit
 
04:53:27.670 --> 04:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
is has already been worked up for the
 
04:53:30.788 --> 04:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
past six years and and this pause would
 
04:53:34.868 --> 04:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
not keep that permit um it would not
 
04:53:36.670 --> 04:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
require that permit to start from
 
04:53:38.990 --> 04:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
scratch an awful lot of work has been
 
04:53:42.230 --> 04:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
done and
 
04:53:44.990 --> 04:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
overall I'm hearing about shipping trash
 
04:53:47.948 --> 04:53:47.958 align:start position:0%
to Ohio New Hampshire doesn't have a
 
04:53:51.030 --> 04:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
capacity problem that has been
 
04:53:53.150 --> 04:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrated through all the meetings
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
that I've participated in so we have to
 
04:53:58.110 --> 04:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
get some of these red herrings off the
 
04:54:01.030 --> 04:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
table we need the pause because we've
 
04:54:03.470 --> 04:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
got issues that haven't been resolved
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
not that we haven't been working on them
 
04:54:08.230 --> 04:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
but we haven't gotten to the point we
 
04:54:11.830 --> 04:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
need to be in order to be secure that we
 
04:54:15.510 --> 04:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
can safely take New Hampshire's trash
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
and not the surrounding states who are
 
04:54:22.390 --> 04:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
sending the materials that are toxic to
 
04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
residents I don't know if there was a
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
question in there thank you for the
 
04:54:29.310 --> 04:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
question I I am aware of kind of the
 
04:54:32.430 --> 04:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
grandfathering process with permitting
 
04:54:36.190 --> 04:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions seeing
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much for your
 
04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
testimony this afternoon and I call

were planning on saying um please
 
04:55:00.830 --> 04:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:03.190 --> 04:55:03.200 align:start position:0%

Wayne Morrison and I am president of an
 
04:55:15.708 --> 04:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
organization called North Country
 
04:55:18.070 --> 04:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
Alliance for balance speak closer to the
 
04:55:21.230 --> 04:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um I want to start my
 
04:55:24.708 --> 04:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
testimony uh cheer Aaron and uh
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
representative Jama and all of you I
 
04:55:29.510 --> 04:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
want to thank you we've been at this for
 
04:55:31.270 --> 04:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
six years and this is the most
 
04:55:34.510 --> 04:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
constructive detailed meaningful
 
04:55:37.150 --> 04:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
conversation I have heard at any point
 
04:55:38.750 --> 04:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
about the solid waste problems in the
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so I I applaud
 
04:55:43.868 --> 04:55:43.878 align:start position:0%
you for your willingness to weit into
 
04:55:46.708 --> 04:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
what is a complicated and sometimes
 
04:55:50.270 --> 04:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
controversial issue and uh I am more
 
04:55:52.868 --> 04:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
optimistic now than ever before in part
 
04:55:54.948 --> 04:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
because this body has been willing to
 
04:55:57.150 --> 04:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
wait in and try and make a
 
04:55:59.670 --> 04:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
difference um I have testimony that I'm
 
04:56:01.390 --> 04:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
sending around I won't read
 
04:56:04.670 --> 04:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
it but I would like to highlight a few
 
04:56:07.070 --> 04:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
points at various points this morning we
 
04:56:10.390 --> 04:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
talked about um things like uh how much
 
04:56:13.150 --> 04:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
waste is generated in the state of New
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh representative ktoa
 
04:56:17.590 --> 04:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned and I know there's an inti
 
04:56:19.948 --> 04:56:19.958 align:start position:0%
there's a big housing uh problem and
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do something about it
 
04:56:25.150 --> 04:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
but in a reality check would be the
 
04:56:27.030 --> 04:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire's population has
 
04:56:29.590 --> 04:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
been relatively flat for the last eight
 
04:56:32.150 --> 04:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
years the amount of trash we generate in
 
04:56:35.310 --> 04:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
the state is roughly a million tons it's
 
04:56:36.830 --> 04:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit more a little bit
 
04:56:39.350 --> 04:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
less but you you you can hear all kinds
 
04:56:41.070 --> 04:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
of things about a crisis Isis in the
 
04:56:43.110 --> 04:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire around trash it
 
04:56:44.788 --> 04:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely is not the
 
04:56:47.350 --> 04:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
case in fact if you were in business and
 
04:56:49.430 --> 04:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
you had this kind of a flat
 
04:56:51.670 --> 04:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
demand situation you would feel
 
04:56:53.390 --> 04:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly you you would have an
 
04:56:55.350 --> 04:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly efficient process to handle
 
04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
it because you can pretty much guarantee
 
04:56:59.430 --> 04:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
how much you're going to see every year
 
04:57:01.750 --> 04:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
the wild card is unfortunately we take
 
04:57:04.548 --> 04:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
in almost the same amount from out of
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
state and to my recollection and to in
 
04:57:10.350 --> 04:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
our review that amount of trash is going
 
04:57:13.868 --> 04:57:13.878 align:start position:0%
to go up the conversation about Ohio has
 
04:57:16.230 --> 04:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with New Hampshire by the
 
04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
way Massachusetts doesn't just send us
 
04:57:21.070 --> 04:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
their trash they send their trash on
 
04:57:25.270 --> 04:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
railroad cars to Ohio to Pennsylvania to
 
04:57:28.350 --> 04:57:28.360 align:start position:0%
South uh Carolina uh they they've made a
 
04:57:30.830 --> 04:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
decision the literally the train has
 
04:57:32.788 --> 04:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
left the station in Massachusetts they
 
04:57:35.350 --> 04:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
have decided rather than deal with that
 
04:57:36.708 --> 04:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
problem they'll they'll make it somebody
 
04:57:38.390 --> 04:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
else's problem and because we're a
 
04:57:40.708 --> 04:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
neighboring state and because we haven't
 
04:57:43.830 --> 04:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
acted sooner we're a magnet for
 
04:57:47.788 --> 04:57:47.798 align:start position:0%
it and what I've heard that today is the
 
04:57:51.110 --> 04:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
the I heard words today that we echoed
 
04:57:52.670 --> 04:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
three and four years ago and I can't
 
04:57:54.390 --> 04:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
tell you how rewarding it is to finally
 
04:57:56.548 --> 04:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
hear representatives of the people
 
04:57:58.708 --> 04:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
starting to see the same issues that we
 
04:57:58.718 --> 04:57:59.548 align:start position:0%
starting to see the same issues that we
have

04:57:59.548 --> 04:57:59.558 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:58:01.868 --> 04:58:01.878 align:start position:0%
seen I also want to talk a little bit
 
04:58:03.510 --> 04:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
about the solid waste
 
04:58:07.670 --> 04:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
plan Karen eel is a hero to me she went
 
04:58:10.190 --> 04:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
into a she took on a very complicated
 
04:58:12.990 --> 04:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
ated task with a committee that was made
 
04:58:15.030 --> 04:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
up mainly with people in Industry who
 
04:58:16.910 --> 04:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
have a financial interest in fighting
 
04:58:19.708 --> 04:58:19.718 align:start position:0%
any progress on this subject and she has
 
04:58:21.830 --> 04:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
been able to make
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
progress that plan the overarching goal
 
04:58:27.750 --> 04:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
of that plan that was handed down by the
 
04:58:29.948 --> 04:58:29.958 align:start position:0%
legislature was to set an aggressive
 
04:58:32.190 --> 04:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
goal you've heard the number 25%
 
04:58:33.910 --> 04:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
reduction by
 
04:58:38.430 --> 04:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
2030 what that means in real waste is
 
04:58:41.590 --> 04:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
375,000 tons if we were able to deliver
 
04:58:44.990 --> 04:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
it that's the equivalent of eliminating
 
04:58:47.110 --> 04:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
almost every any landfill in the state
 
04:58:49.190 --> 04:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
except the waste management one and
 
04:58:51.628 --> 04:58:51.638 align:start position:0%
TurnKey that's how much trash that is
 
04:58:53.590 --> 04:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
that would eliminate the need for one
 
04:58:58.030 --> 04:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
landfill if we ever hit the 45% by 2050
 
04:59:01.868 --> 04:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
that's 675,000 tons it's an enormous you
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
know that's that's what we should be
 
04:59:03.120 --> 04:59:04.030 align:start position:0%
know that's that's what we should be
aiming

04:59:04.030 --> 04:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
aiming
 
04:59:07.350 --> 04:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
at and the reason that's important
 
04:59:10.190 --> 04:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
is that plan was developed less than two
 
04:59:10.200 --> 04:59:11.990 align:start position:0%
is that plan was developed less than two
years

04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:59:16.670 --> 04:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
ago why on Earth would we not let that
 
04:59:18.948 --> 04:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
team that's done good work we're just
 
04:59:21.150 --> 04:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
starting the composting initiative is
 
04:59:21.160 --> 04:59:23.110 align:start position:0%
starting the composting initiative is
just

04:59:23.110 --> 04:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
starting why would we ever issue a new
 
04:59:27.548 --> 04:59:27.558 align:start position:0%
permit for a new landfill and
 
04:59:29.230 --> 04:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
institutionalize the same thing that
 
04:59:30.548 --> 04:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
04:59:33.510 --> 04:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
stop I haven't spoken to anybody in in
 
04:59:36.390 --> 04:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature or in the public I I
 
04:59:38.070 --> 04:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
grew up in Massachusetts I have friends
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts nobody thinks what
 
04:59:43.750 --> 04:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing makes any sense all we need
 
04:59:45.708 --> 04:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
is the backbone and the willingness to
 
04:59:48.788 --> 04:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
wait in and do something about it we
 
04:59:50.230 --> 04:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
keep hearing about the interstate
 
04:59:50.240 --> 04:59:51.510 align:start position:0%
keep hearing about the interstate
commerce

04:59:51.510 --> 04:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
04:59:55.030 --> 04:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
clots that is an obstacle it's not the
 
04:59:57.310 --> 04:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
end of the story other states have
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
figured out how to get around it we do
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
not have to hire private companies to
 
05:00:03.750 --> 05:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
run our
 
05:00:06.548 --> 05:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
landfills and our goal should be I I
 
05:00:10.110 --> 05:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
believe our goal should really be uh if
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
we're successful to push out as far as
 
05:00:15.190 --> 05:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
possible ever having to have another
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
landfill in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:00:20.670 --> 05:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
and that's doable it's not a pipe dream
 
05:00:22.990 --> 05:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
it's not some tree hugger telling you
 
05:00:25.390 --> 05:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
something that we can't live with we can
 
05:00:28.510 --> 05:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
do that but rather than pouring
 
05:00:30.190 --> 05:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure money into private
 
05:00:32.708 --> 05:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
companies who get rich and who threaten
 
05:00:35.070 --> 05:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
our environment we should be putting it
 
05:00:37.788 --> 05:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
into composting and and
 
05:00:40.548 --> 05:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
Recycling and we should be working back
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:00:43.708 --> 05:00:43.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturers I don't know I don't know
 
05:00:45.350 --> 05:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
about you but when you go to McDonald's
 
05:00:49.030 --> 05:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
or you go to Dunkin Donuts and you order
 
05:00:51.990 --> 05:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
something you get a plastic Cup 14
 
05:00:54.750 --> 05:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
spoons a bunch of napkins you walk four
 
05:00:56.948 --> 05:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
feet and you throw it in the trash and
 
05:00:59.470 --> 05:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
guess where that goes that goes to a
 
05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
landfill so I I I'm encouraged by where
 
05:01:02.638 --> 05:01:03.310 align:start position:0%
landfill so I I I'm encouraged by where
we

05:01:03.310 --> 05:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:01:06.190 --> 05:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
are the the absolute elephant in the
 
05:01:08.548 --> 05:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
room in any of these conversations is
 
05:01:11.470 --> 05:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
out of state waste it dwarfs anything
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
else we do if we want to meet that Solid
 
05:01:16.470 --> 05:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
Waste plan there's two things we got to
 
05:01:19.628 --> 05:01:19.638 align:start position:0%
do take the food waste out and and scale
 
05:01:21.470 --> 05:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
our composting
 
05:01:23.948 --> 05:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
capability and I'm not saying eliminate
 
05:01:26.830 --> 05:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
out of state waste but why can't we cut
 
05:01:27.910 --> 05:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
it in
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
half and one way to do that is don't
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
license a new permit to a private
 
05:01:35.150 --> 05:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
operator who is on record to say that
 
05:01:36.990 --> 05:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
50% of that waste is going to come from
 
05:01:37.948 --> 05:01:37.958 align:start position:0%
out of
 
05:01:41.390 --> 05:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
state it makes no sense
 
05:01:43.470 --> 05:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
Governor aot went to our little Lake in
 
05:01:46.350 --> 05:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
the northern part of this state and in 5
 
05:01:49.390 --> 05:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
minutes took a selfie and she said this
 
05:01:52.548 --> 05:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
she looked around and said this makes no
 
05:01:55.230 --> 05:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
sense and to her to her credit she stood
 
05:01:57.190 --> 05:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
up and doubled down during her
 
05:02:00.110 --> 05:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
inauguration speech and said there will
 
05:02:03.150 --> 05:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
be no landfill at Forest
 
05:02:05.910 --> 05:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
Lake it's a beautiful
 
05:02:07.948 --> 05:02:07.958 align:start position:0%
place and we're not going to let it
 
05:02:12.310 --> 05:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
in order for that to really happen we
 
05:02:17.230 --> 05:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
need our legislators to be bold and be
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
courageous and stand up to the interests
 
05:02:22.270 --> 05:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
of industry and do the right thing for
 
05:02:24.708 --> 05:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire this is an
 
05:02:26.548 --> 05:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
issue that's been going on for far too
 
05:02:29.788 --> 05:02:29.798 align:start position:0%
long and it's not okay to just just punt
 
05:02:32.230 --> 05:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
it down the the road we have a great
 
05:02:34.510 --> 05:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity the moratorium is is a
 
05:02:36.150 --> 05:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
perfect opportunity to fix a bunch of
 
05:02:37.150 --> 05:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
things that are
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
broken and I think that's out of state
 
05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
ways I think that's leate that we talked
 
05:02:46.548 --> 05:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
about earlier today I think it's Pas and
 
05:02:48.990 --> 05:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's around our site selection
 
05:02:51.868 --> 05:02:51.878 align:start position:0%
process we have a bunch of things people
 
05:02:54.350 --> 05:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
are working hard the de Dees is doing
 
05:02:56.470 --> 05:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
everything they can but they're limited
 
05:02:58.990 --> 05:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
and they need your help this is a policy
 
05:03:02.070 --> 05:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
decision and if we can only stand up and
 
05:03:04.510 --> 05:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
say what we're doing isn't working we
 
05:03:06.190 --> 05:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
need to go in another Direction let's
 
05:03:09.430 --> 05:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
take a pause and let's fix this let's
 
05:03:11.868 --> 05:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
not be The Whipping Boy for
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts any longer thank you any

okay I am here to share my story and to
 
05:03:55.868 --> 05:03:55.878 align:start position:0%
advocate for Forest Lake Bethlehem has
 
05:03:58.510 --> 05:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
saved my life I came up from
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts where I lived in a toxic
 
05:04:03.750 --> 05:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
luxury apartment complex and I got very
 
05:04:06.548 --> 05:04:06.558 align:start position:0%
very sick from gases there that
 
05:04:09.590 --> 05:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
were um produced a lot from the leachate
 
05:04:12.430 --> 05:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
that that happened from the land that
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
was contaminated that wasn't being
 
05:04:18.910 --> 05:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
supervised and what happened was um what
 
05:04:20.830 --> 05:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you I wrote my little notes
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
here um I'm asking you to support this
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill in the temporary moratorium while
 
05:04:28.030 --> 05:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
proper supervision regulation and
 
05:04:29.830 --> 05:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement is
 
05:04:32.310 --> 05:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
established I moved up to New Hampshire
 
05:04:34.708 --> 05:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts Live Free or Die is
 
05:04:37.590 --> 05:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
no joke my former luxury apartment
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
complex was built on contaminated land
 
05:04:42.548 --> 05:04:42.558 align:start position:0%
and tested by sandborn head who
 
05:04:45.270 --> 05:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
concluded an exemption to not report
 
05:04:48.350 --> 05:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
concentrations of hazardous chemicals
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
including Le
 
05:04:53.110 --> 05:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
arsonate at that time there was no
 
05:04:55.868 --> 05:04:55.878 align:start position:0%
significant risk defined by the mCP to
 
05:04:59.350 --> 05:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
no fault of sandborn heads I'm also
 
05:05:02.110 --> 05:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
speaking to advocate for them and the
 
05:05:04.628 --> 05:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
corporations because of the negligence
 
05:05:07.628 --> 05:05:07.638 align:start position:0%
and the lack of inspections is going to
 
05:05:09.990 --> 05:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
tarnish their good name their hard work
 
05:05:11.990 --> 05:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
and dedication trying to figure out how
 
05:05:16.270 --> 05:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:18.270 --> 05:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
waste at that time there's no
 
05:05:21.070 --> 05:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
significant risk because there was no
 
05:05:23.990 --> 05:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
development in comes the property the
 
05:05:25.390 --> 05:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
luxury apartment
 
05:05:29.070 --> 05:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
complex that began to suffer corrosion
 
05:05:32.230 --> 05:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
from being built on the lead arsonate so
 
05:05:34.708 --> 05:05:34.718 align:start position:0%
all the pipes all the wiring inside the
 
05:05:39.190 --> 05:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
building inside the walls are corroding
 
05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
and producing very toxic
 
05:05:45.510 --> 05:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
gases which is not inspected because
 
05:05:47.470 --> 05:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
nobody's claiming responsibility for
 
05:05:50.708 --> 05:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
these properties I shouldn't say these
 
05:05:52.548 --> 05:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
this one particular property is all I
 
05:05:54.430 --> 05:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
know for
 
05:05:58.270 --> 05:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
sure it's an orphan building and no
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
plumbing inspection nobody knows whose
 
05:06:02.590 --> 05:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction it
 
05:06:04.948 --> 05:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
is and there's no supervision or
 
05:06:04.958 --> 05:06:06.670 align:start position:0%
is and there's no supervision or
regulation

05:06:06.670 --> 05:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
05:06:10.830 --> 05:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
so what happens is there's plenty of
 
05:06:13.270 --> 05:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
water intrusion the sprinkler system is
 
05:06:15.150 --> 05:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
corroded so there's water pouring
 
05:06:17.628 --> 05:06:17.638 align:start position:0%
through the ceilings the last year I was
 
05:06:20.190 --> 05:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
there I had 15 leaks in one year I had
 
05:06:22.830 --> 05:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
leaks all six years that I was there so
 
05:06:25.310 --> 05:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
this contaminated water is recycling
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
inside of the building breaking down
 
05:06:30.910 --> 05:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
HVAC systems leaking all over the rugs
 
05:06:32.830 --> 05:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
so when I heard him say
 
05:06:35.470 --> 05:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
rugs it put a little light bulb off in
 
05:06:38.150 --> 05:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
my head like those rugs are going into
 
05:06:41.670 --> 05:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
the dumpsters that are laed with
 
05:06:44.590 --> 05:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
cassella and we're also downhill from a
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
super fun site where there's no drainage
 
05:06:50.470 --> 05:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
on the property because it's saturated
 
05:06:53.190 --> 05:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
in oil so when the water does finally
 
05:06:56.590 --> 05:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
subside you can see over by the
 
05:06:58.670 --> 05:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
playground there's a white residue
 
05:07:01.750 --> 05:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's left on the
 
05:07:05.788 --> 05:07:05.798 align:start position:0%
grass so I can't say for sure where all
 
05:07:08.750 --> 05:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
of this trash is going but I do know
 
05:07:10.230 --> 05:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
that there are Cassel the dumpsters
 
05:07:13.628 --> 05:07:13.638 align:start position:0%
there and I do see maintenance putting a
 
05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
lot of items in there that are
 
05:07:19.390 --> 05:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
questionable I used to be um a special
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
ed science teacher so I know a little
 
05:07:23.948 --> 05:07:23.958 align:start position:0%
bit about chemicals and gases I became
 
05:07:28.110 --> 05:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
too sick and my cognitive ability is out
 
05:07:30.788 --> 05:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
the window to be able to teach
 
05:07:33.230 --> 05:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
again it's a miracle I can speak right
 
05:07:36.670 --> 05:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
now I was having seizures and Comas in
 
05:07:36.680 --> 05:07:37.910 align:start position:0%
now I was having seizures and Comas in
my

05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:07:40.590 --> 05:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
apartment so what I'm asking you again
 
05:07:44.390 --> 05:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
is to consider seriously consider a
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
temporary moratorium again it's also for
 
05:07:50.110 --> 05:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
the corporations who did their best they
 
05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
found an exemption that's their business
 
05:07:53.948 --> 05:07:53.958 align:start position:0%
that's what they're doing it's okay
 
05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong with it that's
 
05:07:58.190 --> 05:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
what they did there was no followup
 
05:08:00.310 --> 05:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
there was no supervision there's no
 
05:08:02.788 --> 05:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement there's no checking the
 
05:08:04.548 --> 05:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
building commissioner's
 
05:08:06.830 --> 05:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
license there's no one checking up on
 
05:08:09.670 --> 05:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
the fire department
 
05:08:12.548 --> 05:08:12.558 align:start position:0%
which is not to their fault they're all
 
05:08:14.070 --> 05:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
their hands are tied behind their back
 
05:08:16.910 --> 05:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
and nobody can do anything it's out of
 
05:08:20.670 --> 05:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
hand so if we have a moratorium and a
 
05:08:22.670 --> 05:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more time and some more talk
 
05:08:25.510 --> 05:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
around the table to say how can we help
 
05:08:27.430 --> 05:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
everybody and how can we bring Justice
 
05:08:30.350 --> 05:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
for everybody all around from T tenants
 
05:08:34.110 --> 05:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
residences and maybe things like streams
 
05:08:35.830 --> 05:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
that are public water supplies that are
 
05:08:38.070 --> 05:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
behind luxury apartment complexes like
 
05:08:40.430 --> 05:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
this that are are contaminating our
 
05:08:43.868 --> 05:08:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:46.510 --> 05:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
children we just need to talk about it
 
05:08:49.030 --> 05:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
we need to get the word out and we all
 
05:08:52.190 --> 05:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
need to communicate what we have here is
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
a problem of
 
05:08:55.590 --> 05:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
communication and everybody's at
 
05:08:58.510 --> 05:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
different levels of
 
05:08:58.520 --> 05:09:02.590 align:start position:0%
different levels of
understanding

05:09:02.590 --> 05:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:05.670 --> 05:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
um I think that's all I again I want to
 
05:09:07.868 --> 05:09:07.878 align:start position:0%
say I am speaking for the people but
 
05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
also for the corporations and the
 
05:09:11.470 --> 05:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
businesses to keep their good name
 
05:09:13.270 --> 05:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
polished thank you very much for your
 
05:09:15.230 --> 05:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
testimony any
 
05:09:18.470 --> 05:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you thank you

for your service and uh I only have one
 
05:09:23.628 --> 05:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
last pin card that's uh director whims
 
05:09:33.070 --> 05:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:33.080 --> 05:09:34.868 align:start position:0%
 
Dees

05:09:34.868 --> 05:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
Dees
 
05:09:37.430 --> 05:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon Madame chair and
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
05:09:40.948 --> 05:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
record my name is Mike winsat I serve as
 
05:09:42.270 --> 05:09:42.280 align:start position:0%
director of the waste management
 
05:09:46.150 --> 05:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
division for New Hampshire Dees and uh
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
um the agency is not taking position on
 
05:09:50.910 --> 05:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
this bill um as we often do we we do
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
review the bill and uh if we identify
 
05:09:55.990 --> 05:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
any concerns or observations we we try
 
05:09:57.390 --> 05:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
to share those with the committee if we
 
05:09:58.510 --> 05:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
think they're important for the
 
05:10:00.430 --> 05:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
committee to know about so there are a
 
05:10:02.788 --> 05:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
handful of things I'd like to review uh
 
05:10:04.670 --> 05:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
largely technical issues that you know I
 
05:10:08.110 --> 05:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
think might have an an inadvertent or
 
05:10:10.030 --> 05:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
not work the way that the sponsor may
 
05:10:10.040 --> 05:10:10.788 align:start position:0%
not work the way that the sponsor may
have

05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:10:12.868 --> 05:10:12.878 align:start position:0%
intended and the first one I'll just go
 
05:10:14.190 --> 05:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
through the bill it's a pretty short
 
05:10:16.470 --> 05:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
bill on lines five and six where it
 
05:10:19.590 --> 05:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
talks about um Department accepting
 
05:10:22.030 --> 05:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
applications but not um being prohibited
 
05:10:26.110 --> 05:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
from evaluating or processing them um a
 
05:10:28.070 --> 05:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
technicality here is that under current
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
law if um the agency accepts an
 
05:10:34.990 --> 05:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
application and does not act on it and
 
05:10:36.868 --> 05:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
and render a decision within a certain
 
05:10:40.150 --> 05:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
number of days then under RSA 54 31
 
05:10:43.990 --> 05:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
a29 the application is deemed approved
 
05:10:45.590 --> 05:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that was the sponsor's
 
05:10:48.190 --> 05:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
intention here so perhaps a way to
 
05:10:51.430 --> 05:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
address that would be either to um tell
 
05:10:53.310 --> 05:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
the agency it has to deny an application
 
05:10:56.708 --> 05:10:56.718 align:start position:0%
during this period um or um it could say
 
05:10:59.470 --> 05:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
something like notwithstanding RSA 541
 
05:11:03.548 --> 05:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
a29 you know and then talk about us not
 
05:11:05.470 --> 05:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
us being the agency being prohibited
 
05:11:07.510 --> 05:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
from processing the application so I
 
05:11:10.470 --> 05:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point that out um um and
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
then on uh line six again that's that
 
05:11:17.230 --> 05:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
same provision there um with the
 
05:11:18.788 --> 05:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
prohibition if the committee is
 
05:11:21.470 --> 05:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
interested in addressing some of the
 
05:11:23.390 --> 05:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
concerns have been raised about you know
 
05:11:26.868 --> 05:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
a delay in reviewing applications may be
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
potentially causing a capacity problem
 
05:11:32.270 --> 05:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
then I think that possibly the bill
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
could instead say something like um the
 
05:11:37.150 --> 05:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
agency can still process the application
 
05:11:40.910 --> 05:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
they can engage with the applic to do
 
05:11:42.750 --> 05:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
some review for completeness and
 
05:11:44.948 --> 05:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
determine whether you know at least
 
05:11:47.310 --> 05:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
there's enough information there to to
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
to process the application during that
 
05:11:51.510 --> 05:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
moratorium period so that when the
 
05:11:54.270 --> 05:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
moratorium expires it won't be like
 
05:11:56.590 --> 05:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
starting from the beginning because as
 
05:11:59.910 --> 05:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
as I read the language now we can accept
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
an application but we can't even really
 
05:12:04.868 --> 05:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
review it or process it in any fashion
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
and so again that's maybe more of a
 
05:12:08.788 --> 05:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
technicality than a than anything else
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
but I want
 
05:12:11.470 --> 05:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
we thought it was important to raise
 
05:12:17.190 --> 05:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
that um also on lines seven and eight
 
05:12:19.548 --> 05:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
um and there's been some testimony about
 
05:12:21.670 --> 05:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
this it seems to anticipate that
 
05:12:23.548 --> 05:12:23.558 align:start position:0%
potentially new regulations or new
 
05:12:25.230 --> 05:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
technologies may come along during this
 
05:12:28.350 --> 05:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
moratorium period but as I as we read it
 
05:12:30.708 --> 05:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't provide for that
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily it assumes that those things
 
05:12:34.948 --> 05:12:34.958 align:start position:0%
are going to happen I guess pursuant to
 
05:12:37.150 --> 05:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
other legislation or what have you and
 
05:12:40.070 --> 05:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
it occurs that the concern would be and
 
05:12:42.150 --> 05:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this is really a concern
 
05:12:44.590 --> 05:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
that's realistic but if if just this
 
05:12:46.270 --> 05:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass and then nothing
 
05:12:47.910 --> 05:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
happened for during that moratorium
 
05:12:50.030 --> 05:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
period we would then have an application
 
05:12:52.470 --> 05:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
or we could then receive applications
 
05:12:54.788 --> 05:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
again and review them under the very
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
same regime that we have right now and I
 
05:12:58.390 --> 05:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the the intent of the
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor so one thought about that would
 
05:13:02.830 --> 05:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
be either to include in this bill some
 
05:13:05.670 --> 05:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
provision for making policy changes
 
05:13:08.510 --> 05:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
or including Provisions like this
 
05:13:11.110 --> 05:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
moratorium in another build that seeks
 
05:13:14.270 --> 05:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
to make changes to to the the regulatory
 
05:13:16.590 --> 05:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
framework so that's just an
 
05:13:19.310 --> 05:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
observation and and then on lines 9
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
through 12 um where it talks about
 
05:13:26.670 --> 05:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
um the the nothing that that the that
 
05:13:29.110 --> 05:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
the moratorium doesn't apply to
 
05:13:31.350 --> 05:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
expansions there's a technical problem
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
there because it talks about um uh fully
 
05:13:37.670 --> 05:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
permitted facilities you know it
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't prohibit us from processing
 
05:13:41.548 --> 05:13:41.558 align:start position:0%
facilities have already been fully
 
05:13:43.788 --> 05:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
permitted um for an expansion but the
 
05:13:45.470 --> 05:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
reality is because we administer the
 
05:13:48.910 --> 05:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
program through a system of permits um
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
any expansion that may we we may have we
 
05:13:54.310 --> 05:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
may have already approved an expansion
 
05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
but it's not fully permitted because it
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
has to go through design review and
 
05:14:00.628 --> 05:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
construction approval operating approval
 
05:14:02.788 --> 05:14:02.798 align:start position:0%
so a technicality in reading that you
 
05:14:04.548 --> 05:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
could say well your expansion was
 
05:14:06.190 --> 05:14:06.200 align:start position:0%
approved but it wasn't actually fully
 
05:14:08.110 --> 05:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
permitted so you can't build it I'm not
 
05:14:10.350 --> 05:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
sure that again is what is intended by
 
05:14:12.590 --> 05:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
the legislation so I raised that as a
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
potential technical problem and then
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
um I guess the next last of all um on
 
05:14:23.590 --> 05:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
line 15 of the bill where it makes
 
05:14:25.590 --> 05:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
reference to
 
05:14:28.110 --> 05:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
um uh Public Utilities or rather
 
05:14:30.270 --> 05:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
perennial water bodies transversing
 
05:14:32.430 --> 05:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
traversing of per of the footprint of
 
05:14:35.670 --> 05:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
the landfill I'm not really sure how or
 
05:14:37.990 --> 05:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
where a perennial water body would be
 
05:14:39.390 --> 05:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
traversing the footprint print ofal
 
05:14:41.708 --> 05:14:41.718 align:start position:0%
landfill so I'm not I we wouldn't be
 
05:14:43.150 --> 05:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
permitting something like that so I'm
 
05:14:44.708 --> 05:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
not sure I'm not really sure where
 
05:14:46.990 --> 05:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
that's going and I I I don't have a
 
05:14:48.190 --> 05:14:48.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion for how to fix it because I'm
 
05:14:50.070 --> 05:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
not really sure why it's there so I just
 
05:14:51.190 --> 05:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise that because we're not
 
05:14:53.590 --> 05:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
really understanding what that is and
 
05:14:55.070 --> 05:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
with that I'm I'm happy to take any
 
05:14:57.548 --> 05:14:57.558 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative
 
05:14:59.868 --> 05:14:59.878 align:start position:0%
grber uh director thank you very much
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
these are very very valuable thoughts
 
05:15:04.910 --> 05:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
and and comments uh can we get uh a copy
 
05:15:06.708 --> 05:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
of these in writing or sit down with you
 
05:15:08.430 --> 05:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
and and discuss how these would work
 
05:15:10.150 --> 05:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
specifically we're happy to do that we
 
05:15:11.788 --> 05:15:11.798 align:start position:0%
can I can summarize them in a in a
 
05:15:13.990 --> 05:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
letter and then uh and provide that to
 
05:15:15.788 --> 05:15:15.798 align:start position:0%
the committee and to the sponsor great
 
05:15:17.910 --> 05:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
you thanks very much representative
 
05:15:20.030 --> 05:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:15:22.230 --> 05:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um Mr whims I
 
05:15:24.390 --> 05:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
think that your first two points were
 
05:15:27.030 --> 05:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
right on and I appreciate the feedback
 
05:15:30.390 --> 05:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
on the bill in regards with lines 9
 
05:15:33.670 --> 05:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
through 12 I think that there's a piece
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
that is missing it it's talking about
 
05:15:39.310 --> 05:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
the landfill that is currently fly
 
05:15:41.270 --> 05:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
permanent nothing to do with the
 
05:15:44.310 --> 05:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
expansion so I think that that's just a
 
05:15:46.310 --> 05:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's Crystal Clear there
 
05:15:46.320 --> 05:15:47.510 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's Crystal Clear there
so

05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:15:49.830 --> 05:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
I'm they're not it's not talking about a
 
05:15:51.910 --> 05:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
permanent expansion it's talking about
 
05:15:54.990 --> 05:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't apply for an operating fully
 
05:15:59.070 --> 05:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:01.310 --> 05:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
so I I I think I understand what you're
 
05:16:03.350 --> 05:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
saying I guess my only concern would be
 
05:16:04.628 --> 05:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
the the fully
 
05:16:04.638 --> 05:16:06.150 align:start position:0%
the the fully
permitted

05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
05:16:09.030 --> 05:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
um language is is potentially a little
 
05:16:12.350 --> 05:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
problematic because at some level maybe
 
05:16:14.190 --> 05:16:14.200 align:start position:0%
no landfill is ever fully permitted it's
 
05:16:17.548 --> 05:16:17.558 align:start position:0%
it's an ongoing evolving um regulatory
 
05:16:20.190 --> 05:16:20.200 align:start position:0%
framework and pretty much if you change
 
05:16:21.708 --> 05:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
your operating plan it's a permanent
 
05:16:24.310 --> 05:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
modification so and I'm I'm not trying
 
05:16:25.628 --> 05:16:25.638 align:start position:0%
to be difficult with that what I'm
 
05:16:27.270 --> 05:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
saying is if I see the here's the
 
05:16:29.390 --> 05:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
example let's say that the committee
 
05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
passes the bill and they expect that any
 
05:16:33.270 --> 05:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
existing land Fields can be expanded and
 
05:16:35.628 --> 05:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
aren't infected by the moratorium and
 
05:16:38.948 --> 05:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
then someone in uh a a location where
 
05:16:41.110 --> 05:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
that a Landfield is going to be expanded
 
05:16:43.070 --> 05:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't like it they may point to that
 
05:16:44.230 --> 05:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
and say well it's not really fully
 
05:16:45.548 --> 05:16:45.558 align:start position:0%
permitted so you're subject to the
 
05:16:47.948 --> 05:16:47.958 align:start position:0%
moratorium and all I'm suggesting is if
 
05:16:49.990 --> 05:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's not the intent of the legislature
 
05:16:51.948 --> 05:16:51.958 align:start position:0%
when it if it if it advances a bill like
 
05:16:53.548 --> 05:16:53.558 align:start position:0%
this we want to make sure that that
 
05:16:56.270 --> 05:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
language is really clear and accurate
 
05:16:58.548 --> 05:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't create that kind of a problem
 
05:17:00.948 --> 05:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you so much welcome okay
 
05:17:03.230 --> 05:17:03.240 align:start position:0%

05:17:18.470 --> 05:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
try to be available for technical

05:17:55.830 --> 05:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:57.868 --> 05:17:57.878 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you madam chair for
 
05:18:01.390 --> 05:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
having me um I'm actually presenting the
 
05:18:03.868 --> 05:18:03.878 align:start position:0%
next bill so I can sit here after I'm
 
05:18:06.948 --> 05:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
done talking um uh yeah anyway so I I
 
05:18:10.990 --> 05:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
just you're talking about h 171 171 yes
 
05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to say uh I support
 
05:18:15.150 --> 05:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
this bill I come from Bethlehem where as
 
05:18:17.390 --> 05:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
we know one of the landfills is and
 
05:18:18.990 --> 05:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
where the location of one of the
 
05:18:20.670 --> 05:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
controversial potential sites of a new
 
05:18:22.830 --> 05:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
landfill is going to be adjacent to our
 
05:18:26.270 --> 05:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
town uh right on our border so uh I I
 
05:18:28.150 --> 05:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
think this is a great idea moving
 
05:18:29.548 --> 05:18:29.558 align:start position:0%
forward to try to give us a little bit
 
05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
of time this has been a contentious
 
05:18:35.150 --> 05:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
issue in our state for years now um
 
05:18:37.190 --> 05:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
since before I was in the legislature
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
and I think uh some of the some of the
 
05:18:42.948 --> 05:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
um suggestions and the wording that was
 
05:18:44.868 --> 05:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
just made uh
 
05:18:47.788 --> 05:18:47.798 align:start position:0%
previously um maybe can be worked into
 
05:18:49.030 --> 05:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
making this a little bit better but I
 
05:18:50.830 --> 05:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
think all in all this is something that
 
05:18:52.750 --> 05:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
we should support we need to take a
 
05:18:54.270 --> 05:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
little time to make sure we get our
 
05:18:56.350 --> 05:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
regulations um more modernized with
 
05:18:57.948 --> 05:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
respect to landfill sighting and I hope
 
05:19:00.548 --> 05:19:00.558 align:start position:0%
that the committee will take time to to
 
05:19:02.510 --> 05:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
pass this reg legislation to give us a
 
05:19:06.150 --> 05:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
chance to do that um you know so that we
 
05:19:07.510 --> 05:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a landfill crunch in the
 
05:19:09.150 --> 05:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
future we have a little bit of Runway
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
and I think we should not dump the gun
 
05:19:13.470 --> 05:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
and and approve things before we really
 
05:19:15.510 --> 05:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
need to and potentially put them in
 
05:19:17.708 --> 05:19:17.718 align:start position:0%
places that we will uh that people in
 
05:19:19.628 --> 05:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
future Generations will be regretting so
 
05:19:21.788 --> 05:19:21.798 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
05:19:26.750 --> 05:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
much I appreciate your uh time and uh
 
05:19:29.708 --> 05:19:29.718 align:start position:0%
can I have the blue sheet for HB
 
05:19:35.350 --> 05:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
171 um and also want to report
 
05:19:39.750 --> 05:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
that for this particular Bill the uh
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
online support was
 
05:19:46.670 --> 05:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
292 in support of this legislation six
 
05:19:50.110 --> 05:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
people in opposition on our blue sheet
 
05:19:52.590 --> 05:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
we have eight
 
05:19:56.510 --> 05:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
people uh in support of this bill and
 
05:19:58.350 --> 05:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close the hearing
 
05:20:02.708 --> 05:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:08.190 --> 05:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
171 um we are about 20 minutes out or 18
 
05:20:11.350 --> 05:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
minutes out from uh our our
 
05:20:13.590 --> 05:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
hr13 but we've all been sitting here for
 
05:20:15.750 --> 05:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
quite a while and I wonder if anybody

05:20:23.270 --> 05:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
minutes get
 
05:20:26.990 --> 05:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
out no we cannot do that no no so we
 
05:20:29.190 --> 05:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
either start the bill or just take a
 
05:20:29.200 --> 05:20:35.548 align:start position:0%
either start the bill or just take a

day is everyone here all
 
05:26:51.948 --> 05:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
right I am going to open the hearing for
 
05:26:54.270 --> 05:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
hr13 opposing the permitting of a
 
05:26:56.670 --> 05:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
landfill next to Forest Lake State Park
 
05:26:59.670 --> 05:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
in Dalton New Hampshire and I uh leave
 
05:27:01.708 --> 05:27:01.718 align:start position:0%
it to representative Sullivan to
 
05:27:03.910 --> 05:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
introduce this Bill thank you thank you
 
05:27:05.628 --> 05:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
05:27:09.830 --> 05:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
um so I decided to put in this house
 
05:27:12.548 --> 05:27:12.558 align:start position:0%
resolution because I think there's been
 
05:27:14.670 --> 05:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
so much drama around citing of this
 
05:27:18.310 --> 05:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
specific landfill and as everybody in
 
05:27:20.030 --> 05:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
this committee is well aware there's a
 
05:27:22.868 --> 05:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
lot of there's been a lot of uh
 
05:27:24.628 --> 05:27:24.638 align:start position:0%
animosity and there's been a lot of
 
05:27:25.948 --> 05:27:25.958 align:start position:0%
arguing there's been a lot of
 
05:27:28.510 --> 05:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
controversy All Surrounded surrounding
 
05:27:30.310 --> 05:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh landfill sighting in this in this
 
05:27:33.110 --> 05:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
state our laws I think have been proven
 
05:27:35.070 --> 05:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit outdated and that's
 
05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
something that we need time as some of
 
05:27:39.070 --> 05:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
the other bills that we've us today are
 
05:27:40.150 --> 05:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
are trying to address but they're a
 
05:27:42.830 --> 05:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
little bit outdated and we need time to
 
05:27:45.150 --> 05:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh come up with better regulations
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
around the sighting of landfills but one
 
05:27:49.510 --> 05:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
thing I think is not controversial at
 
05:27:50.910 --> 05:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
least it's not controversial to me and I
 
05:27:51.628 --> 05:27:51.638 align:start position:0%
honestly I don't think it's
 
05:27:53.230 --> 05:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
controversial to to the majority of
 
05:27:55.948 --> 05:27:55.958 align:start position:0%
people I speak to if you look at the rep
 
05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh the representatives as co-sponsors
 
05:28:00.708 --> 05:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
this is a very bipartisan
 
05:28:03.910 --> 05:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsorship is Forest Lake the Forest
 
05:28:05.948 --> 05:28:05.958 align:start position:0%
Lake location is not a good location for
 
05:28:09.948 --> 05:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
a landfill the soil there right is very
 
05:28:11.788 --> 05:28:11.798 align:start position:0%
porous as I'm sure many of you have
 
05:28:13.390 --> 05:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
heard in other testimonies throughout
 
05:28:14.548 --> 05:28:14.558 align:start position:0%
the years if you've served on this
 
05:28:15.910 --> 05:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
committee before or have been paying
 
05:28:18.948 --> 05:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
attention to the The Saga of this
 
05:28:21.510 --> 05:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
specific landfill for the past uh many
 
05:28:23.548 --> 05:28:23.558 align:start position:0%
years it's it's just not a great
 
05:28:26.070 --> 05:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
location in terms of um if things start
 
05:28:27.788 --> 05:28:27.798 align:start position:0%
leaking it would go into Forest Lake or
 
05:28:30.030 --> 05:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
into the adjacent river system which
 
05:28:32.990 --> 05:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
feeds into the Connecticut I
 
05:28:35.830 --> 05:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
think it's it's a very reasonable stance
 
05:28:37.548 --> 05:28:37.558 align:start position:0%
while this has I acknowledge I
 
05:28:39.430 --> 05:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
acknowledge has no teeth it's just our
 
05:28:41.390 --> 05:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
our stance as a as a body if we were to
 
05:28:43.190 --> 05:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
pass this through the house I think it
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
sends a strong message that this is
 
05:28:48.270 --> 05:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
something that is is not a good it's not
 
05:28:51.150 --> 05:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
a good idea to have something next to a
 
05:28:53.830 --> 05:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
a lake um in in the Hampshire's first
 
05:28:57.910 --> 05:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
state park that has Lake and if we could
 
05:29:00.868 --> 05:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
pass this I think that would um help get
 
05:29:03.310 --> 05:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
us a little bit of of news coverage for
 
05:29:04.910 --> 05:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state a lot of times up
 
05:29:06.390 --> 05:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
north where I'm from and where a few
 
05:29:08.548 --> 05:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
members on this committee are from
 
05:29:09.910 --> 05:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
we sort of sometimes feel like we're
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
ignored by people in the South where the
 
05:29:15.628 --> 05:29:15.638 align:start position:0%
population is and and this this bill is
 
05:29:17.788 --> 05:29:17.798 align:start position:0%
kind of risen above that or sorry this
 
05:29:19.470 --> 05:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
issue is risen above that this this
 
05:29:22.270 --> 05:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
landfill on at Forest Lake I think this
 
05:29:23.750 --> 05:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
resolution would just elevate it that
 
05:29:26.350 --> 05:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
much further and bring this this
 
05:29:28.708 --> 05:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
controversial issue to the mainstream
 
05:29:30.110 --> 05:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
even more than it already has been
 
05:29:31.750 --> 05:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
through the great advocacy of many of
 
05:29:32.990 --> 05:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
the people who've been opposing this for
 
05:29:35.310 --> 05:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
years and it would hopefully help really
 
05:29:38.510 --> 05:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
solid solidify um the the position of
 
05:29:39.948 --> 05:29:39.958 align:start position:0%
the state that this is not a good place
 
05:29:42.190 --> 05:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
for this and we need to hold off on
 
05:29:44.430 --> 05:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
putting a landfill in one of the more
 
05:29:46.270 --> 05:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
beautiful parts of our state that is
 
05:29:48.430 --> 05:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous if there's leaking
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
and because of all the uh hydrology of
 
05:29:52.310 --> 05:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
the soil in the area of that area of
 
05:29:54.670 --> 05:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
that location and give us some more time
 
05:29:57.030 --> 05:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
to find better locations and and better
 
05:29:59.948 --> 05:29:59.958 align:start position:0%
regulations so um that's the motivation
 
05:30:02.390 --> 05:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
behind this and I really hope that you
 
05:30:04.590 --> 05:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
guys will um consider this and hopefully
 
05:30:07.150 --> 05:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
we can in a in a few weeks time be
 
05:30:09.390 --> 05:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
celebrating passage on the
 
05:30:13.030 --> 05:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
house any questions from the
 
05:30:15.548 --> 05:30:15.558 align:start position:0%
committee um I do have a quick question
 
05:30:15.558 --> 05:30:19.230 align:start position:0%
committee um I do have a quick question
actually

05:30:19.230 --> 05:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:23.070 --> 05:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
um seeing as uh house house resolutions
 
05:30:25.670 --> 05:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
like kind of don't go anywhere they
 
05:30:27.628 --> 05:30:27.638 align:start position:0%
don't go to the well they the Senate
 
05:30:31.150 --> 05:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
never does anything with them um how do
 
05:30:35.470 --> 05:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
you feel that this is um you
 
05:30:38.430 --> 05:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
know meaningful to do
 
05:30:41.150 --> 05:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so and and I as I said when I was
 
05:30:43.110 --> 05:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
presenting this I think that I I
 
05:30:44.390 --> 05:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there's no teeth to a
 
05:30:45.830 --> 05:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
house resolution but what it does is it
 
05:30:47.670 --> 05:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
shows this is the position of the house
 
05:30:50.270 --> 05:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
and that should Elevate this issue
 
05:30:51.990 --> 05:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide because that will get covered
 
05:30:53.830 --> 05:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
in the media that'll show that the
 
05:30:57.150 --> 05:30:57.160 align:start position:0%
majority of the house and that would be
 
05:30:57.160 --> 05:30:57.948 align:start position:0%
majority of the house and that would be
a

05:30:57.948 --> 05:30:57.958 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:31:00.750 --> 05:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
bipartisan vote if if we can pass this
 
05:31:02.390 --> 05:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
the majority of people in the house
 
05:31:05.150 --> 05:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of party do not want this
 
05:31:06.788 --> 05:31:06.798 align:start position:0%
landfill think this is an inappropriate
 
05:31:08.750 --> 05:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
site for a landfill is there teeth
 
05:31:09.990 --> 05:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
behind it no and I acknowledge that
 
05:31:11.788 --> 05:31:11.798 align:start position:0%
there isn't but I think elevating this
 
05:31:13.150 --> 05:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
issue and showing that there's a
 
05:31:14.910 --> 05:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support something that we can
 
05:31:17.628 --> 05:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
all unite behind is a great message for
 
05:31:19.510 --> 05:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire because
 
05:31:20.830 --> 05:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
increasingly it's rare that we see
 
05:31:22.830 --> 05:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
bipartisan work and when when we do see
 
05:31:25.070 --> 05:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
it the citizens celebrate that they love
 
05:31:28.070 --> 05:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
that and B it would also just Elevate
 
05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
this issue for the people who live in
 
05:31:31.310 --> 05:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the state whether
 
05:31:33.990 --> 05:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's Portsmith or nashor Manchester a
 
05:31:35.628 --> 05:31:35.638 align:start position:0%
lot of these people don't actually
 
05:31:37.470 --> 05:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
understand some of the issues going on
 
05:31:39.750 --> 05:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
with to this bill and so this would just
 
05:31:41.948 --> 05:31:41.958 align:start position:0%
get a little bit more news coverage and
 
05:31:43.430 --> 05:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know we all know a lot of people a
 
05:31:44.788 --> 05:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
lot of our constituents are living in
 
05:31:45.788 --> 05:31:45.798 align:start position:0%
bubbles they're not always paying
 
05:31:47.150 --> 05:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
attention to issues that are not in
 
05:31:49.350 --> 05:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
their backyards and you there's not a
 
05:31:50.670 --> 05:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
lot of people up in this part of the
 
05:31:53.390 --> 05:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
state and so this is a good way for us
 
05:31:55.030 --> 05:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
to sort of magnify an issue that's
 
05:31:56.390 --> 05:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
really important to us and should be
 
05:31:59.628 --> 05:31:59.638 align:start position:0%
important to them do you feel that um
 
05:32:02.190 --> 05:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
the issue of citing a landfill in dalon
 
05:32:03.990 --> 05:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
has not gotten enough
 
05:32:06.590 --> 05:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
press no I'm I'm I think it's done
 
05:32:08.110 --> 05:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
they've done a great job The Advocate
 
05:32:10.110 --> 05:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
advocates for it have done a great job
 
05:32:12.310 --> 05:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
in uh elevating it but I think that this
 
05:32:14.788 --> 05:32:14.798 align:start position:0%
would be a way to elevate it even more
 
05:32:16.190 --> 05:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
because it would it sent a message that
 
05:32:18.030 --> 05:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
this is the official position of the
 
05:32:20.310 --> 05:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
house if if this were to pass this would
 
05:32:22.110 --> 05:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
be the official position of the house
 
05:32:23.470 --> 05:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
and I think that that would that would
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
be a statement and it's own right that
 
05:32:26.310 --> 05:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:32:28.948 --> 05:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
newsworthy okay thank you representative
 
05:32:31.030 --> 05:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
ger and representative wheeler if you
 
05:32:33.590 --> 05:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
need to sit you may please go to your
 
05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
seat thank you madam chair thank you
 
05:32:38.030 --> 05:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan um would you you
 
05:32:41.230 --> 05:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
say that a a house resolution in
 
05:32:43.070 --> 05:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
addition to the statement that has been
 
05:32:46.270 --> 05:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
made by the governor provides added
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
added weight does it mean more for a
 
05:32:49.670 --> 05:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
house resolution on this issue do you
 
05:32:52.310 --> 05:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
think to pass given the statement that
 
05:32:53.788 --> 05:32:53.798 align:start position:0%
the governor's already made and does
 
05:32:56.670 --> 05:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
that perhaps also send a message to the
 
05:32:59.270 --> 05:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
body on the other side of the wall uh if
 
05:33:02.430 --> 05:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
future action uh is required yeah I mean
 
05:33:06.470 --> 05:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
I think if two of the three um branches
 
05:33:08.788 --> 05:33:08.798 align:start position:0%
of of of government
 
05:33:12.948 --> 05:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
are in in in in uh are ear in agreement
 
05:33:15.190 --> 05:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
on this then I mean that's a pretty
 
05:33:17.070 --> 05:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
powerful statement and you know the
 
05:33:18.868 --> 05:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
government has been pretty clear on this
 
05:33:21.548 --> 05:33:21.558 align:start position:0%
and if we are clear about it then it's
 
05:33:24.190 --> 05:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
hard to imagine that um the the people
 
05:33:25.708 --> 05:33:25.718 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the of the wall are
 
05:33:27.708 --> 05:33:27.718 align:start position:0%
going to Buck that Trend sorry I didn't
 
05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
give you that thank you any other
 
05:33:31.670 --> 05:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee uh
 
05:33:33.628 --> 05:33:33.638 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler I have a question
 
05:33:36.350 --> 05:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
for you madam chair um is the house
 
05:33:39.868 --> 05:33:39.878 align:start position:0%
resolution able you put on the consent
 
05:33:41.750 --> 05:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
calendar I don't
 
05:33:46.788 --> 05:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
know I would imagine it should I I will
 
05:33:49.590 --> 05:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
ask that question of our uh house clerk
 
05:33:52.350 --> 05:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
I I believe it is but that would be a
 
05:33:53.910 --> 05:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
question for the committee
 
05:33:57.190 --> 05:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
to I believe that a house resolution can
 
05:34:00.590 --> 05:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
be on the consent calendar but given
 
05:34:03.708 --> 05:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
that the idea behind a house resolution
 
05:34:06.110 --> 05:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
is to make a point about something
 
05:34:08.270 --> 05:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
public it might make sense sense not to
 
05:34:09.990 --> 05:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
put it on the consent calendar and just
 
05:34:12.350 --> 05:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
have a and even if we all agree on it
 
05:34:14.948 --> 05:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
have a a brief speech at the well saying
 
05:34:17.830 --> 05:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
this is um this is a great idea let's
 
05:34:19.230 --> 05:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
all support
 
05:34:22.868 --> 05:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
it okay well does a resolution need a
 
05:34:24.430 --> 05:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
simple majority in the house do we know
 
05:34:25.750 --> 05:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
that I thought it needed more than a
 
05:34:27.030 --> 05:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
simple majority in which case it
 
05:34:29.590 --> 05:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't go on consent is it simple I'm
 
05:34:31.310 --> 05:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
not sure for that
 
05:34:34.470 --> 05:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
either um but I do
 
05:34:36.990 --> 05:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
know par pardon me do you mind if I
 
05:34:38.628 --> 05:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
leave at there's a question for me I
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
have to go to work sure than sure
 
05:34:44.070 --> 05:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's no questions for you um but I
 
05:34:45.390 --> 05:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
but I do know that there are a fair
 
05:34:48.548 --> 05:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
amount of house reps that will not
 
05:34:50.548 --> 05:34:50.558 align:start position:0%
support house resolutions because they
 
05:34:52.990 --> 05:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
don't feel that they are meaningful at
 
05:34:57.430 --> 05:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
all so there's that I'm just just
 
05:35:00.830 --> 05:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
saying uh I call Carolyn
 
05:35:10.350 --> 05:35:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:12.750 --> 05:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thanks for hanging in
 
05:35:16.548 --> 05:35:16.558 align:start position:0%

45 with breast cancer and told I had
 
05:35:51.670 --> 05:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
three years to live and then 20 years
 
05:35:56.590 --> 05:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
later um thyroid cancer and I took a a
 
05:35:56.600 --> 05:35:57.548 align:start position:0%
later um thyroid cancer and I took a a
moral

05:35:57.548 --> 05:35:57.558 align:start position:0%
moral
 
05:36:02.430 --> 05:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
obligation way back when as a 45y old
 
05:36:06.548 --> 05:36:06.558 align:start position:0%
with two very young children that uh I
 
05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
would do whatever
 
05:36:08.718 --> 05:36:09.590 align:start position:0%
would do whatever
I

05:36:09.590 --> 05:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:36:12.670 --> 05:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
could uh to
 
05:36:16.868 --> 05:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
prevent cancer in all its forms to the
 
05:36:20.070 --> 05:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
best of my knowledge and I was a TV
 
05:36:24.390 --> 05:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
reporter for 30 years at tv13 Nasa that
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
I owned with my husband Gordon and I
 
05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
spent many an hour up here in conquer so
 
05:36:35.390 --> 05:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
I know all about the media and uh we do
 
05:36:37.948 --> 05:36:37.958 align:start position:0%
care in Southern New Hampshire about
 
05:36:41.510 --> 05:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
this Lake and we do care about or I care
 
05:36:44.150 --> 05:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
about all the different causes of
 
05:36:48.590 --> 05:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
cancer my last Bel with cancer was
 
05:36:52.390 --> 05:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
thyroid and uh
 
05:36:57.070 --> 05:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
PFS are a definite cause I now uh spend
 
05:36:59.110 --> 05:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
my time between working full-time at
 
05:37:00.548 --> 05:37:00.558 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire
 
05:37:03.948 --> 05:37:03.958 align:start position:0%
University and writing
 
05:37:09.390 --> 05:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
about uh epigenetic forms of diet and
 
05:37:11.628 --> 05:37:11.638 align:start position:0%
all the different ways that cancer is
 
05:37:14.430 --> 05:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
making its way into our lives and just
 
05:37:17.030 --> 05:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
happens that my column this week is
 
05:37:20.750 --> 05:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
about PFS and all the
 
05:37:24.030 --> 05:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
ways it is working its way into our
 
05:37:28.788 --> 05:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
lives I would vouch to say that we're
 
05:37:33.230 --> 05:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
consuming it all in our water every day
 
05:37:35.628 --> 05:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
because unless you're drinking uh
 
05:37:38.030 --> 05:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
reverse osmosis water
 
05:37:39.990 --> 05:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
you are consuming
 
05:37:44.670 --> 05:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
PFS every day everything you eat
 
05:37:47.910 --> 05:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
everything you drink Everything You
 
05:37:47.920 --> 05:37:50.070 align:start position:0%
everything you drink Everything You
Touch

05:37:50.070 --> 05:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
Touch
 
05:37:53.910 --> 05:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
and to think that there is yet this
 
05:37:56.110 --> 05:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
beautiful little piece of
 
05:38:00.390 --> 05:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
property uh indeed the first state park
 
05:38:03.670 --> 05:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
when I found out that someone
 
05:38:06.270 --> 05:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
was I don't know if I want to say crazy
 
05:38:11.510 --> 05:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:13.708 --> 05:38:13.718 align:start position:0%
um ambitious
 
05:38:18.750 --> 05:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
enough um to take advantage of
 
05:38:23.310 --> 05:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
our Live Free or Die sort of uh
 
05:38:23.320 --> 05:38:24.990 align:start position:0%
our Live Free or Die sort of uh
libertarianism

05:38:24.990 --> 05:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
libertarianism
 
05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
um knowing that cassella does even
 
05:38:32.628 --> 05:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
mention on its website about its support
 
05:38:38.110 --> 05:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
and idealism ideology for sustainability
 
05:38:41.628 --> 05:38:41.638 align:start position:0%
I really had to shake my head because I
 
05:38:45.070 --> 05:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
thought at what price
 
05:38:48.670 --> 05:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
so I
 
05:38:52.788 --> 05:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
uh drove up to Dalton and
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how many nashin have done
 
05:38:59.750 --> 05:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
that but I did because I wanted to know
 
05:39:02.670 --> 05:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
firsthand what are these people facing
 
05:39:02.680 --> 05:39:03.510 align:start position:0%
firsthand what are these people facing
and

05:39:03.510 --> 05:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:09.150 --> 05:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
why um and and is anyone listening
 
05:39:09.160 --> 05:39:10.070 align:start position:0%
why um and and is anyone listening
I'm

05:39:10.070 --> 05:39:10.080 align:start position:0%

05:39:14.708 --> 05:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
nobody but I'm a New Hampshire resident
 
05:39:20.310 --> 05:39:20.320 align:start position:0%

05:39:32.990 --> 05:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
off work today to come up here but by
 
05:39:35.468 --> 05:39:35.478 align:start position:0%
golly I think I represent a lot of

05:40:17.878 --> 05:40:19.390 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of a lot of people who
don't

05:40:19.390 --> 05:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%

05:40:37.510 --> 05:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
no-brainer and I do seriously hope we

committee I'm here today to ask you to
 
05:43:25.110 --> 05:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
vote Yes on house resolution
 
05:43:28.150 --> 05:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
13 to keep a landfill from being built
 
05:43:30.948 --> 05:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
next to Forest Lake State Park one of
 
05:43:33.430 --> 05:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's 10 original
 
05:43:36.868 --> 05:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
parks there are actually 93 state parks
 
05:43:39.670 --> 05:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
in total in New Hampshire and they all
 
05:43:42.628 --> 05:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
deserve protection from projects that
 
05:43:45.548 --> 05:43:45.558 align:start position:0%
would threaten their natural resources
 
05:43:48.468 --> 05:43:48.478 align:start position:0%
and Beauty as well as endanger public
 
05:43:51.628 --> 05:43:51.638 align:start position:0%
health and harm our tourism industry
 
05:43:54.110 --> 05:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
which drives New Hampshire's
 
05:43:58.070 --> 05:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
economy however only one of these 93
 
05:44:00.948 --> 05:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
state parks is being threatened by the
 
05:44:04.190 --> 05:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
construction of a mega landfill with the
 
05:44:07.628 --> 05:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
potential to occupy over time
 
05:44:08.590 --> 05:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
up to
 
05:44:14.270 --> 05:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
1,800 Greenfield Acres including all its
 
05:44:16.628 --> 05:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
infrastructure a mountain of trash
 
05:44:19.750 --> 05:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
admittedly 50% from out of state would
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
be situated on porest Sand and Gravel
 
05:44:26.510 --> 05:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
next to the pristine gem Forest Lake as
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
well as the eMusic River Watershed and
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
Acres of wetlands and fragile
 
05:44:36.510 --> 05:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
ecosystems I will not review with all of
 
05:44:38.190 --> 05:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
you what you have heard about
 
05:44:41.430 --> 05:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
degradation and dangers of
 
05:44:44.430 --> 05:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
landfills you've heard enough of that
 
05:44:47.310 --> 05:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
today but we are talking about the air
 
05:44:50.510 --> 05:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
we breathe the water we drink and the
 
05:44:53.750 --> 05:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
soil we grow our food in for generations
 
05:44:53.760 --> 05:44:54.868 align:start position:0%
soil we grow our food in for generations
to

05:44:54.868 --> 05:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:44:57.788 --> 05:44:57.798 align:start position:0%
come and Judy my last sentence kind of
 
05:44:59.670 --> 05:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
has you in mind from what you said
 
05:45:03.868 --> 05:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
earlier I know house resolution 13 is a
 
05:45:03.878 --> 05:45:05.548 align:start position:0%
earlier I know house resolution 13 is a
non-binding

05:45:05.548 --> 05:45:05.558 align:start position:0%
non-binding
 
05:45:08.030 --> 05:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
determination but it would stand as a
 
05:45:11.430 --> 05:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
symbol and as a signal of what New
 
05:45:14.670 --> 05:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire values and is committed to
 
05:45:17.150 --> 05:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
protecting for its citizens and the
 
05:45:17.160 --> 05:45:19.150 align:start position:0%
protecting for its citizens and the
environment

05:45:19.150 --> 05:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
environment
 
05:45:21.670 --> 05:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
here thank you for your thoughtful
 
05:45:28.788 --> 05:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:32.350 --> 05:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
resolution good okay thank you thank you
 
05:45:35.110 --> 05:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
um you have written testimony to submit
 
05:45:36.590 --> 05:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
I do I didn't know it was important
 
05:45:39.230 --> 05:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
enough sure we'd like to include that in
 
05:45:39.240 --> 05:45:45.390 align:start position:0%
enough sure we'd like to include that in
our

05:45:45.390 --> 05:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:48.628 --> 05:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
file uh call the last pin card unless
 
05:45:50.910 --> 05:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
anybody else would like to speak U Mr
 
05:46:11.510 --> 05:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:14.230 --> 05:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and members
 
05:46:15.948 --> 05:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for hearing
 
05:46:15.958 --> 05:46:16.670 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for hearing
my

05:46:16.670 --> 05:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:46:19.670 --> 05:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
testimony um my name is John Swan I live
 
05:46:22.030 --> 05:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
in Dalton New Hampshire I do not live on
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake uh I live near it and use it
 
05:46:29.110 --> 05:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
um prior uh I I do need to preface my
 
05:46:30.670 --> 05:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
testimony by stating that in order to
 
05:46:33.310 --> 05:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
not get sued a third time by cassella I
 
05:46:34.708 --> 05:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
need you to understand that all of this
 
05:46:37.350 --> 05:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
is my opinion based on my research
 
05:46:40.430 --> 05:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
and experience um you know and part of
 
05:46:42.350 --> 05:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
that it you know it's kind of funny to
 
05:46:44.548 --> 05:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
have to add that to uh basically my
 
05:46:47.070 --> 05:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
public statements but
 
05:46:50.590 --> 05:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
um in April of 2020 uh cassella filed
 
05:46:52.868 --> 05:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
suit against me for uh claiming 39
 
05:46:55.310 --> 05:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
statements I made were defamatory and
 
05:46:58.310 --> 05:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
then uh that basically uh through the
 
05:47:00.110 --> 05:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
process with the judicial system it was
 
05:47:01.830 --> 05:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
Whitted down to nine and then ultimately
 
05:47:03.708 --> 05:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
we wound up settling uh they didn't want
 
05:47:05.548 --> 05:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
to go to court uh signed a
 
05:47:07.350 --> 05:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreement
 
05:47:09.190 --> 05:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
and then uh two weeks later that didn't
 
05:47:10.788 --> 05:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
like the new story that came out in the
 
05:47:13.150 --> 05:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
Caledonian record about the story and
 
05:47:15.788 --> 05:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
they filed a second suit against me for
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
um basically saying I uh I violated the
 
05:47:21.230 --> 05:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreement and since then
 
05:47:23.468 --> 05:47:23.478 align:start position:0%
the uh uh reporter that did call me I
 
05:47:26.390 --> 05:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
told him no comment um he uh filed a
 
05:47:28.628 --> 05:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
deposition stating that he never did
 
05:47:30.270 --> 05:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
speak with me about the story John
 
05:47:32.468 --> 05:47:32.478 align:start position:0%
cassella just didn't like the story and
 
05:47:34.468 --> 05:47:34.478 align:start position:0%
then uh since then theyve amended their
 
05:47:37.468 --> 05:47:37.478 align:start position:0%
complaint against me to include
 
05:47:40.150 --> 05:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh statements by them saying my my
 
05:47:42.788 --> 05:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
assertions that the NCS landfill is
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
contaminating The Watershed of the amonk
 
05:47:49.070 --> 05:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
river are false and defamatory so um I
 
05:47:50.788 --> 05:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
think the groundwater reports that they
 
05:47:54.628 --> 05:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
submit uh via sandborn head
 
05:47:57.830 --> 05:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
um will uh help that in court we will be
 
05:47:59.830 --> 05:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
in court in September I believe but uh
 
05:48:02.350 --> 05:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
it's cost me over approximately $200,000
 
05:48:04.990 --> 05:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
in legal fees uh so far with all the
 
05:48:07.948 --> 05:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
lawsuits um but I do want to uh you know
 
05:48:10.708 --> 05:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
I really can't Nancy's a hard act to
 
05:48:13.628 --> 05:48:13.638 align:start position:0%
follow I just want to mention that I did
 
05:48:16.270 --> 05:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
email you my testimony and in that I
 
05:48:18.270 --> 05:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
included a two-pager it's a for Lake
 
05:48:21.868 --> 05:48:21.878 align:start position:0%
State part uh GSL landfill info sheet I
 
05:48:24.030 --> 05:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
hope you'll read it I've gone through I
 
05:48:25.590 --> 05:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
mean I've I've
 
05:48:29.190 --> 05:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
spent hours reading all these documents
 
05:48:29.200 --> 05:48:30.390 align:start position:0%
spent hours reading all these documents
these

05:48:30.390 --> 05:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:48:33.628 --> 05:48:33.638 align:start position:0%
applications and this breaks down the
 
05:48:35.590 --> 05:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
impacts that this will have on the North
 
05:48:37.788 --> 05:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
country but I also want to share the
 
05:48:39.110 --> 05:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
fact that the one thing that has
 
05:48:41.670 --> 05:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
remained constant um they withdrew the
 
05:48:44.310 --> 05:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
first set of applications resubmitted
 
05:48:46.670 --> 05:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
again they had to whittle it down to a
 
05:48:48.030 --> 05:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
right now they're calling it a one-phase
 
05:48:51.708 --> 05:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
only 70 acre 18-year landfill the one
 
05:48:52.990 --> 05:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
thing that's remained constant is
 
05:48:54.270 --> 05:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
they're seeking
 
05:48:57.910 --> 05:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
600,000 cubic yards of annual capacity
 
05:49:01.030 --> 05:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
converted to tonnage at a 78 rate which
 
05:49:03.990 --> 05:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
is typically used uh it's about 456,000
 
05:49:06.750 --> 05:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
tons a year um to put that in
 
05:49:09.110 --> 05:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
perspective the current permit for the
 
05:49:11.750 --> 05:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh stage six um operating permit for the
 
05:49:14.070 --> 05:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
NCS landfill is
 
05:49:17.070 --> 05:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
230,000 cubic yards or approximately
 
05:49:20.230 --> 05:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
180,000 tons a year so in essence
 
05:49:23.830 --> 05:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
cassella is seeking 2.5 times what
 
05:49:26.750 --> 05:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
they're currently taking in at the NCS
 
05:49:29.390 --> 05:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
landfill so just please that's in my in
 
05:49:31.948 --> 05:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
my uh testimony I sent you it's very
 
05:49:33.628 --> 05:49:33.638 align:start position:0%
important because they say it's an
 
05:49:35.910 --> 05:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
18-year landfill however they they have
 
05:49:38.390 --> 05:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
admitted and in discussions in Dalton
 
05:49:42.868 --> 05:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
with the select board there that the um
 
05:49:45.070 --> 05:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
the life of the facility is not over
 
05:49:47.830 --> 05:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
with until the capacity is is exhausted
 
05:49:49.468 --> 05:49:49.478 align:start position:0%
so if you take that
 
05:49:51.670 --> 05:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
230,000 cubic yards that they're
 
05:49:54.350 --> 05:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
currently doing at Bethlehem roll that
 
05:49:57.270 --> 05:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
into the 18 years times 600,000 cubic
 
05:50:00.910 --> 05:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
yards it's approximately 46 years of
 
05:50:04.070 --> 05:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
permitted life for this facility and
 
05:50:06.270 --> 05:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
that goes against the wishes or the
 
05:50:10.628 --> 05:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
intent of RSA 149 M which is calls for
 
05:50:13.830 --> 05:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
only a 20-year permitting period gives
 
05:50:15.310 --> 05:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
them a lot of wiggle room because let's
 
05:50:18.590 --> 05:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
say they do use that 600,000 cubic yards
 
05:50:20.750 --> 05:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
based on what they're bringing into the
 
05:50:23.830 --> 05:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem facility 60% of that would be
 
05:50:26.270 --> 05:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
from out of state so just something to
 
05:50:27.708 --> 05:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
keep in mind it's giving them a lot of
 
05:50:29.990 --> 05:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
wiggle room and then of course as Nancy
 
05:50:31.510 --> 05:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned they have
 
05:50:35.070 --> 05:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
1,899 acres of land under contract they
 
05:50:37.990 --> 05:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
have not closed on that land yet so keep
 
05:50:40.390 --> 05:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
in mind they they can obviously walk
 
05:50:41.708 --> 05:50:41.718 align:start position:0%
away from the land deal if they don't
 
05:50:42.830 --> 05:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
get their permitting which is what
 
05:50:45.708 --> 05:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for so anyway um thank
 
05:50:48.750 --> 05:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
you for the long day of testimony and uh
 
05:50:51.590 --> 05:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
I really hope you'll you'll you'll it's
 
05:50:53.990 --> 05:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
a symbolic gesture but this is the
 
05:50:56.430 --> 05:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
people's house I mean we've been coming
 
05:50:59.430 --> 05:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
to you for six years for help so you
 
05:51:02.270 --> 05:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
know please I mean there a lot of lives
 
05:51:03.948 --> 05:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of families that that couldn't be
 
05:51:05.670 --> 05:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
here today but their lives their
 
05:51:07.548 --> 05:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
properties would will be impacted by
 
05:51:10.030 --> 05:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
this facility so and we really don't
 
05:51:11.548 --> 05:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
want to lose that Lake it's a beautiful
 
05:51:14.150 --> 05:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
Lake it's clean there's no posos there
 
05:51:16.628 --> 05:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
there's no posos on the site property
 
05:51:18.430 --> 05:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
and there's no posos in our wells that's
 
05:51:20.270 --> 05:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
why I bring my water everywhere I don't
 
05:51:22.868 --> 05:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
get ice cubes when I go to a diner I
 
05:51:25.510 --> 05:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
don't know what's in the water my well
 
05:51:29.190 --> 05:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
no posos detection so thank you I
 
05:51:32.070 --> 05:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony this afternoon
 
05:51:34.910 --> 05:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee seeing
 
05:51:37.910 --> 05:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much appreciate it
 
05:51:42.390 --> 05:51:42.400 align:start position:0%

296 people in support thank you sir um
 
05:52:02.548 --> 05:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
in support six of six opposed one
 
05:52:07.510 --> 05:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
neutral and I have um you
 
05:52:11.270 --> 05:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
three four eight people in support of
 
05:52:14.468 --> 05:52:14.478 align:start position:0%
hr13 uh on the blue signup sheet and
 
05:52:16.350 --> 05:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close the hearing

on
 
05:52:21.270 --> 05:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
hr13 okay and um I do have a little bit
 
05:52:23.430 --> 05:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
of uh committee housekeeping that I just
 
05:52:27.670 --> 05:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
want to talk to you guys about um
 
05:52:29.670 --> 05:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative Penza you had a something
 
05:52:30.990 --> 05:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
to share with the committee yeah I'd
 
05:52:32.830 --> 05:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion that we can exec
 
05:52:36.590 --> 05:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
this bill right now um I not comfortable
 
05:52:36.600 --> 05:52:39.590 align:start position:0%
this bill right now um I not comfortable
doing

05:52:39.590 --> 05:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:42.708 --> 05:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
that one of
 
05:52:46.990 --> 05:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
the uh one of the Notions behind in
 
05:52:50.990 --> 05:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
general uh holding off to it for on exec
 
05:52:54.070 --> 05:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
until uh we can until it's been noticed
 
05:52:56.510 --> 05:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
in the calendar is that there are people
 
05:52:58.310 --> 05:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
who may be interested in being there for
 
05:53:00.628 --> 05:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
the exec session and they need to have
 
05:53:02.070 --> 05:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
proper warning that it's going to be
 
05:53:05.390 --> 05:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
coming up so I I think that uh having
 
05:53:07.750 --> 05:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
that um that is
 
05:53:11.990 --> 05:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
a as a part of a standard transparency
 
05:53:15.350 --> 05:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
is is important uh sometimes there is a
 
05:53:17.910 --> 05:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill that is fairly and the one that we
 
05:53:19.510 --> 05:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
did this afternoon that we did exact
 
05:53:22.910 --> 05:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
this afternoon uh Judy and I talked
 
05:53:28.590 --> 05:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
about that um well in advance of uh of
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
of doing it uh we and we um and uh we
 
05:53:36.948 --> 05:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
decided that because it was a very
 
05:53:36.958 --> 05:53:38.628 align:start position:0%
decided that because it was a very
non-controversial

05:53:38.628 --> 05:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
non-controversial
 
05:53:42.270 --> 05:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
Bill and um would would be served well
 
05:53:44.708 --> 05:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
by going through quickly uh it would
 
05:53:47.750 --> 05:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
make sense to exec but usually we are we
 
05:53:51.510 --> 05:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
we are we will almost always stick to
 
05:53:55.590 --> 05:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
having a at least the uh normal notice
 
05:53:58.510 --> 05:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:02.430 --> 05:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
exec okay I get it I just um just as a
 
05:54:04.430 --> 05:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
followup it's not a bill it's a
 
05:54:07.350 --> 05:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
resolution so we've listen to a lot of
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't see the necessity of
 
05:54:13.350 --> 05:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
of having an executive session on it it
 
05:54:13.360 --> 05:54:15.310 align:start position:0%
of having an executive session on it it
it's

05:54:15.310 --> 05:54:15.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:54:18.990 --> 05:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's okay all right representative
 
05:54:22.830 --> 05:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
Scully you had a question no okay so uh
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
representative kto you had something you
 
05:54:26.030 --> 05:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with the committee as
 
05:54:28.910 --> 05:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
well I do thank you madam chair um as
 
05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
always the young Farmers would like to
 
05:54:33.030 --> 05:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
do a breakfast for us uh this year
 
05:54:35.070 --> 05:54:35.080 align:start position:0%
they'd like to do it at a farm in London
 
05:54:37.910 --> 05:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
dery and they have given two dates um
 
05:54:41.150 --> 05:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
March 17th and March 24th and I just
 
05:54:42.548 --> 05:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to get a consensus from the
 
05:54:44.548 --> 05:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
committee which Tuesday would work best
 
05:54:44.558 --> 05:54:45.788 align:start position:0%
committee which Tuesday would work best
for

05:54:45.788 --> 05:54:45.798 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:54:49.230 --> 05:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
folks March when and when March 17th or
 
05:54:49.240 --> 05:54:50.070 align:start position:0%
folks March when and when March 17th or
March

05:54:50.070 --> 05:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
March
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
24th so those are both Mondays are they
 
05:54:56.990 --> 05:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
Mondays Yeah March 17th well I guess
 
05:54:58.990 --> 05:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
they're Mondays I thought they were
 
05:55:01.030 --> 05:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays maybe they they told me those
 
05:55:03.430 --> 05:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
dates but I told them Tuesday so uh
 
05:55:05.868 --> 05:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
let's think about March 18th and 25th
 
05:55:09.390 --> 05:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
also as possible so I'll give them those
 
05:55:11.150 --> 05:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
one of those two weeks I didn't know
 
05:55:14.910 --> 05:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:24.030 --> 05:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:29.430 --> 05:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
matter okay okay so I have a mo uh
 
05:55:32.628 --> 05:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
someone yeah right well they were
 
05:55:34.750 --> 05:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to give me Tuesday dates so I
 
05:55:37.150 --> 05:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
will let her know
 
05:55:38.868 --> 05:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
um and the idea was is so we could get
 
05:55:40.708 --> 05:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
to committee but obviously in March
 
05:55:41.788 --> 05:55:41.798 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be having committee
 
05:55:43.270 --> 05:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
meetings we're going to be having
 
05:55:45.990 --> 05:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
session so um but they do do a nice
 
05:55:50.190 --> 05:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
breakfast uh they bring in uh Farm milk
 
05:55:52.590 --> 05:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
uh bake everything with farm fresh eggs
 
05:55:56.030 --> 05:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
and uh maple syrup off the the farms and
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
berries it's it's it's good and uh you
 
05:56:00.750 --> 05:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
get to learn about what Young farmers
 
05:56:03.070 --> 05:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
are doing go ahead repres um s represent
 
05:56:05.468 --> 05:56:05.478 align:start position:0%
B so it is actually conceivable that we
 
05:56:07.590 --> 05:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
might be doing exex on that on the
 
05:56:09.868 --> 05:56:09.878 align:start position:0%
earlier date because that's before the
 
05:56:12.670 --> 05:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
Dead the second deadline of the the
 
05:56:17.310 --> 05:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
regular Bill deadline uh so um so it
 
05:56:19.430 --> 05:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
might make more sense to have the
 
05:56:22.110 --> 05:56:22.120 align:start position:0%
earlier date
 
05:56:25.390 --> 05:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
um yep are you saying do the breakfast
 
05:56:28.468 --> 05:56:28.478 align:start position:0%
on lat no no same day and then you come
 
05:56:29.788 --> 05:56:29.798 align:start position:0%
here same day because if we're doing
 
05:56:31.510 --> 05:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
exacts it's not going to be we're it's
 
05:56:33.110 --> 05:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
not going to be a full day of testimony
 
05:56:35.910 --> 05:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to be an hour or so here so
 
05:56:39.670 --> 05:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
we could do the do the breakfast have
 
05:56:42.070 --> 05:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
our execs at like 10:30 or something and
 
05:56:46.830 --> 05:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:49.390 --> 05:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
noon okay the other thing I wanted to
 
05:56:51.150 --> 05:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
bring up to the committee is school
 
05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
vacation week which is the week of
 
05:56:53.040 --> 05:56:54.390 align:start position:0%
vacation week which is the week of
February

05:56:54.390 --> 05:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
February
 
05:57:00.708 --> 05:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
23rd and um as I understand um the house
 
05:57:03.948 --> 05:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
would request house leadership has
 
05:57:06.788 --> 05:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
requested uh that we not schu anything
 
05:57:10.190 --> 05:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
for that week are we all okay with that
 
05:57:11.788 --> 05:57:11.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I know that there are some people
 
05:57:13.628 --> 05:57:13.638 align:start position:0%
who are going
 
05:57:17.910 --> 05:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
away the week of February
 
05:57:20.590 --> 05:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
24th so I'm not going to schedule any
 
05:57:21.830 --> 05:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
meetings for
 
05:57:23.830 --> 05:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
that for that
 
05:57:26.830 --> 05:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
week that being said I mean we we have a
 
05:57:28.510 --> 05:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
fair amount of bills to get through
 
05:57:30.468 --> 05:57:30.478 align:start position:0%
we've got 31 bills in our
 
05:57:34.750 --> 05:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
committee um and as we've seen uh
 
05:57:36.750 --> 05:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
several of them are a little
 
05:57:39.070 --> 05:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
complicated um and some of them have
 
05:57:42.070 --> 05:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
been taking um you know quite a a while
 
05:57:45.750 --> 05:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
in committee hearings so we may need to
 
05:57:48.310 --> 05:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
make one or two times where we're
 
05:57:50.468 --> 05:57:50.478 align:start position:0%
meeting twice a week instead of once a
 
05:57:52.830 --> 05:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
week and I kind of want to get an idea
 
05:57:57.190 --> 05:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
from the committee um what days would be
 
05:57:59.628 --> 05:57:59.638 align:start position:0%
preferable aside from a
 
05:58:03.030 --> 05:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
Tuesday uh what days would work best for
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
the majority of everybody for hearings
 
05:58:08.350 --> 05:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
or uh I I wouldn't schedule any exec
 
05:58:10.948 --> 05:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
sessions on that second day but just at
 
05:58:12.990 --> 05:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
least work sessions and hearings for
 
05:58:15.868 --> 05:58:15.878 align:start position:0%
those dates so I don't know if Mondays
 
05:58:17.708 --> 05:58:17.718 align:start position:0%
are better for
 
05:58:17.718 --> 05:58:21.110 align:start position:0%
are better for
people

05:58:21.110 --> 05:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:24.030 --> 05:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
no Wednesdays are generally Municipal
 
05:58:26.788 --> 05:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
and County uses the room we could but
 
05:58:29.070 --> 05:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
there are the rooms available there well
 
05:58:30.750 --> 05:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
you know could that could be a problem
 
05:58:35.030 --> 05:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
but I I'll see what we can
 
05:58:37.910 --> 05:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
do so my preference would be in this
 
05:58:42.350 --> 05:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
order uh Wednesdays Mondays and last
 
05:58:45.670 --> 05:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
last uh Resort Fridays okay Madam
 
05:58:47.910 --> 05:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
chairman I think we spoke earlier today
 
05:58:49.230 --> 05:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
during lunch there are going to be some
 
05:58:50.708 --> 05:58:50.718 align:start position:0%
some of those days I will not be able to
 
05:58:54.788 --> 05:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
make it and I U okay right thank you
 
05:58:57.708 --> 05:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
yep uh representative comor thank you um
 
05:58:59.430 --> 05:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
Madam chair Wednesdays would uh be
 
05:59:02.628 --> 05:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
preferable for me okay all right cool
 
05:59:05.830 --> 05:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
good to know and representative how also
 
05:59:08.548 --> 05:59:08.558 align:start position:0%

okay all right good to know um okay the
 
05:59:14.628 --> 05:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
other thing I wanted to get back to you
 
05:59:17.628 --> 05:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
all regarding some questions uh about
 
05:59:17.638 --> 05:59:18.788 align:start position:0%
all regarding some questions uh about
house

05:59:18.788 --> 05:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:59:21.350 --> 05:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
resolutions uh I did text our house
 
05:59:23.310 --> 05:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
clerk Paul Smith I said for house
 
05:59:25.110 --> 05:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
resolutions can they be on the consent
 
05:59:28.628 --> 05:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
calendar and he replied yes uh when the
 
05:59:30.910 --> 05:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
house votes on an HR is a prevailing
 
05:59:32.868 --> 05:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
vote a simple majority or a higher
 
05:59:36.030 --> 05:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
threshold and he said simple majority so
 
05:59:38.310 --> 05:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to share that with you
 
05:59:41.830 --> 05:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
all representative wheeler I would
 
05:59:45.390 --> 05:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
agree I agree with that but I also agree
 
05:59:47.788 --> 05:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
um uh I think that keeping it off the
 
05:59:49.830 --> 05:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
consent calendar is a good thing I was
 
05:59:51.990 --> 05:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
just I was just asking just to clarify
 
05:59:54.948 --> 05:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
from a procedural standpoint
 
05:59:58.070 --> 05:59:58.080 align:start position:0%

those bills to kind of clean them up and
 
06:01:17.548 --> 06:01:17.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:21.510 --> 06:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
great um I have a proposed schedule of
 
06:01:23.670 --> 06:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
bills which um already I can see is
 
06:01:28.310 --> 06:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
going to be changed um
 
06:01:32.350 --> 06:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
and um I heard
 
06:01:35.070 --> 06:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
today that the paint recycling bill was
 
06:01:37.670 --> 06:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
going to be vac ated to our
 
06:01:42.708 --> 06:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
committee but I but wait wait wait but I
 
06:01:44.910 --> 06:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
also know that Thursday Commerce is
 
06:01:46.468 --> 06:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
having a hearing on it that's already
 
06:01:50.070 --> 06:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
been noticed so I have indicated to
 
06:01:52.948 --> 06:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
represent uh to us the uh the house
 
06:01:57.190 --> 06:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
clerk Paul Smith that I choose not to
 
06:01:59.110 --> 06:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
have that bill vacated to our committee
 
06:02:01.990 --> 06:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
since Commerce has already scheduled a
 
06:02:05.628 --> 06:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
hearing and it's an early bill I don't
 
06:02:07.590 --> 06:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
know where we might be able to fit that
 
06:02:11.310 --> 06:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
in but um I have to still wait and hear
 
06:02:12.948 --> 06:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
back from them as to whether or not we
 
06:02:15.948 --> 06:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
are going to get that bill but um for
 
06:02:19.708 --> 06:02:19.718 align:start position:0%
now we've got 31 bills in our
 
06:02:23.190 --> 06:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
committee six of them are early bills um
 
06:02:24.628 --> 06:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
we have
 
06:02:26.910 --> 06:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
heard five of
 
06:02:30.830 --> 06:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
them and we will be hearing one next
 
06:02:34.830 --> 06:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
week and other than that um Madam chair
 
06:02:36.830 --> 06:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
what does vacated to our committee that
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
means that right now that bill was
 
06:02:41.390 --> 06:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
assigned to Commerce because there were
 
06:02:43.030 --> 06:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
a lot lot of language in that bill
 
06:02:45.868 --> 06:02:45.878 align:start position:0%
having to do with retailers and how
 
06:02:48.670 --> 06:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
they put up signage what kind of fees
 
06:02:51.868 --> 06:02:51.878 align:start position:0%
they have to collect and so and so
 
06:02:54.830 --> 06:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
forth vacated to means that it's given
 
06:02:57.510 --> 06:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
to our committee taken out of that
 
06:02:59.628 --> 06:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
committee and given to us yeah I I can
 
06:03:03.708 --> 06:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
just make a quick clarification so if uh
 
06:03:07.708 --> 06:03:07.718 align:start position:0%
if the if a so the the speaker's office
 
06:03:10.310 --> 06:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
assigns uh the bills to various
 
06:03:12.708 --> 06:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
committees based on their best guess of
 
06:03:15.430 --> 06:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
where it should go and sometimes they
 
06:03:19.868 --> 06:03:19.878 align:start position:0%
guess wrong okay and the uh chairs of
 
06:03:22.830 --> 06:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
the committee uh of one committee will
 
06:03:24.948 --> 06:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
say this shouldn't come to our committee
 
06:03:27.110 --> 06:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
and a chair of another committee said
 
06:03:29.150 --> 06:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
that should have come to our committee
 
06:03:33.070 --> 06:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
if those the typical procedure is that
 
06:03:35.070 --> 06:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
if the bill has not been noticed in the
 
06:03:38.468 --> 06:03:38.478 align:start position:0%
calendar those two chairs can agree that
 
06:03:39.948 --> 06:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
they would like to move the bill from
 
06:03:42.910 --> 06:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
one count one committee to another and
 
06:03:45.708 --> 06:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
if the speaker also agrees then that can
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
happen and that process is called
 
06:03:51.350 --> 06:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
vacating uh it seems like this the
 
06:03:53.590 --> 06:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
process did not actually work the way it
 
06:03:55.628 --> 06:03:55.638 align:start position:0%
should have in for this bill there was
 
06:03:58.030 --> 06:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
another bill where Judy and I looked at
 
06:03:59.310 --> 06:03:59.320 align:start position:0%
it and we said this doesn't really
 
06:04:00.750 --> 06:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
belong on our committee this belongs in
 
06:04:03.750 --> 06:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
fishing game and and I had that vacated
 
06:04:05.830 --> 06:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
to fishing game so that was one less on
 
06:04:07.628 --> 06:04:07.638 align:start position:0%
our plate yeah so that and that one went
 
06:04:10.150 --> 06:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
the way it was supposed to
 
06:04:13.310 --> 06:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
right yeah but um I I still have to
 
06:04:15.190 --> 06:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
check back with the uh house clerk to
 
06:04:19.708 --> 06:04:19.718 align:start position:0%
see if they can reverse that um vacating
 
06:04:22.670 --> 06:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
to our committee because um there was a
 
06:04:26.110 --> 06:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
question about it and I raised that with
 
06:04:29.350 --> 06:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
um our house speaker and they said they
 
06:04:31.150 --> 06:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
were going to look at it and I didn't
 
06:04:33.510 --> 06:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
and I and then when I found out that
 
06:04:36.030 --> 06:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
they had scheduled a hearing commas had
 
06:04:39.270 --> 06:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
scheduled a hearing for this Thursday I
 
06:04:40.788 --> 06:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
contacted the speaker's office and I
 
06:04:42.830 --> 06:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
said never mind don't bother you know
 
06:04:44.230 --> 06:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
you've already they've already started
 
06:04:47.150 --> 06:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
working on this so um but then I got a
 
06:04:49.750 --> 06:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
notice this morning that that paint
 
06:04:52.030 --> 06:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
recycling bill was vacated to our
 
06:04:57.310 --> 06:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm like but no
 
06:05:00.468 --> 06:05:00.478 align:start position:0%
no another and one of the reasons that
 
06:05:05.030 --> 06:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
you don't CH do the vacation after uh
 
06:05:06.190 --> 06:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
it's been noticed
 
06:05:08.590 --> 06:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
is there is someone who is coming from
 
06:05:10.868 --> 06:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
California on Thursday to testify on
 
06:05:13.708 --> 06:05:13.718 align:start position:0%
that bill if it gets vacated then that
 
06:05:16.150 --> 06:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
that gets you know that screws up that
 
06:05:19.110 --> 06:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
person who's like coming across the
 
06:05:23.190 --> 06:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
country in order to speak to it so um so
 
06:05:25.430 --> 06:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
it does not make sense if once it's been
 
06:05:29.830 --> 06:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
noticed to uh yeah
 
06:05:32.830 --> 06:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so is this like implementation of
 
06:05:35.070 --> 06:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
the bill because we passed the bill as a
 
06:05:36.990 --> 06:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
for it to be a pilot project I thought
 
06:05:40.990 --> 06:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
no no no no okay so um what we did in
 
06:05:43.510 --> 06:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
this committee we passed the bill
 
06:05:46.910 --> 06:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
unanimously and then it passed the house
 
06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
unanimously and then it went to the
 
06:05:53.350 --> 06:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
Senate and this the senate
 
06:05:56.510 --> 06:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee was leaning in favor of it but
 
06:05:58.590 --> 06:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
they said let's just check with the
 
06:06:00.190 --> 06:06:00.200 align:start position:0%
governor and see if the governor is
 
06:06:02.350 --> 06:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
willing to sign it and the answer came
 
06:06:04.150 --> 06:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
back no the governor wasn't willing to
 
06:06:07.830 --> 06:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
sign it so the SE senate committee uh s
 
06:06:10.070 --> 06:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
it to interim study so that it wouldn't
 
06:06:14.430 --> 06:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
have the blot of a veto on it gotcha so
 
06:06:18.510 --> 06:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
it was back and and actually um paint
 
06:06:21.708 --> 06:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
cares the people who are working on it
 
06:06:24.948 --> 06:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
they were happy to see that it had um
 
06:06:26.590 --> 06:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
been stalled because there was still
 
06:06:29.548 --> 06:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
some work that they needed to do uh with
 
06:06:32.390 --> 06:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative eel so that work is
 
06:06:36.190 --> 06:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
already been put in this current bill so
 
06:06:37.708 --> 06:06:37.718 align:start position:0%
this bill is a better
 
06:06:42.230 --> 06:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill um it's just not it's just in it's
 
06:06:47.270 --> 06:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
not our bill and um so in any case I
 
06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
just wanted to let the committee know
 
06:06:53.150 --> 06:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
that that was happening and um and
 
06:06:55.390 --> 06:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
that's it I guess uh have a have a nice
 
06:06:58.350 --> 06:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
rest of the evening and rest of the week
 
06:07:00.990 --> 06:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
and motion to adjourn so a quick one
 
06:07:03.708 --> 06:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
quick note if uh assuming that it is
 
06:07:05.750 --> 06:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
still going to be on in Commerce do sign
 
06:07:07.590 --> 06:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
