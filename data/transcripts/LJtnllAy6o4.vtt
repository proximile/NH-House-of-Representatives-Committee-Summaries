seeing no objection it will go on
 
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
consent um I'd like to just add now this
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
is the first bill we've done and the
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
person who makes the motion is the
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
person that has the right the committee
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
report we often times call that the
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
blurb and that's oldfashioned language
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of us around here that
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
understand it as the blur I have and we
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
have here in the committee a template
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
which is used to do that with it's a
 
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Word document where it it say
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
The Format is such it comes from our
 
00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant and from the
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
folks upstairs so I'm going to email
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
that to everybody here so you have a
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
copy of this document so if you're
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
making a motion and you're having to get
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
that report language to me you know so
 
00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:05.799 align:start position:0%
that I can read it over and then send it
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
on its way uh to the to the clerk and to
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house for their
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
review then it will be on the same
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
format that we do it in and and it's
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
easy for the administrative system just
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
copy paste what you submit right into
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
the calendar report so that's coming to
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%

question for the chair can a can a bill
 
00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:34.039 align:start position:0%
um such as House Bill two where we 295
 
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
retained in committee could that still
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
be acted on during this first year what
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
we would do is we will hold a building
 
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
Aid Bill one we may have and we see and
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
we have work sessions if we see parts of
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
any one bill which are good you just we
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
amend it to the other so we don't have
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
multiple building Aid Bills going
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
through okay so it still could come out
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
this this the concept yeah or that yeah
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
that language could be parked in another
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
bill terrific thank you yes you're
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
welcome the also the order in which you
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
see these bills coming to you is not for
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
those that are new not necessarily the
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
order which we always we can jump around
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
we're executing bills we can take any
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
particular bill in any order and so the
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
next bill which I will look at order
 
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
right here is HB 354 and I'm not going
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
to bring that bill up for exec today
 
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
seeing I've had communication from the

Department of Education with others
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
there are some potential changes we may
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
have to really filter into this bill
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
before we move forward with it I don't
 
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:39.519 align:start position:0%
like to send forward crummy legislation
 
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that we got all our
 
00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:44.919 align:start position:0%
policy issues dotted eyes dotted and
 
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
te's crossed so we're not going to take
 
00:28:49.509 --> 00:28:49.519 align:start position:0%
action on 354
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%

motion um I think we're all pretty much
 
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with the math learnings
 
00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
community so uh I have nothing further
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
Luna representative Luna all set okay
 
00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
and representative F thank you Mr chair
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
I like to make a
 
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.789 align:start position:0%
I like to make a
motion

00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
yes may I pass it around first so
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
everybody has a
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
copy please take a moment while the
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
copies are being
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
circulated they
 
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:18.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
I'm going to wait till everyone has a
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative Earth uh did you
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
second it yeah let's see well you're
 
00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:35.559 align:start position:0%
you're going to make a motion make your
 
00:32:39.389 --> 00:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
motion um so i' like to move amendment
 
00:32:39.399 --> 00:32:54.990 align:start position:0%
motion um so i' like to move amendment
number

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
so we have a rather
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
tight potentially a budget season coming
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
up and as such this original bill the
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
bill as without the amendment is
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
requesting additional funding for this
 
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
program and given the current situation
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
while I'm support of of both the bill
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the funding as it is um in
 
00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
recognition of the tight uh funding
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
situation I would suggest that we flat
 
00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:36.039 align:start position:0%
fund this uh the same the math learning
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
program um over the next
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
biennium um at this point in time this
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
bill will come back through finance
 
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
committee um specifically division two
 
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
which coincidentally I sit on and at
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
that time we should have a better a
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
clear understanding of our Revenue
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
picture uh as the Ways and Means
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
Committee the house Ways and Means Comm
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
committee will have reported out their
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
expectations for our revenues over the
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
next bium uh and at that point we can
 
00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:05.789 align:start position:0%
next bium uh and at that point we can
consider

00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
whether we have the funds to um go
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
further with
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
thanks second yeah um thank you very
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair yeah I I think a lot of us
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
have heard it's going to be a very
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
difficult um um budget uh uh season this
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
year and I think this is a it's a little
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
bit of a tough Bill tough pill to
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
swallow uh reducing the math learning
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
communities by $100,000 over the um over
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
the bium but uh but I think given the
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
situation before us um uh it makes sense
 
00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:44.919 align:start position:0%
and um and support the amendment thank
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
if I could just clarify uh am I correct
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
U representative Earth the only change
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
that the amendment makes is to adjust
 
00:34:52.119 --> 00:34:52.990 align:start position:0%
that the amendment makes is to adjust
from

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
250,000 to 200,000 for the second year
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
of the banian well just for the second
 
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
so so so pardon me it's $50,000
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
reduction it's 200200 for the two so by
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
leveling I got it right then you said
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
100 it's 100,000 total no because the
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
change the change that the amendment
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
now just a clarify the change that the
 
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
amendment makes to the bill is a net
 
00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.230 align:start position:0%
amendment makes to the bill is a net
$50,000

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
$50,000
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right everyone satisfied and
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
just clarify what that represents that
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
represents the same as the current the
 
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
term we're in now budgeting it's
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
identical very good are there further
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
comments yes i' like to add some further
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
comments on this seeing that as the
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor this bill math learning
 
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
communities this is a very very
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
important bill in in a way for the
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
community college system work closer
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
with our high schools regarding the
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
performance of our high school students
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
in ter terms of mathematics and ensuring
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
that uh the the concepts the principles
 
00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
and all associated with algebra 2 are
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
accomplished and we maybe we change
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
learning styles teaching styles around a
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
little bit to get this done but there's
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
a real healthy uh bill but what we also
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
have be cognizant and the message is
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
going off to those that are in finance
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
right here right now that this bill is
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
not just allocating dollars it's
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
allocating a change in policy so the
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
bill itself is change from what you see
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
underneath that chapter a chapter law
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
right now for the math learning
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
communities program so um to move this
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
you know the amount forward yes you say
 
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
for the math learning communities
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
program but you also have to move
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
forward the policy statements here the
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
structure and organization and how this
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
is presented and how it's worked with
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
those schools in terms of professional
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
development all that that's addressed in
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken under two under
 
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
$10,000 does not have to go on is not
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
required to go onto the regular count
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
that was two under Grand each year of
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
the banum but
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's it it change doesn't change it
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't change from what we've done in
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
previous years I believe it
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
represents new spending for the coming
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
bium and therefore I I yeah yeah okay
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
I'm glad we're taking time to S this out
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
but I do believe therefore it has to go
 
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
on the regular
 
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.950 align:start position:0%
on the regular
calendar

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
yeah all righty back to
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
515 this is an act repealing the Charter
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
Public School eligibility for state
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
school building Aid and like to

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
I'm making a motion of inexpedient to

legislate on HB
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%

second uh represent papovich would you
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion yes Mr
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll be very brief charter
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
schools are public schools there is no
 
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
valid reason to treat them differently
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
in regards to school building Aid this
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
bill suggests that we should treat
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
charter school students as second class
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
citizens it's bad policy and should be
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
rejected thank you R
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
mire I agree further discussion yes
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
represent luno so thanks very much Mr
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
chair um I disagree with the the motion
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
of itl here uh I think there is a very
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
distinct difference between um charter
 
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
schools and public schools uh for
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
example public schools
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
are governed by a publicly elected
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
school board and charter schools are not
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
charter schools are Incorporated in New
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as private non nonprofit
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
corporations public schools are not and
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
over the uh the two decades is that
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
we've had charter schools in New
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've seen something like 20%
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
of them go insolvent due to um Financial
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
mismanagement um uh and fraud so so um I
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
think it would be premature to
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
to invest our limited State resources
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
into um into building aid for for
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools given the fact that they
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
are not the same as public schools and
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
are in fact are very different than
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
public schools uh from uh from both a
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
governance standpoint and from a um from
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh
 
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
and whether or not the state should uh
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
should invest its its money in them it's
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
also very unclear from from uh Charter
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
School founding documents whether any
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
have um have any sort of
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
dissolution uh uh
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
standards that would put the state in a
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
position where it would get its any of
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
its um uh money back should uh should
 
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
another Charter School uh receiving
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
building Aid go belly up thank you
 
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I will also be
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
voting against the itl for the reasons
 
00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
that representative luno uh reported and
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
also although we call them Charter
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
Public Schools they do not have to
 
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
follow statutes in regards to Public
 
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
Schools tools unless it is specifically
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
stated in the statute that Charter is
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
included which I think is a common
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
misconception so they do not have the
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
same standards um I will say they there
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
may well be some very well operating
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
good Charter Schools but overall funding
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure when we have so
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
little we're completely inadequate in
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure funding adding
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
this to it does not make
 
00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
sense further discussion from the
 
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.309 align:start position:0%
sense further discussion from the
committee

00:43:57.309 --> 00:43:57.319 align:start position:0%

accrediting organization at the uh
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
college system uh it was a program set
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
up to where we'd fund these courses
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
at150 bucks a
 
00:48:03.549 --> 00:48:03.559 align:start position:0%
course and we have a a an allow of how
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
many courses one can take in grades 10
 
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
11 or 12 and if a student wants to take
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
more courses Beyond what's in statute
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
it's on the student to pay that
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
difference however what we've seen from
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
this program by having this
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
program rather than having these
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
students take these college courses
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
after they graduate where the cost for
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
the courses which are done during those
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
high school years will save the students
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
and families over $10 million this is a
 
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful savings to those and one of
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
the goals we had in the governor's task
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
force last year was to deal with this
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
issue of affordability and accessibility
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
this program does both of those so I
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
would encourage uh the folks to you know
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
go along with the motion of
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
OTP thank you U representative luno
 
00:48:58.829 --> 00:48:58.839 align:start position:0%
would you like to add any comments no
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
thanks all set representative B
 
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
recognized for an amendment thank you Mr
 
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
chair um I can well let me pass it
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
motions okay again we'll pause while the
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
this back we
 
00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:53.069 align:start position:0%
this back we
right

00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
yeah okay everybody has a copy
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative RSE uh would you make
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
your motion I'd like to make motion
 
00:50:00.559 --> 00:50:03.230 align:start position:0%
your motion I'd like to make motion
2025

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
2025
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
d16h to Bill number HB
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
716 I'll second that seconded by
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative luno and representative F
 
00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:15.799 align:start position:0%
please speak thank you Mr chair so this
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
is the same in the same vein as the
 
00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:20.839 align:start position:0%
previous motion that I made this is
 
00:50:23.309 --> 00:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
another program that's funded outside of
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
CC ccsnh H's budget and it's an ongoing
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
program which I fully support and I
 
00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799 align:start position:0%
fully support the goal of increasing the
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh amount budgeted which is what's in
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
the current bill but again given the
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
current situation I think better wiser
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
if you will to Flat fund this at the
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
same rate as we're in the current bium
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
so that's what this does the $2 and5
 
00:50:50.349 --> 00:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
million per year is the same as the two
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
and half million dollar per year in the
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
very good so the change that the
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
amendment makes to the bill is to reduce
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
by 500,000 in both years of the grip
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
Center Flo yeah thank you Mr chair um I
 
00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
I have a question to to ask and and
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
possibly um um the um the representative
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
from the community college system might
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
um Shannon might have the answer to this
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
but just wondering um in um in going
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
from $3 million a year which is from the
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
bill to2 half million do a year what
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
does that mean for um for students who
 
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
want to take um early college classes I
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
mean are we going to are we going to be
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
limited we you you can feel if it's a a
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
question which is relevant to and we
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
have technical support you can get that
 
00:51:46.789 --> 00:51:46.799 align:start position:0%
technical support okay
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
Shannon if you have something you can
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
add that would be helpful this is good
 
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
Youk thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
Shannon good morning thank you for the
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
question I'm Shannon Reed with the
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
 
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um first of all I appreciate
 
00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
the committee's consideration of of flat
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
funding this at this stage in order to
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
you know keep it moving forward
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that division 2 will
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
probably have a um more um a look at it
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
later in the process when perhaps more
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
is known about Revenue But to answer
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
your question I I think that certainly
 
00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
um there's a potential that this would
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
limit enrollment or at least limit the
 
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
the number of courses that are funded
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
through the state students can certain
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
take more at their own expense um but
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
again um we we do what we stretch that
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation as much as we can and um
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
we certainly hope that as the process
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
evolves through the rest of the session
 
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
that we may have a chance to revisit the
 
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.510 align:start position:0%
that we may have a chance to revisit the
total

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
total
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
amount so so just a just a followup on
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
that yes follow yeah thank you very much
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you very much shann
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
um so so when when cutting half when
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
reducing half a million so bringing it
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
back to um to what what what what we
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
currently have um funded so $500,000 in
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
in each year and courses at Community
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
colleg I I think are around are they
 
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
still 215 a
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
credit and so a two or three credit
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
course would be around a
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
$650 thing minus the 150 that the
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
student pays leaves 500
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
so reducing it by $500,000 would
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
potentially limit a th000 students from
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
taking a three credit so that's a that's
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
pretty fast math for me sitting up here
 
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
um is that generally how the math works
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
for this we offer these courses to high
 
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
school students at a discount already
 
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
they're $150 per course so I I don't
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
think that the calculation you laid out
 
00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
is quite what we'd see um this the
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
course the cost of the students is $150
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
the program picks up that cost covers
 
00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
that cost but if the students have to
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
take additional courses they're still
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
paying $150 they're not paying the full
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
cost that they would if they were um
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
college students yeah so I'm missing
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
something on that so the programs
 
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
picking up the 15 or the programs
 
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
picking up the difference between what
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
the student pays the 150 and what the
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
community colleges would normally charge
 
00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
our agreement in the statute is that we
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
charge for the courses that are offered
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the high schools we charge 100 $50
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
right regardless of the funding source
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
so this program with the
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
funding pays the $150 tuition cost that
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
the students would pay but if the
 
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
students have to take a course without
 
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
the funding from the state they would
 
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
still pay $150 does that answer question
 
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
it's a little different M only goes
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
towards so there's really no cost to the
 
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
student right there no cost to the
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
student of courses that are covered by
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
the by the program there's no cost to
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
you okay representative glad would you
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
like to add to that yeah I'd like to
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
just CL thank you very much Mr clarify
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
some of this discussion the the cost
 
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
which we're looking at if you were out
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
of college or out of high school would
 
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
be up at a level like that but because
 
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
we negotiated back Years with Ross catel
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
who at that time was the chancellor and
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
this is why you don't see the university
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
system as part of that at that time
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
Chancellor leech was not willing to go
 
00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
along with the 150 but the Community
 
00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
College saw the gains that in the
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
affordability issues with students
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
accepted it and that's where we're we
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're held to that right now the other
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
issue which we have is that since we put
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
this program in place for grades 11 and
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
12 initially it's been expanded to
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
grades 10 11 and 12
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
that then now says oh there's more
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
students involved in the program and we
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
have had legislation where it's up to
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
four courses but then we couldn't offer
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
four courses to every kid that was
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
wanting to take the four courses simply
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
because we had more kids in the program
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
and so we had to cut it back and up to
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
well up to went to about two courses or
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
thereabouts as I recall Shannon so um
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
the the $3 million is an effort to try
 
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
to move to have uh be able to afford in
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
in appropriate dollars which would meet
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
all those students potentially that
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
would be wanting to take concurrent and
 
00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment uh however this is the
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
figure which is uh seen by in the budget
 
00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
from the previous year and with the
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
hardship we have uh as as the community
 
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
college system has mentioned as
 
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
represent F has mentioned this moves it
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
forward and I'm hoping that if you see
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
any additional dollars that are are
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
available at the division 2 level or
 
00:57:01.029 --> 00:57:01.039 align:start position:0%
Finance level that this be one of those
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
areas that we see as a real priority
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
issue and and that was a it's coming
 
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
forth as a result of the governor's task
 
00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
force and hp1 1450 which we passed last
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
year thank
 
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Damon thank you
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so my remarks
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
are coming from my experience as a
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
person person who benefited from a very
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
similar program in another another state
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
when I was in high
 
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.470 align:start position:0%
when I was in high
school

00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
and making college courses affordable
 
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
and accessible especially to students
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
who might not have the confidence to
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
believe that they were higher ed
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
material is incredibly value valuable I
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
think it also is marketing our New
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire higher education
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
systems and potentially therefore down
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
the line keeping kids in New Hampshire
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
as part of our
 
00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:03.799 align:start position:0%
Workforce so my question is to the
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
colleagues here on this committee who
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
are also in
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
finance I'm worried that respecting our
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal challenges this
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
year if we pass this amendment what is
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
the probability that finance will rather
 
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
than increasing it reduce it
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
further have we already negotiated down
 
00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:26.359 align:start position:0%
or to I know you can't make promises but
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
i' just like to hear some thoughts on
 
00:58:30.119 --> 00:58:32.109 align:start position:0%
i' just like to hear some thoughts on
that

00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
representative um I can't give you odds
 
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
at this point since we don't even have a
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
Topline number uh you know in worst case
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
as I explained to um ccsnh and also to
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
UNH there's a possibility of cutting
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
their funding not just this but the
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
actual funding to the to the to
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
universities so until we really have
 
00:58:57.309 --> 00:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
those numbers some ways and means so
 
00:58:59.029 --> 00:58:59.039 align:start position:0%
that we know what it is we're shooting
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
for it's really hard I mean obviously I
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
really I'm very sport of of both these
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
programs just when in the math learning
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
program they're excellent programs as
 
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
everybody here has has stated and
 
00:59:10.589 --> 00:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
certainly if we have extra funds it
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be much of a stretch to add
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
both of these um back in but at this
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
point we really don't have any idea
 
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
other than we've seen um revenues going
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
going down to date um we haven't got we
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
don't even have the governor's numbers
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
at this point in terms of what she's
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
projecting for
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
um for a budget um but certainly I'm
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
very supportive and I think in general
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
our committee certainly our subcommittee
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
is very supportive and and I think in
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
general the finance committee is very
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
supportive of both these programs as
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
representative lad has
 
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
stated representative Pap P Miller a
 
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
very brief addition besides obviously
 
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
agreeing with everything that was just
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
said if you look at the track history of
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
division 2 and ccsnh I think that you'll
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
find that we greatly value their
 
00:59:57.029 --> 00:59:57.039 align:start position:0%
contributions and we find them to be a
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know great addition to everything we
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
can do in the state and we will do
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
everything that we can to fund this you
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
know ideally to the original levels it's
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
just at this point in time that's not
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
something we could promise thank you I
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
have one last comment and representative
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
flad um yeah we talk about accessibility
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
and affordability but we also have
 
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
another term
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
transferability and the what we're
 
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
seeing as a result of this program more
 
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
students are getting involved in this
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
type of program at the high school level
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
once they're hooked and they take the
 
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
bait they are now going to potentially
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
go on through the college systems and
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
the university system because these
 
01:00:45.549 --> 01:00:45.559 align:start position:0%
courses are transferable not to every uh
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh program at let's say UNH or Keen or
 
01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:51.039 align:start position:0%
Plymouth however we have over a 100
 
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
Pathways now that we have worked on in
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
1530 which was a bill which
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
drove the point across that we want a
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
student taking a course at this level
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
and having some kind of a guarantee that
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
it's going to apply to later on so they
 
01:01:08.029 --> 01:01:08.039 align:start position:0%
don't have to take you know another
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
course to do what they already have done
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's a costly Affair so there's a lot
 
01:01:16.349 --> 01:01:16.359 align:start position:0%
lot to this and it there's also
 
01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
potentially Workforce issues as a result
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
60% of our high school grads we're going
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
outside this state for Education if we
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
can hook them up in the community
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
college system that is the key and
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
that's what Chancellor Rubenstein is
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
trying to drive home and so I would
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
encourage if there's any Buck anywhere
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
and I I know you the finance people are
 
01:01:39.789 --> 01:01:39.799 align:start position:0%
here they're hearing it and they've
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
always been positive towards the
 
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
community college system so thank you
 
01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.309 align:start position:0%
community college system so thank you
very

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
Ames this has been a great discussion
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
and uh helpful to me as I've learned
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
more about this program I think that uh
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing a consensus that uh we we
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
prefer not to be be reducing this number
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
in the text of this bill but um given
 
01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
the circumstances it's a prudent thing
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
to do um I hope that the report on our
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
action makes clear that if the money is
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
available at the time of the uh budget
 
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
making process that uh this would be one
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
of the first uh to get returned to the
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
number uh in this original
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative Ames well
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
the sentiment certainly seems um
 
01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
broad um and I think we can we can amend
 
01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:50.599 align:start position:0%
the bill and still report it out
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically okay seeing no further

report but I'd be happy to write it if
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
you'd like to but how about we declare
 
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
the result of this so
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
yeah the vote being 18 to0 uh the otpa
 
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
motion on HB
 
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
716 as amended is passed and and I
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
taking the gamble back the report has
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
already been written and uh along with
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
the other two that I had and there's a
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
little caveat in it saying exactly what
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
we want to state that we are love with
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
you 10 minute break we have a 10-minute
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
break and it's good idea everybody get
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
up and stretch your legs and if you have
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
to walk down the hallway do it now okay
 
01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
so that one goes on a regular yes two
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
that exactly you're the one that's
 
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
righten all the and they're already
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
written now we got just get pop it is

me here I am representative Lind gold of
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
bford New Hampshire and I am proposing
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
this bill for school funding because I
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
believe that it is the duty of the
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
legislature to deal with fiscal matters
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
in the state and not the Judiciary
 
01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
Branch so that is where why this bill is
 
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
being promoted by me I shall present
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
some of the findings that bring about
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
the need for this bill part two article
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
83 of the New Hampshire Constitution
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%

01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see I'm very passionate about um
 
01:24:43.709 --> 01:24:43.719 align:start position:0%
having more funding for our
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
students um good good morning my name is
 
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
Donna magon and I serve as a
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the Newport School
 
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
District education is the foundation
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
upon which opportunity is built
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
yet our ability to provide an adequate
 
01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
education is under significant strain as
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
a leader of a district that serves 751
 
01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
students I see the daily challenges we
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
Face due to Staffing short shortages and
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
the increase in the needs of our
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
students at present we are short 14
 
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
teachers and 27 of our 83 educators are
 
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
working under an alternative plan
 
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
meaning that they are not fully
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
certified in their assigned
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
roles this has a direct impact on the
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
qual a direct excuse me this has a
 
01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
direct impact on the quality and
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
consistency of instruction on our
 
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
students Beyond Staffing concerns nearly
 
01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
half of our population 327 students
 
01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
require an individualized education
 
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
support of these
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
29% have an IEP
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
plan 15% are on a 504 plan plan and 16
 
01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
students are English language Learners
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
and I would also like to add that just
 
01:25:57.149 --> 01:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
this morning we had two more students
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
that are looking to enroll that are
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
students this these students are
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
specialized instruction targeted
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
resource and trained professionals who
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
can meet their diverse learning needs
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
the increased complexity of our
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
classrooms only add to the demand placed
 
01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
on our already stressed
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
Educators ensuring adequate education
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
requires more than good intention it
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
requires proper funding without
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
significant financial support we cannot
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
attract and retain quality te teachers
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
nor can we provide the critical services
 
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
our students
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
need the consequences of underfunding
 
01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
are far-reaching affecting not only
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
graduation rates and career Readiness
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
but also the long-term economical health
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
community I do not make this request
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
lightly but today I am asking or
 
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
pleading for your support
 
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
our students are not just statistics
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
they are the future of our town and they
 
01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
deserve better investing in education
 
01:27:05.149 --> 01:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
means investing in a strong Workforce a
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
more engaged public and a a thriving
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
community on Saturday our school
 
01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
district's operating budget passed at
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
our deliberative session however our
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
financial concerns remain pressing after
 
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
the March vote we will need to identify
 
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.470 align:start position:0%
the March vote we will need to identify

01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:25.480 align:start position:0%

394,161

01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
48,49 that is
 
01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:53.109 align:start position:0%
48,49 that is
only

01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
264,000 they are necessary commitments
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
so these would be any obligations that
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
we had um contracts or so forth um so
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
that that's why our budget is only
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
changed the
 
01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.750 align:start position:0%
changed the
$264,300

01:28:06.750 --> 01:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
$264,300
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
that is why I Ur am urging you to
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 769 which seeks to
 
01:28:13.709 --> 01:28:13.719 align:start position:0%
increase the base cost of providing the
 
01:28:16.030 --> 01:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
and changes the Statewide education
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
property tax without this essential
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
funding our ability to meet these
 
01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
obligations while providing a quality
 
01:28:27.550 --> 01:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
education will be in Jeopardy this is a
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
this is a pivotal moment we cannot
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
afford to Short change our students I
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
ask you to take action and support House
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
Bill 769 for our children for our school
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
for our future and for our community
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh questions for Miss mcum yes represent
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
you very much superintendent for uh for
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
joining us again um in your in your in
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
your remarks just now you concluded
 
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
saying we can't afford to short short
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
change our children and and um and I
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
certainly felt that way you know um
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
during my you know 12 years on the
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
Hopton school board but you don't have
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
to go very far up the road to get to
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
Newport and um and with with very very
 
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
different student outcomes uh in Newport
 
01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
and I think largely because of school
 
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
funding but I was wondering if you could
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
talk about some of those outcomes um
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
particularly in light of the the recent
 
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
um nape U uh scores that have been
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
released and I know they were just
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
released in the last handful of days so
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
right right so we haven't really had a
 
01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:37.719 align:start position:0%
chance to to dive into it because we've
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
been moving forward budget right because
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
budget right now is is in the Forefront
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
um but what I can tell you is so if I
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
look at last year compared to this year
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
last year I had three fifth grade
 
01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
classrooms this year I have two I have
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
25 to 26 child children in class
 
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
now um you know when I had taught back
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know back many many years ago when I
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
taught it wouldn't be unnatural for a
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
teacher to have you know about 20
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
students in the class but things have
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
changed right we now are we now have we
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
can't segregate our children right so
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
we're putting all children in class
 
01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
together now so that's causing some
 
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
major issues in the classroom right so
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
we have children that are throwing desks
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
we you know chairs and we have children
 
01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
that are throwing things we're having to
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know move children out of rooms
 
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
that's paying a huge toll on the
 
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
academic outcomes of all of our students
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
right not to mention the the stress that
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
the kids have to go through seeing this
 
01:30:37.870 --> 01:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
type of of behavior we are hiring staff
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
that are are brand spanking new and some
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
haven't even gone through the education
 
01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
track in schools right so they're coming
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
to us and it may be for instance we may
 
01:30:49.709 --> 01:30:49.719 align:start position:0%
have someone that had a business degree
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
that decides oh I'd like to teach math
 
01:30:54.109 --> 01:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
and so now they're coming into our our
 
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:55.719 align:start position:0%
building and we're we're training them
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
how to teach math but they've never had
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
the experience of student teaching so
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
they don't have that aspects of being in
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
the classroom so that's really paying a
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
role uh you know toll on our students um
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that our staff is not
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
good by any means our staff is
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
incredible the things that they put up
 
01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
with on a daily basis right they're now
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
um having to be a guidance counselor
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
right because we have so many kids with
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
trauma in our classrooms uh last last
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
week I want to say I had
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
um 4 68 probably about 10 to 12 dcyf
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
reports that were handed to me and we
 
01:31:31.109 --> 01:31:31.119 align:start position:0%
had probably three I think three
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
students taken away from their families
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
so we have a lot that's going on in
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
Newport that you don't find in a lot of
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
other areas right which pay a to that
 
01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
plays a toll in in the education of our
 
01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
students and so I think it's all of that
 
01:31:44.189 --> 01:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
put together right it's the behavior
 
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
it's the larger class sizes it's not
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
having the experience in the classroom
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of students a lot of
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
students that their parents may have
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
went to Newport and they don't trust the
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
school system and so we're having to try
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
to work with them but when you're having
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
a new teacher every year the teachers
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
can't build this teachers can't build
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
that relationship with the parents so
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
all of this is paying playing a a huge
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
role in on the Newport School District
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
So currently we are trying in our budget
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
we are trying to get raises for our our
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
staff but it's not nearly enough is what
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
people are making just down the road for
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
us right and it's and some people say
 
01:32:23.229 --> 01:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
it's much easier just to drive down the
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
road and not have to deal with some of
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
the behaviors that you're dealing with
 
01:32:27.629 --> 01:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
in Newport right it really takes
 
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
somebody special to to work in Newport
 
01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
and stay in Newport I hope I answered
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
your question thank you very much
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
represent spillsbury
 
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
welcome again miss mcon thank you um so
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
the bill changes the swept concept from
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
a fixed 363
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
million which effectively has uh a
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
Statewide rate of 1.12
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
and of course that varies then District
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
or town to town depending on equalized
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
valuation and the bill converts that
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
into a fixed rate
 
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719 align:start position:0%
2.5 uh it's hard to know how exactly
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
that would play out in Newport but if
 
01:33:15.629 --> 01:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to increase the amount
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
raised Statewide from 363 million to
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
8811 million more or
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
less how do you think that particular
 
01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
approach would play uh with the uh
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
people who live in
 
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
Newport I think it would be helpful
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
right because what we look at is
 
01:33:37.109 --> 01:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
anything that we could provide to help
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
with our community offset tax rates is
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
going to be very helpful for our
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
community we have a um large community
 
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
of um elder population that are
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
suffering because of the cost to them
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
most of the cost comes from our
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so I think if we could offset
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
it more and most of our cost comes from
 
01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
the state or this from the school
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
district part then um we're not having
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
to go after our community so I think
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
that any little bit that comes in is
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
very helpful for our
 
01:34:08.189 --> 01:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
community yeah followup followup please
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean what swep will do is
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
apply to the property tax right the
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
state portion of the property tax so I I
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
would guess that the only way in which
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
that becomes a net benefit
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
to uh the taxpayers of Newport is if the
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
state then
 
01:34:33.149 --> 01:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
reallocates that
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
um uh that money um through
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy but if if the base adequacy is
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
raised to the 7,000 Uh I that that
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
number down to the penny always throws
 
01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.590 align:start position:0%
number down to the penny always throws
me

01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
$735 And1
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
01:34:57.390 --> 01:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really reallocate anything
 
01:34:59.709 --> 01:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
because it goes to every student across
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
equally which I think it should right I
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
think it needs that's why it' be fair
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
and Equitable right I think that every
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
student is entitled to um their fair
 
01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
share and every district is entitled to
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
what what the needs are of their
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
Community I'll leave it there I guess
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
I'm also concerned in terms of uh how it
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%

01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing thank you very much
 
01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very

01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
Ying good morning welcome thank you

chairman lad and members of the
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative G for
 
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:53.800 align:start position:0%

hopkington New Hampshire and along with
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
Michael Tierney I represented the 18
 
01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
school districts uh that brought the
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
suit in conval versus
 
01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
State those 18 school districts are
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative or are I'm sorry are
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
collectively responsible for educating
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
more than a quarter of New Hampshire's
 
01:36:14.669 --> 01:36:14.679 align:start position:0%
public school
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
students and as any of you who have met
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
a attorney Tierney no he would much
 
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
rather have sent himself than me today
 
01:36:26.189 --> 01:36:26.199 align:start position:0%
uh and he does send his
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
regrets while we served as trial Council
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
for those 18 school districts I am here
 
01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
on my own behalf and not on behalf of
 
01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
any District taxpayer or student and I'm
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
here in support of HB
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
769 the bill is pretty straightforward
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
as you've noted it increases the amount
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
of Base adequacy to $
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
7,356 And1 per
 
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
student which is the absolute bare
 
01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
minimum amount necessary to educate a
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
child in conformance with part two
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
article 83 of the New Hampshire
 
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution base adequacy which is the
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
amount set forth in subsection 2A of
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
1984a is the amount of money that it
 
01:37:14.109 --> 01:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
takes to educate the least costly to
 
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
educate child in the
 
01:37:18.270 --> 01:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
state this bill does not address
 
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid categories like
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
special education or programs like
 
01:37:23.119 --> 01:37:24.430 align:start position:0%
special education or programs like
building

01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
Aid in the real world there are
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
constraints on efficiency that mean that
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
the actual base cost of educating the
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
least costly to educate student is
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
probably closer to $10,000 per people
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
but in conal the Superior Court found
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
that in a hypothetically perfectly
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
efficient District the base cost could
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
be no less than
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
$735 And1 per
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
student I do have copies of that
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
decision if any of you haven't read it
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
yet and would like a
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
copy to your question earlier
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative luno HB 769 increases
 
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue by increasing swept from the
 
01:38:07.719 --> 01:38:08.550 align:start position:0%
Revenue by increasing swept from the
current

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
$112 per thousand to $2.50 per thousand
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
and at that rate $2.50 per thousand
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
swept would still be less of 40 less
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
than 40% of what it was in 1999
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh finally I just want to note with all
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
due respect that I believe there might
 
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
be an error in the fiscal note based on
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.270 align:start position:0%
 
151,939

01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
151,939
 
01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
37 for each of those students is an
 
01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
increase of approximately 470 million I
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
was unable to confirm whether charter
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
school and EFA students were included in
 
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
151,953

01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:11.550 align:start position:0%
 
m777

01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
m777
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
to30 to ensure that the state is
 
01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
providing the adequate education that
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
our constitution guarantees I ask that
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
the committee recommend adoption of HB
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
769 and I'm happy to answer any
 
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
questions the best of liability thank
 
01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
you very much other questions from the
 
01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
um Revenue Administration are you
 
01:39:37.229 --> 01:39:37.239 align:start position:0%
willing to offer some technical support
 
01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
to us in this
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
up I you know you handed a sheet here
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to have you try to explain
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
some of the things within it but I'm
 
01:39:58.990 --> 01:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
noticing in it that the the increase in
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
the swep will net
 
01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.470 align:start position:0%
the swep will net
$811

01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
$811
 
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
approximately in Revenue which is kept
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
locally my question therefore is is this
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
the way we're going to really help uh
 
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
the property towns by Distributing
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
limited revenues or are we now putting
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
more money into towns which are going to
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
really build build up a huge savings
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
account from
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
this um chairman lad I'm not
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
sure how to address that question um I
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
know that if and as the that guide that
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
I we handed out mentioned this was just
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
take um the most recent uh swept
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
calculations and change that rate to
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
$22.50 per thousand and and that would
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
generate would have as it the note said
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
approximately $800 I think gu 11
 
01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.390 align:start position:0%
approximately $800 I think gu 11
million

01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
um from our
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
perspective everything else is the same
 
01:41:12.189 --> 01:41:12.199 align:start position:0%
at that point the $811 million would be
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
a portioned based on those equalized
 
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
values um so the math in this it's a
 
01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
hypothetical but the math is pretty
 
01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
straightforward so whatever a
 
01:41:29.229 --> 01:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
municipality saw the warrant to raise
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
$112 it would be if if we're just
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
generalizing it was wasn't 148%
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
higher those are the dollars then that
 
01:41:43.589 --> 01:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
would be used to calculate the local
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
school rate so in representative
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
spilsbury's example if you're in
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
Newport you would be expected the town
 
01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
would be expected to raise for the
 
01:41:55.239 --> 01:41:57.189 align:start position:0%
would be expected to raise for the
school

01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
district I don't have newport's number
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
in mind but at 148% increase it should
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
be two and a half times the dollars I
 
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.510 align:start position:0%
be two and a half times the dollars I
believe

01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:42:12.189 --> 01:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
so that's all I can really speak to as
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
to what that does and again as we read
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
the the bill is not attempting to change
 
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
anything else and I I'll leave adequacy
 
01:42:23.229 --> 01:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
to my colleague at education to discuss
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
those and the implications and for
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
adequacy to to swept amounts but the
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
swept would
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
be we would do the same calculations
 
01:42:35.310 --> 01:42:35.320 align:start position:0%
except we'd use
 
01:42:38.669 --> 01:42:38.679 align:start position:0%
250 and then we'd a portion the 811
 
01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
million and we would determine the local
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
school rate each fall based on on those
 
01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
warrants and again we don't get involved
 
01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
after that point I know that the a
 
01:42:54.189 --> 01:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
municipality will raise that through the
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
property taxes and um I'm pretty certain
 
01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:02.119 align:start position:0%
it combines it uh the swept dollars with
 
01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
the local um School rate itself and
 
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
those funds move to the school district
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you represent spilsbury and then
 
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
represent luno thank you Mr chair so
 
01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
given that all of the swept collected
 
01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
stays in the municipality under current
 
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
law there is no reallocation going on in
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
terms of how the money gets reshuffled
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
the only allocation you're talking about
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:43:33.149 --> 01:43:33.159 align:start position:0%
determination based on the equalized
 
01:43:36.589 --> 01:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
valuation adjustment to the dollar 12
 
01:43:39.149 --> 01:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
correct Statewide average
 
01:43:42.669 --> 01:43:42.679 align:start position:0%
yeah can you tell us roughly what is the
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
dispersion around that mean in the rates
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
that actually are applied in the various
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities um from a low to a high I
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
cannot I've never conducted such an
 
01:43:57.470 --> 01:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
analysis pretty dramatic isn't it like
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
maybe a factor of um
 
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
1.5 I repres I'm going to decline to
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
comment because I've never done that
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
analysis so I don't want to use words
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
like large or small I do not know I know
 
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
that they're not identical and I don't
 
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
want to put words in your mouth and I
 
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
don't recall specifically but off the
 
01:44:18.109 --> 01:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
top of my head I think that individual
 
01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
communities can end up with a swept rate
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
today as much as around 1.65 depending
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
on what the equalized valuation
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
adjustment does to the 112
 
01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.229 align:start position:0%
adjustment does to the 112
average

01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
average
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
so yeah it in other words for those who
 
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
might imagine that this bill results in
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
further redistribution amongst
 
01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities um the bill as it's
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
written would not actually achieve
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
that yeah the only distribution you
 
01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned is what we do every year which
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
is to take the amount of taxes which for
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years has been set at $363
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
million or the closest we can get it
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
over um and then a portioned to the
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
259 municipalities based on equalized
 
01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:13.550 align:start position:0%
259 municipalities based on equalized
value

01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
value
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you pran luno so thanks thanks
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and thank you very
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
much Mr canu for for joining us again um
 
01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
and I I want to sort of drill drill down
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
on on what Representatives lad and
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
spillsbury were were just talking about
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
and um and just sort of you know take
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
this into a a you know real situation
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
we've been talking with with the
 
01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent from Newport about um
 
01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
about Newport and about the challenges
 
01:45:47.310 --> 01:45:47.320 align:start position:0%
they have there and so um so uh there's
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
another um there's another town in New
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that also begins with new and
 
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
it's called new capap
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
and under the current um under current
 
01:46:01.149 --> 01:46:01.159 align:start position:0%
law with swept at a buck 12 buck
 
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
12,000 um Newcastle Nets almost
 
01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
$40,000 per um per student that's
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
correct and um and so by increasing so
 
01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is would would
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
increasing swept from a buck 12 per
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
th000 to
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
250 um uh per per th000 more than
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
doubling it wouldn't that net Newcastle
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
over 85 maybe
 
01:46:34.109 --> 01:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
$90,000 per per
 
01:46:36.510 --> 01:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
student never done that calculation
 
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
either representative it's just not part
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
of our methodology so um I think my
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
colleague at education would answer that
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
one very quickly but the number of
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
dollars I'm going to generalize here
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
because I don't have the figures in
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
front of me but if the swept rate was
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
$2.50 per thousand this this last year
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
and we had done it and everybody's Val
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation is
 
01:47:06.669 --> 01:47:06.679 align:start position:0%
identical I think you can just take that
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
increase and and use it for every single
 
01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
community so I'm making this up I
 
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
because I don't know if newport's swept
 
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
warrant said raise half a million
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
dollars then the local swept rate in
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
Newport would have been set by us to do
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
just that at a112 for the the Statewide
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
if it was
 
01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
250 um it's going to create 811 million
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
a portion right it's going to just
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
simply change the Newport swept rate
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
applied in Newport from whatever it
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
was to something higher right so so
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
quick followup so so so if you're a if
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
you're um uh if you're a city or town
 
01:48:00.189 --> 01:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
with with low property values given the
 
01:48:02.589 --> 01:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
the number of students that they have
 
01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
but you know a town with with lower
 
01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
property values um that will net you
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
less than a town with substantially
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
higher property values like like a
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
Newcastle so so um so it would it yes it
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
it would it would I think what I'm
 
01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
hearing you saying is that yes it would
 
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
net Newport
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
more maybe double what they're what
 
01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
they're netting right now per student
 
01:48:33.310 --> 01:48:33.320 align:start position:0%
but for places with substantially higher
 
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
property values it will also net them
 
01:48:38.669 --> 01:48:38.679 align:start position:0%
more too and and you know those doll
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
those differences in dollars you know it
 
01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
might net Newport another million
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
dollars but it you know but it'll it
 
01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
could not the the way the tax is is
 
01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.070 align:start position:0%
could not the the way the tax is is
currently

01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
structured New Ports going to raise its
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
share of the 8811
 
01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
million and again as it's structured
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
that share whatever that dollar amount
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
is is staying in Newport moving through
 
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
the town to the school
 
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
district and so
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
it in this
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
analysis nothing's changing except for
 
01:49:20.669 --> 01:49:20.679 align:start position:0%
the amount of tax dollars being raised
 
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
in each of the 259
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities UND
 
01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
swept they would all go
 
01:49:31.470 --> 01:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
up and I suspect I think if I'm right
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
the math is they'd all go up by
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
148% the
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
dollars great thanks very much you're
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
welcome further questions from the
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
committee yes representa Damon thank you
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
question so is it correct then to
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
understand that this
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
proposal to increase the swept
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
rate does not in any way lower local
 
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
property taxes since the swept is
 
01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
collected and kept in communities it's
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
just another version of the local
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
property tax it's a distinct tax it is
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's the state
 
01:50:14.159 --> 01:50:16.070 align:start position:0%
it's the state
tax

01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
um holding all other variables
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
steady if you raise more tax dollar via
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
the swept tax rate in each
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
municipality then those are more
 
01:50:32.589 --> 01:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
property taxes in and of
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
themselves thank you you're welcome any
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much you're
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
welcome chairman L I forgot to identify
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
myself but I hope I was going to suggest
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
a pink card
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
but well I don't know if the clerk needs
 
01:50:50.589 --> 01:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
anything that's what we'll we'll need
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
you might introduce yourself right now
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
because youve been for our committee
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
before but there's new folks here so
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
sure uh my name is Bruce canu I'm the
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the municipal Bureau which
 
01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
functions under the municipal and
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
property division of the Department of
 
01:51:10.109 --> 01:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue thank you Bruce you're welcome
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
and and if you could get the a pin card
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
back where Jen is right there and fill
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
that out we'll put that as part of the
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
record as where you gave technical
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
support and we also have a copy of your
 
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair was there a fiscal did we
 
01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0%
get a fiscal note from LBA on
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
this Ju Just the notes from the Dr yeah
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
just the quick guide
 
01:51:42.189 --> 01:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
okay no we've done
 
01:51:42.199 --> 01:51:44.550 align:start position:0%
okay no we've done
that

01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:47.229 --> 01:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
well we we didn't get a revised fiscal
 
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
note though from LBA no it just as
 
01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:50.870 align:start position:0%
note though from LBA no it just as
introduced

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
here um do you have is there something
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
else came through here though I haven't
 
01:51:58.750 --> 01:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
seen it as introduced it was simply
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
saying that they were unable to complete
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
right and I haven't seen an update right
 
01:52:03.870 --> 01:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
so this is another one that we want to
 
01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:08.030 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:18.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be
 
01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
great Rick said okay yeah I've got in
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
fact mine is revised January 28th here
 
01:52:35.069 --> 01:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
rest okay so the next bill which we have
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be starting right now so
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm the presenter in that so I'm
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
going to remove myself from here and
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:29.709 --> 01:53:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'll begin by uh recognizing
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative lad Prime sponsor to
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:40.589 --> 01:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
01:53:42.270 --> 01:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
members of the education funding
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee I'm here today to introduce uh
 
01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:46.510 align:start position:0%
committee I'm here today to introduce uh
HB

01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
773 uh my name is Rick lad I come from
 
01:53:51.069 --> 01:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
hail New
 
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and represent a number of
 
01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
communities up in the Upper Valley area
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
um this bill has been
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
introduced uh similar to a bill that I
 
01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
introduced back in
 
01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
2013 with representative guile uh it's
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
in reaction to uh the special education
 
01:54:17.229 --> 01:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
Aid and the pration amount that is
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
occurring as you all know we've T
 
01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
discussed it several times here that we
 
01:54:23.229 --> 01:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
initially appropriate in the budget for
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
the special education Aid once called
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid $34
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
million and when we come out now with
 
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
the actual costs and all that's occurred
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
doe said no it's closer to
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
51.6 whatever million dollar there's a
 
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
$17 million gap and in current
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
legislation as you look at this bill you
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
can see on the bottom of the page the
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
first page there on line
 
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
29 um it says the Department of
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
Education shall distribute to the school
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
district not less than 85% of the
 
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
district's entitlement for catastrophic
 
01:55:01.149 --> 01:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
Aid costs in the first in the fisal year
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
and we know that the the district has to
 
01:55:07.069 --> 01:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
cough up first approximately $70,000 for
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
before the state even gets engaged after
 
01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
the three and a half times up to the 10
 
01:55:13.390 --> 01:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
times and then uh and then it's a 2080
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
split and then and and ratio and and
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
then uh once you get above 10 times it's
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
on on the state totally so the district
 
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
has to account for initially about $96
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
million when we have something like this
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
has occurred where there's not money
 
01:55:33.550 --> 01:55:33.560 align:start position:0%
there in the budget to support what the
 
01:55:36.830 --> 01:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
actual costs are then this bill this
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
legislation in this chapter of law
 
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
allows the the uh amount to be that's
 
01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
due to the communities that have spent
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
the money to prate that down to fit that
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
$34 million figure so they have to PR
 
01:55:54.510 --> 01:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
rate that out and so they're going to
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
charge to all the districts a certain
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
percentage and this year it's been
 
01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
67% 67% of what they are expecting to
 
01:56:07.870 --> 01:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
see and this bill would say the pration
 
01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
rate can go no lower than
 
01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
85% that's a similar figure that
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
represented gu and I put in back in 2013
 
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
recognizing this does occur not every
 
01:56:21.629 --> 01:56:21.639 align:start position:0%
year uh in fact in in the past several
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
years it's been
 
01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
that it's been a higher percentage level
 
01:56:27.390 --> 01:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
much much much higher but we're down now
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
in one of those dips again where back
 
01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
then we were also in the 60% range and
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
it was pretty untenable uh when a school
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
district's looking for these dollars to
 
01:56:40.069 --> 01:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
come in and it doesn't then you have to
 
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
start uh borrowing from Paul to pay
 
01:56:44.830 --> 01:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
Peter other words looking at the rest of
 
01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
the operating budget if there's any
 
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
money's there you're subtracting from
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
programs um you're also uh maybe having
 
01:56:53.470 --> 01:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
to have a special meeting to appropriate
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
dollars at the local level or you have
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
have you're going to have to do
 
01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:00.040 align:start position:0%
something a tax ant anticipation note or
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
something to try to come up with those
 
01:57:04.589 --> 01:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
dollars which you need to pay these
 
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
expenses so this is just one part of of
 
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
the special education uh area that we
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
need to look at uh there's other areas
 
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
where this says three and a half times
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at two and a half
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
times we' been looking at three times
 
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of the average preo cost
 
01:57:25.709 --> 01:57:25.719 align:start position:0%
I I'm suggesting that this is just one
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
component but it's a component that has
 
01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
been dealt with in the past and it was
 
01:57:31.870 --> 01:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
rejected back in
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
2013 and um here we are again with the
 
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
same the same bill coming forward thank
 
01:57:39.550 --> 01:57:39.560 align:start position:0%
you very much and I'll be glad to take
 
01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:42.030 align:start position:0%
you very much and I'll be glad to take
any

01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
questions just I'd like to begin with
 
01:57:46.030 --> 01:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
two quick clarifying questions regarding
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
your intent so 85% is your intention um
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
as as a a minimum yeah
 
01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
and so I've just note it looks like the
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh analysis in our caption has a
 
01:58:00.430 --> 01:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
misprint uh at
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
80% yeah 85% is what we had back in 2013
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
I was you know at first I was thinking
 
01:58:10.270 --> 01:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
maybe we ought to put it at 90% or
 
01:58:14.149 --> 01:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
95% but uh I I know a lot of people are
 
01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
looking at that but that's very close to
 
01:58:21.069 --> 01:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
what the 17 up to the 51 and uh I think
 
01:58:24.189 --> 01:58:24.199 align:start position:0%
it's more realistic if we try to find
 
01:58:27.790 --> 01:58:27.800 align:start position:0%
that in between ground and that's why we
 
01:58:29.629 --> 01:58:29.639 align:start position:0%
had this discussion as I said back in
 
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
2013 and that's where it was decided
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
back then it may be different
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
now and
 
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
second in uh in lines 6 through n where
 
01:58:44.189 --> 01:58:44.199 align:start position:0%
the pration requirement is being deleted
 
01:58:48.189 --> 01:58:48.199 align:start position:0%
then uh in lines 29 to 31 where the 85%
 
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
floor is being inserted what happens
 
01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.830 align:start position:0%
floor is being inserted what happens
when

01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh when funds are short and it's above
 
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
85% isn't that VI pration yeah and and
 
01:59:04.350 --> 01:59:04.360 align:start position:0%
this is a a a discussion I had with
 
01:59:06.189 --> 01:59:06.199 align:start position:0%
legislative Services should we leave
 
01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
that in should we take it out I'm
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
leaving up to the committee right now to
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
look at this issue whether that area
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's struck up on the top there should
 
01:59:14.159 --> 01:59:14.910 align:start position:0%
that's struck up on the top there should
remain

01:59:14.910 --> 01:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
remain
 
01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
in well exactly what I was thinking so
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps the first one stays in and the
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
bottom one then limits it
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
that's exactly yeah okay representative
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
you very much representative llad for uh
 
01:59:32.430 --> 01:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
for for bringing this um this forward I
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have a lot to uh
 
01:59:36.350 --> 01:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
consider when it comes to cat to special
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
education Aid and to school funding uh
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
with all the bills that that uh with
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
different with different moving parts
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
and different solutions offered on this
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
one here though um would the special
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
education Aid uh still be subject to uh
 
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.709 align:start position:0%
education Aid uh still be subject to uh
budget

01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
appropriation there the intent of this
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
bill was to leave it to be appropriate
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
the same way we're doing it right now so
 
02:00:05.790 --> 02:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the budget yeah uh drawn
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
down from that appropriation and then
 
02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
should it fall below should it not meet
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
the 85% then subject to Joint fiscal
 
02:00:16.990 --> 02:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
request something like that that's the
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:24.149 --> 02:00:24.159 align:start position:0%

02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
hi good morning honorable chairperson
 
02:00:57.310 --> 02:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee thank you
 
02:00:59.069 --> 02:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
for taking the time to listen to My
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
Testimony my name is Caitlyn Bernier and
 
02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
I live in marac I am an elected school
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
budget committee um member and I have
 
02:01:13.390 --> 02:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
looked in much detail into our budget
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
into our special ed budget into our Aid
 
02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:19.639 align:start position:0%
into our grants all the different things
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
that we can look into and I have listed
 
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
listen to our taxpayers in our town and
 
02:01:26.669 --> 02:01:26.679 align:start position:0%
their concerns with the increase in our
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
budget and in their property taxes and
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
that it is more and more challenging
 
02:01:35.229 --> 02:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
with the increased costs of special
 
02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
education I've been deep diving into as
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
much as we possibly can into our budget
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
and these aren't things that we can uh
 
02:01:47.950 --> 02:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
take on at a district level for our
 
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers I'm only here to speak for
 
02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
myself though today
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
and not on the budget committee and I am
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
in um opposition of this budget uh this
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
change and the increase that it would
 
02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
cause our districts for special
 
02:02:10.669 --> 02:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
education if you were to break down that
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh 50 million or whatever that amount
 
02:02:17.229 --> 02:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
was to districts it would be about 9
 
02:02:19.229 --> 02:02:19.239 align:start position:0%
million more that each district would
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
have to take
 
02:02:23.470 --> 02:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
on we can even take on the increases
 
02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
that we have now how are we going to
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
take on more because the state isn't
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
holding up their end of the
 
02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
bargain we are educating everybody
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
because that's what public Ed is you
 
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
educate everybody and then we're
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to get reimbursed a certain
 
02:02:45.550 --> 02:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
percentage and then if the child's
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
education is over a certain percent
 
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to get 100% coverage of
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
that and that's not happening and it's
 
02:02:54.910 --> 02:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
really hard for taxpayers to understand
 
02:02:57.790 --> 02:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
that and that this isn't something that
 
02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
should be a problem with educating all
 
02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
students and it's starting to become one
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing people talking about well do
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
we have to educate special ed do we have
 
02:03:14.069 --> 02:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
to get all of our children education do
 
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
they all deserve it and I'm here to tell
 
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
you yes they all deserve to be educated
 
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
everybody does
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
so it is your responsibility to make
 
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
sure that the state holds up their end
 
02:03:29.310 --> 02:03:29.320 align:start position:0%
of the bargain since we're doing our
 
02:03:31.870 --> 02:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
part and we continue to have an increase
 
02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:34.719 align:start position:0%
in our taxes even if our budget didn't
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
increase this year our taxpayers still
 
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
have an increase to their bu their
 
02:03:44.069 --> 02:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
property taxes regardless of our budget
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
so now you want to add another 9 million
 
02:03:49.229 --> 02:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
in the future onto the things that we
 
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
already can't take
 
02:03:53.709 --> 02:03:53.719 align:start position:0%
that you're not being aware of what's
 
02:03:55.229 --> 02:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
going on in your communities if you're
 
02:03:55.239 --> 02:03:57.030 align:start position:0%
going on in your communities if you're
doing

02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:03:59.229 --> 02:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
that um I think that's all I have
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
somebody ask
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
question thank you yes representative
 
02:04:06.510 --> 02:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
papich Muller thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and testifying
 
02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
and taking
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
questions you are referring to
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
reductions in the support from the state
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
the way I read the bill it seems to
 
02:04:20.589 --> 02:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
increase the amount we would be sending
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
are we you know are we on agreement on
 
02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
this do do you want you know for example
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
this year we would only be able to pay
 
02:04:31.069 --> 02:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
about 2/3 of the amounts that are owed
 
02:04:33.149 --> 02:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
under a previous version of the bill
 
02:04:35.470 --> 02:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
this would make it mandatory that we pay
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
at least 85% so I'm just want to make
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
sure that you know we are talking based
 
02:04:43.390 --> 02:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
on the same understanding of the bill
 
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
yeah the way I read it is that if you
 
02:04:48.910 --> 02:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
don't uh have enough of that money in
 
02:04:52.350 --> 02:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
your your budget that we just don't get
 
02:04:55.549 --> 02:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
that amount back and we're just stuck
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
with the little bit and that's just you
 
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
get what you get and you don't get upset
 
02:05:04.109 --> 02:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
but we're upset thank
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
you for the record representative
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
Lun thank thanks very much um uh for for
 
02:05:14.669 --> 02:05:14.679 align:start position:0%
um for joining us this morning M Miss
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
berer um what I'm what I'm what I think
 
02:05:20.350 --> 02:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing you say is that is that you
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
would like to see a bill like this
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
strengthened to guarantee the Grant and
 
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
not not just set a pration floor yes yes
 
02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
I like a guarantee so that we know we
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
are educating everybody because that is
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
what you do in public Ed and that we are
 
02:05:40.149 --> 02:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
receiving that reimbursement and that we
 
02:05:41.229 --> 02:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
know we're going to get it we don't get
 
02:05:43.229 --> 02:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
it till the next year but knowing that
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
it is a guarantee and the districts can
 
02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
depend on that yes thank you thank you
 
02:05:52.030 --> 02:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank thank you Mr
 
02:05:56.030 --> 02:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here um so
 
02:05:59.629 --> 02:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
just to be clear we all would agree that
 
02:06:02.549 --> 02:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
85% is more than this year
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
67% and is profoundly less than
 
02:06:09.790 --> 02:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
100% could you speak to the impact of
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
districts not
 
02:06:15.069 --> 02:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
knowing what amount under the current
 
02:06:17.229 --> 02:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
Pro rating system they're going to get
 
02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
and and how that plays
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
out yeah so um in uh in the budget it
 
02:06:28.069 --> 02:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
would play out as you have to uh kind of
 
02:06:29.950 --> 02:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
guesstimate how much you're going to
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
have to put into the budget for special
 
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
ed and take into consideration that you
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
might have some students that come into
 
02:06:39.709 --> 02:06:39.719 align:start position:0%
your District that need out of District
 
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
that need some sort of extra so you have
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
to kind of give yourself that cushion
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
and the perception can be at times that
 
02:06:51.229 --> 02:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
if you give yourself that cushion and
 
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
then end up at the end of the year with
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
a surplus it's as if you are holding on
 
02:07:00.669 --> 02:07:00.679 align:start position:0%
to money for yourself when in reality
 
02:07:03.790 --> 02:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
you are anticipating needing money and
 
02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
then you know just like with any budget
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
I would hope that I if I can get under
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
my grocery budget then great job but you
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
know we don't want to go over it we need
 
02:07:16.990 --> 02:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
to stay under it and you know they we
 
02:07:19.069 --> 02:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
try to have under it but the perception
 
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
isn't always that we are um um funding
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
the education that the students need the
 
02:07:29.549 --> 02:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
right way because people don't always
 
02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
know what the cost is for special ed it
 
02:07:35.310 --> 02:07:35.320 align:start position:0%
it varies and the fact that it varies
 
02:07:37.149 --> 02:07:37.159 align:start position:0%
based off of what you get you pay
 
02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
educationally from your school district
 
02:07:40.510 --> 02:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
you don't pay like the medical and all
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
that stuff that's all kind of hard for
 
02:07:46.589 --> 02:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
understand yes representative thank you
 
02:07:51.229 --> 02:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
very much and again one last quick
 
02:07:51.239 --> 02:07:52.990 align:start position:0%
very much and again one last quick
question

02:07:52.990 --> 02:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
question would in your opinion this bill
 
02:07:57.870 --> 02:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
is written be an improvement both in
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
terms of the amount of money that would
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
come into the district and in terms of
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
reducing that uncertainty you just spoke
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
about I understand that you may want it
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
written differently but as written right
 
02:08:09.549 --> 02:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
to what you're formulating an opinion
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
would it make things better or worse by
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
itself um I think that it I would have
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
to read it again but um I think that it
 
02:08:21.950 --> 02:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
would potentially be
 
02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
in the uh short term but I I think that
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
um we need to increase just in do the um
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
amount that we're supposed to fulfill
 
02:08:37.549 --> 02:08:37.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so just to followup
 
02:08:41.229 --> 02:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
on that I'm I'm interpreting your your
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
concerns and I want to see if I have
 
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
this right clearly this is an effort to
 
02:08:51.149 --> 02:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
mitigate a problem that's manifested
 
02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
this here at 67% with the
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
shortfall is it your concern that this
 
02:08:58.950 --> 02:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
bill if it was passed with somehow
 
02:09:03.709 --> 02:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
signal consent to make 85% a routine as
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
if yeah like it's an acceptable we're
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
just going to not meet what we were
 
02:09:10.109 --> 02:09:10.119 align:start position:0%
saying we were going to and we're just
 
02:09:15.229 --> 02:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
going to stop at that percent instead of
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
the so 100% is the ideal and your your
 
02:09:21.629 --> 02:09:21.639 align:start position:0%
concern is whether expectations uh even
 
02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
amongst the administrators shift yes
 
02:09:27.310 --> 02:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
okay any further
 
02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
questions repres
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
I question on the language if we're
 
02:09:33.149 --> 02:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
calling it an
 
02:09:35.189 --> 02:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
entitlement why are we saying we're only
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
going to give you 80% of what you're
 
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
entitled to can can the language does it
 
02:09:40.669 --> 02:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
have to be written that way because an
 
02:09:44.229 --> 02:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
entitlement seems to see that that's a
 
02:09:47.069 --> 02:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
very good question for our work
 
02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
sessions okay yes I
 
02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
agree very good seeing no more questions
 
02:09:58.109 --> 02:09:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
you okay I have no other pink cards is
 
02:10:06.270 --> 02:10:06.280 align:start position:0%

representing tuon burough wolfboro and
 
03:24:26.429 --> 03:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
Al in the beautiful Lakes Region um the
 
03:24:30.670 --> 03:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
former education committee um heard uh
 
03:24:33.469 --> 03:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
several bills um over the past few years
 
03:24:37.950 --> 03:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
about uh gifted students um I think the
 
03:24:42.150 --> 03:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
furthest we were able to uh move on that
 
03:24:45.269 --> 03:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
was um with a collection of information
 
03:24:47.349 --> 03:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh from school districts about programs
 
03:24:49.189 --> 03:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
that they had
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
available um but I think I think we
 
03:24:57.790 --> 03:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
heard that many schools if not most um
 
03:25:01.550 --> 03:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
did not have uh programs in place for um
 
03:25:05.469 --> 03:25:05.479 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented uh children and uh I
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
think that um we need to have something
 
03:25:13.469 --> 03:25:13.479 align:start position:0%
available um for them um you know we uh
 
03:25:16.469 --> 03:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about um the students who
 
03:25:20.550 --> 03:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
are not performing and assisting them um
 
03:25:22.670 --> 03:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
but uh I think we also need to pay
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
attention to um those who um are uh
 
03:25:28.990 --> 03:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented in one way or
 
03:25:32.189 --> 03:25:32.199 align:start position:0%
another so that is the um purpose of
 
03:25:36.070 --> 03:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
this uh bill for enrichment
 
03:25:40.870 --> 03:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
scholarships and um on the first page uh
 
03:25:45.150 --> 03:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
you will see um uh the uh definition of
 
03:25:49.269 --> 03:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
quote unquote gifted students in Roman s
 
03:25:54.830 --> 03:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh this uh came from uh a number
 
03:25:57.830 --> 03:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
of sources um that I referenced um
 
03:26:00.030 --> 03:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
including an associate an association
 
03:26:03.790 --> 03:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
for gifted and talented students and um
 
03:26:06.389 --> 03:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
several others um I believe there is
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
actually one State uh I think it's Ohio
 
03:26:12.750 --> 03:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
that has a um uh gifted student uh
 
03:26:12.760 --> 03:26:14.189 align:start position:0%
that has a um uh gifted student uh
scholarship

03:26:14.189 --> 03:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
03:26:16.309 --> 03:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
program um but that's the only one that
 
03:26:20.830 --> 03:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
I know of uh so um in that definition
 
03:26:25.189 --> 03:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
you can see that U it's uh it covers uh
 
03:26:29.790 --> 03:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
gifted students um for a number of areas
 
03:26:33.349 --> 03:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
of giftedness which is defined but also
 
03:26:36.349 --> 03:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
students that are categorized as uh
 
03:26:39.110 --> 03:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
twice exceptional or maybe in the past
 
03:26:42.870 --> 03:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
were twice gifted um uh
 
03:26:45.630 --> 03:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
categorized um who have a disability but
 
03:26:49.349 --> 03:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
also um a talent
 
03:26:55.309 --> 03:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh so the idea is of this program is to
 
03:26:58.910 --> 03:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh present an opportunity for families
 
03:27:02.269 --> 03:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
of those children to apply for
 
03:27:05.229 --> 03:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
scholarship uh the scholarship would be
 
03:27:07.349 --> 03:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
run by the Department of
 
03:27:11.070 --> 03:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
Education uh it would be an award of up
 
03:27:11.080 --> 03:27:12.189 align:start position:0%
Education uh it would be an award of up
to

03:27:12.189 --> 03:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:27:17.550 --> 03:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
$1,000 uh annually uh for a student
 
03:27:21.990 --> 03:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
and uh on page two I list um the uh
 
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
expenses for which uh the scholarship uh
 
03:27:27.229 --> 03:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
could be used
 
03:27:31.309 --> 03:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
um tuition tutoring uh instructional
 
03:27:36.070 --> 03:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
materials um Etc on page two in Roman 3
 
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
um as you'll see on lines 10 on
 
03:27:44.790 --> 03:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
down um and I even included on line 26
 
03:27:47.550 --> 03:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
um therapies and so forth for those um
 
03:27:50.630 --> 03:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
students who might be twice
 
03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
exceptional uh there would be an
 
03:27:55.950 --> 03:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
application process that goes on to page
 
03:27:57.990 --> 03:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
three of the
 
03:28:02.189 --> 03:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
bill um and uh the department would
 
03:28:06.229 --> 03:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
actually establish a review panel uh to
 
03:28:10.590 --> 03:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
review the uh applications for uh a
 
03:28:14.550 --> 03:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship and um one person of the
 
03:28:16.710 --> 03:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
panel uh would be some someone who is
 
03:28:20.590 --> 03:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
trained in um the identification of
 
03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:22.750 align:start position:0%
trained in um the identification of
gifted

03:28:22.750 --> 03:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
gifted
 
03:28:24.870 --> 03:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
students um they would make a
 
03:28:27.670 --> 03:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
determination on the ability
 
03:28:31.870 --> 03:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility and uh the um the giftedness
 
03:28:36.229 --> 03:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
and the amount of a scholarship um if so
 
03:28:39.990 --> 03:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
determined u based on the uh application
 
03:28:44.510 --> 03:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
and the uh expenses um and requirements
 
03:28:47.950 --> 03:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
that the parents wanted to use the money
 
03:28:50.790 --> 03:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
for U from the
 
03:28:55.229 --> 03:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
scholarship um on the bottom of uh that
 
03:28:58.070 --> 03:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
page um go into the responsibilities of
 
03:28:58.080 --> 03:28:58.830 align:start position:0%
page um go into the responsibilities of
the

03:28:58.830 --> 03:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:29:03.269 --> 03:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
department um and uh I will note that uh
 
03:29:05.990 --> 03:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
on the top of page four they can use an
 
03:29:09.229 --> 03:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
electronic system um to uh track
 
03:29:12.189 --> 03:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
expenses and so forth and uh I do know
 
03:29:14.910 --> 03:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
that the department um has in the past
 
03:29:16.590 --> 03:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
used the uh
 
03:29:20.750 --> 03:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
same um system that is used by the
 
03:29:22.670 --> 03:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund for track
 
03:29:24.790 --> 03:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
and expenses in the EFA program the
 
03:29:27.990 --> 03:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
department has used that system um for
 
03:29:32.469 --> 03:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
um uh summer uh scholarships
 
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
programs um so that will help them keep
 
03:29:38.590 --> 03:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
track of things um and monitor the
 
03:29:43.510 --> 03:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
expenses uh um being uh requested by uh
 
03:29:47.229 --> 03:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
the parents of the scholarship winners
 
03:29:49.950 --> 03:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh the bill talks about
 
03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
education uh scholarship service
 
03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
providers um and their compliance with
 
03:30:01.469 --> 03:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
law um one important thing is um the
 
03:30:06.590 --> 03:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
rues um I specify what rules are to be
 
03:30:08.469 --> 03:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh put in place by the department and
 
03:30:12.710 --> 03:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's not uh um a wide open U Ru making
 
03:30:16.630 --> 03:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
Authority for them uh but specific for
 
03:30:21.790 --> 03:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
this um uh this committee um there is uh
 
03:30:21.800 --> 03:30:23.389 align:start position:0%
this um uh this committee um there is uh

scholarship um which I've requested an
 
03:30:33.590 --> 03:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation of a million dollar a year
 
03:30:36.790 --> 03:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
which would uh fund um possibly a

thousand students um each
 
03:30:43.550 --> 03:30:43.560 align:start position:0%

in the fiscal note they don't put any
 
03:31:56.469 --> 03:31:56.479 align:start position:0%

03:32:11.670 --> 03:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
um um I'm trying to remember my
 
03:32:13.550 --> 03:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
discussion with the Department if that
 
03:32:17.309 --> 03:32:17.319 align:start position:0%
was um a position to get started or if
 
03:32:21.309 --> 03:32:21.319 align:start position:0%
um uh or if it was my mistake in leaving
 
03:32:23.830 --> 03:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh out the second year of the
 
03:32:27.349 --> 03:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
budget um but um I I would think that
 
03:32:29.790 --> 03:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
probably um a second year for that
 
03:32:31.229 --> 03:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
position would be
 
03:32:34.990 --> 03:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
required follow yes how much effort do
 
03:32:37.189 --> 03:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
you think it will take for the committee
 
03:32:40.590 --> 03:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
to process one application will they be
 
03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
interviewing the student is that an hour
 
03:32:45.030 --> 03:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
is that a how do you how do you envision
 
03:32:48.030 --> 03:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
that don't necessarily en Envision them
 
03:32:50.510 --> 03:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh interviewing um the student or the
 
03:32:52.990 --> 03:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
family but uh really just reviewing the
 
03:32:55.030 --> 03:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
panel and uh any school records that
 
03:32:57.910 --> 03:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
were uh necessary to uh look at in terms
 
03:33:00.830 --> 03:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
of uh their achievement
 
03:33:04.070 --> 03:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
levels further questions
 
03:33:06.550 --> 03:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:33:09.110 --> 03:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
03:33:10.990 --> 03:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
can you just talk a little bit more
 
03:33:13.229 --> 03:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
about the definition of giftedness
 
03:33:16.110 --> 03:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
because I
 
03:33:20.229 --> 03:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
as I read this on page one um lines 25
 
03:33:20.239 --> 03:33:21.030 align:start position:0%
as I read this on page one um lines 25
through

03:33:21.030 --> 03:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:33:24.110 --> 03:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
29 um you know general or specific
 
03:33:26.269 --> 03:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
intellectual ability specific academic
 
03:33:28.590 --> 03:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
aptitude creative or productive thinking
 
03:33:30.309 --> 03:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
Etc and it says you know right above
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
that gifted students are capable of high
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
performance exceptional production or
 
03:33:37.830 --> 03:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
exceptional learning Behavior now as the
 
03:33:40.229 --> 03:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
mother of two children I can tell you
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
that I feel that they fit into that
 
03:33:44.870 --> 03:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
category by my standards so I'm not
 
03:33:46.349 --> 03:33:46.359 align:start position:0%
really sure what
 
03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
the standards are then again on
 
03:33:49.279 --> 03:33:51.429 align:start position:0%
the standards are then again on
page

03:33:51.429 --> 03:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:33:54.830 --> 03:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
three it talks a little bit um this
 
03:33:58.590 --> 03:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
lines 12 through 17 or 18 it talks a
 
03:34:01.030 --> 03:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
little bit about eligibility but it
 
03:34:04.590 --> 03:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:10.349 --> 03:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
me well um I I think that uh uh
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
giftedness um as as you point out is
 
03:34:15.030 --> 03:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes in the eye of the beholder
 
03:34:17.189 --> 03:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
especially when we're talking about
 
03:34:19.830 --> 03:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
parents but
 
03:34:23.349 --> 03:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
um I tried to leave it a little bit
 
03:34:25.830 --> 03:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
General um it it's hard to Define
 
03:34:28.030 --> 03:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
especially when you're talking about uh
 
03:34:31.189 --> 03:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
different categories um it's not just uh
 
03:34:35.070 --> 03:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
academ academic um achievement uh but
 
03:34:38.510 --> 03:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
also it could be uh Arts um it could be
 
03:34:42.950 --> 03:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
music um are uh areas where uh someone
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
could qualify um for a scholarship under
 
03:34:51.389 --> 03:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
this program I believe um and um again
 
03:34:54.910 --> 03:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh I I tried to uh research as much as I
 
03:34:58.830 --> 03:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
could um about uh definitions and what
 
03:35:02.790 --> 03:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
criteria might be used um and uh this is
 
03:35:06.590 --> 03:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:06.600 --> 03:35:08.229 align:start position:0%
 
with

03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:35:13.469 --> 03:35:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:17.710 --> 03:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
be there there's no um I'm not going to
 
03:35:20.070 --> 03:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at for instance um I've
 
03:35:22.990 --> 03:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
looked at um the gift twice excuse me
 
03:35:27.150 --> 03:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
twice exceptional category and um I've
 
03:35:30.189 --> 03:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
seen one definition that says um a
 
03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
disability plus an IQ of 130 or above um
 
03:35:38.150 --> 03:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to um get into anything
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
like that um I wanted to have more
 
03:35:46.189 --> 03:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
flexibility because um uh I IQ
 
03:35:49.110 --> 03:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think is a a total measure of
 
03:35:52.670 --> 03:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
what we want to um uh provide students
 
03:35:57.309 --> 03:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
with a scholarship for um it's as I said
 
03:36:01.710 --> 03:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
uh on line six excuse me 19 um abilities
 
03:36:05.870 --> 03:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
talent and po potential for
 
03:36:07.630 --> 03:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
accomplishment further questions
 
03:36:10.189 --> 03:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
representative luno thanks very much Mr
 
03:36:11.269 --> 03:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much
 
03:36:15.710 --> 03:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
representative um uh so the uh the ear
 
03:36:18.349 --> 03:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
earlier it may have been late last week
 
03:36:21.710 --> 03:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
the um the N tests uh test results came
 
03:36:23.950 --> 03:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
out for all the schools in New Hampshire
 
03:36:26.309 --> 03:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
yes and um both fourth grade and eighth
 
03:36:28.510 --> 03:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
grade uh math and reading and I'm just
 
03:36:30.790 --> 03:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
wondering in your opinion in your
 
03:36:35.830 --> 03:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
opinion um do you believe that um that
 
03:36:38.990 --> 03:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
there might be more gifted students or
 
03:36:43.229 --> 03:36:43.239 align:start position:0%
in your opinion gifted students um um
 
03:36:46.750 --> 03:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
from the um the the school performing at
 
03:36:52.510 --> 03:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
the top of the nape test than at the
 
03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
bottom um that's possible I I would hat
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
I would hate to put a definitive answer
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
to that um because you do say Statewide
 
03:37:06.229 --> 03:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
assessment tests being being they right
 
03:37:08.830 --> 03:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
but there there are children who do well
 
03:37:11.229 --> 03:37:11.239 align:start position:0%
on the Statewide assessment um in in
 
03:37:13.510 --> 03:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
every school district right I'm just
 
03:37:15.790 --> 03:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
saying more more do you think there's
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
more at the top than at the bottom
 
03:37:19.269 --> 03:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
that's possible
 
03:37:21.550 --> 03:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
 
03:37:24.830 --> 03:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
committee yes thank you Mr chairman
 
03:37:28.229 --> 03:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this forth um is
 
03:37:29.910 --> 03:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
there an assessment I have two questions
 
03:37:31.870 --> 03:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
is there an assessment for giftedness
 
03:37:33.750 --> 03:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
and the second thing is suppose that you
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
have a thousand uh recipients of the
 
03:37:37.510 --> 03:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship the first year are they
 
03:37:39.189 --> 03:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
grandfathered into the second year do
 
03:37:40.870 --> 03:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
they need to reapply or is there more
 
03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
going to be available to more gifted the
 
03:37:45.990 --> 03:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
next year um
 
03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh the first first part of your question
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
was uh a test is there an assessment
 
03:37:52.950 --> 03:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
that would say that these are gifted and
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
these no no um and um I don't see this
 
03:38:02.349 --> 03:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
as uh necessarily um a student
 
03:38:04.910 --> 03:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
qualifying for every year in high school
 
03:38:08.070 --> 03:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
or every year from seventh grade on um
 
03:38:12.150 --> 03:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
this could be uh uh a targeted uh length
 
03:38:14.590 --> 03:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
of time so there would be an annual
 
03:38:14.600 --> 03:38:17.670 align:start position:0%
of time so there would be an annual
application

03:38:17.670 --> 03:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
and that would also give more students
 
03:38:26.950 --> 03:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:29.229 --> 03:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
scholarship I got one question you've
 
03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
probably heard me say it many times
 
03:38:35.309 --> 03:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
represent cour heli um uh the one of the
 
03:38:38.469 --> 03:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
better programs we know is down at Yukon
 
03:38:43.309 --> 03:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
uh in gifted and talented um the issue
 
03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
we have here is that we have gone that
 
03:38:49.750 --> 03:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
route many many times before and we
 
03:38:52.110 --> 03:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
found the expense but we've also had it
 
03:38:54.790 --> 03:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
countered by those that including the
 
03:38:56.830 --> 03:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
previous commissioner not the one we
 
03:38:59.469 --> 03:38:59.479 align:start position:0%
have right now said we have giftedness
 
03:39:01.750 --> 03:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
we have giftedness in the form of AP
 
03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
courses at the high school we have
 
03:39:05.950 --> 03:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
giftedness in terms of some of the
 
03:39:08.309 --> 03:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
selected programming which can occur at
 
03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
schools and if we're going to truly get
 
03:39:13.950 --> 03:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
into a gifted program we need to have
 
03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
specific criteria conditions which I I
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
see some here but you know in in general
 
03:39:21.510 --> 03:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
specific intellectual ability that's
 
03:39:23.429 --> 03:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
usually done off a Wexler and you're
 
03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
correct you know if you're talking about
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
standard deviation and all that usually
 
03:39:29.830 --> 03:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
around 130 or higher may go down even
 
03:39:32.550 --> 03:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
128 uh and then the academic aptitude
 
03:39:34.389 --> 03:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of achievement testing
 
03:39:37.429 --> 03:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
that's usually scoring 95% or higher on
 
03:39:39.670 --> 03:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
two nationally normed achievement test
 
03:39:42.429 --> 03:39:42.439 align:start position:0%
so in two categories within that test uh
 
03:39:44.229 --> 03:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
creative thinking yes being creative and
 
03:39:46.830 --> 03:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
Leadership skills within the school um
 
03:39:48.670 --> 03:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the teacher
 
03:39:52.670 --> 03:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the parent um so I'm
 
03:39:54.830 --> 03:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
looking that number e to here where you
 
03:39:57.630 --> 03:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
have on the first page Visual Arts
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
Performing Arts Musical and psycho motor
 
03:39:59.760 --> 03:40:00.750 align:start position:0%
Performing Arts Musical and psycho motor
act

03:40:00.750 --> 03:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
act
 
03:40:03.070 --> 03:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
abilities are we now getting into the
 
03:40:05.710 --> 03:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
area that of talented this where we
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
could have a program available for an
 
03:40:12.950 --> 03:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
extremely talented golfer or a
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
basketball player uh
 
03:40:19.349 --> 03:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
um that's that's where the question is
 
03:40:20.910 --> 03:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
trying to break it apart between gifted
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
and talented right um yeah I I would not
 
03:40:27.670 --> 03:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
see this uh extending into uh into
 
03:40:30.790 --> 03:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
Athletics um but certainly um you know I
 
03:40:36.870 --> 03:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
would want uh the Arts included in it um
 
03:40:40.950 --> 03:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
including including music um if that
 
03:40:43.349 --> 03:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
includes dance that's that's fine with
 
03:40:47.189 --> 03:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
me um but um you know that's as far as
 
03:40:50.590 --> 03:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
I'd be going on that score thank
 
03:40:53.710 --> 03:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
03:40:56.670 --> 03:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:59.550 --> 03:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
E I see I see that you've got a
 
03:41:01.309 --> 03:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
definition of scholarship service
 
03:41:04.590 --> 03:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
provider here on the first page and then
 
03:41:07.550 --> 03:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh sprinkled throughout our various
 
03:41:10.269 --> 03:41:10.279 align:start position:0%
activities that are assigned functions
 
03:41:12.070 --> 03:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
that are assigned to the scholarship
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
service provider or providers and
 
03:41:20.150 --> 03:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
my question to you is whether those
 
03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
activities the
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
awards um the papers produced by a
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
scholarship service program functioning
 
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
under this bill would be fully reachable
 
03:41:39.309 --> 03:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
in an audit uh conducted by the state of
 
03:41:43.189 --> 03:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh of the program in some's future
 
03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:52.030 --> 03:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
information um are you thinking that the
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh service providers themselves should
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
be audited is
 
03:41:59.389 --> 03:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
that is that where you were going with
 
03:41:59.399 --> 03:42:00.910 align:start position:0%
that is that where you were going with
the

03:42:00.910 --> 03:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:04.750 --> 03:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
question could you P sry that's right
 
03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the advice um I often do that
 
03:42:11.070 --> 03:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
um we all do I was thinking of the
 
03:42:13.750 --> 03:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
program which in part in involves
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship service provider
 
03:42:19.469 --> 03:42:19.479 align:start position:0%
and if and let's and I'm assuming that
 
03:42:22.790 --> 03:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
an audit a performance audit would be
 
03:42:25.630 --> 03:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
undertaken of the program including the
 
03:42:29.950 --> 03:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship service providers and that
 
03:42:33.189 --> 03:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh documents and information and uh
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
people uh would need to be accessed that
 
03:42:37.670 --> 03:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
are under the umbrella of the
 
03:42:40.590 --> 03:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
scholarship service provider and the
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
question is whether uh that information
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
would be fully accessible in that
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
audit um I'm not sure about fully
 
03:42:54.070 --> 03:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
accessible a lot of that is uh private
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
information from the service provider
 
03:42:58.550 --> 03:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
but the program uh should be uh uh
 
03:43:03.630 --> 03:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:07.710 --> 03:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:10.830 --> 03:43:10.840 align:start position:0%

um

03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:31.469 --> 03:43:31.479 align:start position:0%
it I've
 
03:43:36.309 --> 03:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:40.030 --> 03:43:40.040 align:start position:0%

thank you um under tuition for
 
03:43:52.469 --> 03:43:52.479 align:start position:0%
individual classes Public School Charter
 
03:43:54.750 --> 03:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
Public Academy could the the tuition
 
03:43:58.750 --> 03:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
also be used at a community college for
 
03:44:01.349 --> 03:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
example I I think that that's uh
 
03:44:05.630 --> 03:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
probably a good addition to that list
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
yes I I have a question until represent
 
03:44:11.429 --> 03:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
Damon comes up with hers um under those
 
03:44:13.710 --> 03:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
areas which the the program be possibly
 
03:44:15.590 --> 03:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
used for on page two
 
03:44:17.630 --> 03:44:17.640 align:start position:0%

03:44:52.189 --> 03:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
um it uh I I think was left up to the
 
03:44:54.070 --> 03:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
parent if they thought that they needed
 
03:44:56.189 --> 03:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
additional uh therapies this would be
 
03:44:59.149 --> 03:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
for for instance a a twice exceptional
 
03:44:59.159 --> 03:45:00.750 align:start position:0%
for for instance a a twice exceptional
student

03:45:00.750 --> 03:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
student
 
03:45:04.429 --> 03:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
um if the uh IP for instance called for
 
03:45:06.469 --> 03:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
X number of hours but the parent wanted
 
03:45:11.070 --> 03:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
to do uh more because of the uh uh needs
 
03:45:14.030 --> 03:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
related to the talent of the student um
 
03:45:18.070 --> 03:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
or the giftedness of the student um they
 
03:45:22.469 --> 03:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
could um provide some um via the
 
03:45:25.750 --> 03:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship okay repres Damon are you
 
03:45:25.760 --> 03:45:26.750 align:start position:0%

yet yes thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:45:31.550 --> 03:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
your patience there's a lot of pages
 
03:45:33.950 --> 03:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
here uh in any case and thank you for
 
03:45:36.870 --> 03:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question on page five line 16
 
03:45:36.880 --> 03:45:38.550 align:start position:0%
taking my question on page five line 16
and

03:45:38.550 --> 03:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
17 um I'm concerned about that allowing
 
03:45:45.830 --> 03:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
a quote unquote scholarship service
 
03:45:49.389 --> 03:45:49.399 align:start position:0%
provider to limit access to Services by
 
03:45:52.389 --> 03:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
a student and discriminate for a variety
 
03:45:54.590 --> 03:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
of different reasons like to limit their
 
03:45:56.590 --> 03:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
services to people of one particular
 
03:46:01.710 --> 03:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:01.720 --> 03:46:05.550 align:start position:0%
 
intent

03:46:05.550 --> 03:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:09.870 --> 03:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
um the uh intent there is that um we
 
03:46:12.590 --> 03:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
want to provide the independence of the
 
03:46:15.469 --> 03:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
service provider um
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh religious freedom for instance is um
 
03:46:20.990 --> 03:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know the main thing in in my mind um
 
03:46:24.550 --> 03:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
I don't uh anticipate that uh anything
 
03:46:26.429 --> 03:46:26.439 align:start position:0%
along those lines would come into play
 
03:46:30.149 --> 03:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
with this kind of scholarship uh program
 
03:46:33.149 --> 03:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
but um wanted to have that Independence
 
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
um in the
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
statute P up yes thank
 
03:46:41.990 --> 03:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
you would you entertain an amendment
 
03:46:44.590 --> 03:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
that indicates that scholarship service
 
03:46:47.349 --> 03:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
Prov ERS cannot discriminate against
 
03:46:50.830 --> 03:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
students um I I think that that is um a
 
03:46:54.349 --> 03:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
little bit broad for my um perspective
 
03:46:58.110 --> 03:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
but um it's the committee's bill
 
03:47:03.149 --> 03:47:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:08.110 --> 03:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
Ames on page uh what is this page
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
five lines 14 to 15 there's a statement
 
03:47:13.189 --> 03:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
that any scholarship service provider
 
03:47:15.070 --> 03:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
that accepts payment from the program
 
03:47:17.269 --> 03:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
under this chapter is not an agent of
 
03:47:20.510 --> 03:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
the state or federal government why is
 
03:47:22.469 --> 03:47:22.479 align:start position:0%
that statement in
 
03:47:25.830 --> 03:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
there um just to clarify that this is an
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
independent uh person um they are not
 
03:47:30.550 --> 03:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
working on behalf of the state or the
 
03:47:33.630 --> 03:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
federal government um this is um
 
03:47:37.189 --> 03:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
language that's F found in many
 
03:47:41.910 --> 03:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
um uh such programs and such uh uh
 
03:47:45.830 --> 03:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
education scholarship um and education
 
03:47:49.710 --> 03:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:51.790 --> 03:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
programs yes
 
03:47:53.990 --> 03:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
representes but aren't the activities
 
03:47:55.990 --> 03:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
and functions assigned to this provider
 
03:47:59.830 --> 03:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
or these providers exactly what an agent
 
03:48:02.550 --> 03:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
of the state would be doing that it
 
03:48:05.349 --> 03:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
almost by necessity the description of
 
03:48:07.950 --> 03:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
their functions and Duties are the
 
03:48:11.590 --> 03:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
descriptions of what what is would be
 
03:48:15.389 --> 03:48:15.399 align:start position:0%
done by an agent of the State uh but
 
03:48:18.830 --> 03:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
they are they are working um for the
 
03:48:21.349 --> 03:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
family at this point they are not
 
03:48:23.710 --> 03:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
working for the state they're working
 
03:48:25.830 --> 03:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
for the family and being paid by this
 
03:48:29.189 --> 03:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:32.309 --> 03:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
scholarship thank you
 
03:48:35.710 --> 03:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
Luna thank you very much Mr chair so um
 
03:48:37.990 --> 03:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
is any of the determination of an
 
03:48:41.590 --> 03:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
eligible student um connected with um
 
03:48:45.469 --> 03:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
with the students Financial need no so
 
03:48:48.630 --> 03:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's followup yes so so you're calling
 
03:48:51.149 --> 03:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
it a scholarship but it's not it's not
 
03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
connected with financial need so do you
 
03:48:58.189 --> 03:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
think it's fair for taxpayers across the
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
state to fund these scholarships for you
 
03:49:06.990 --> 03:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
know students that live in very affluent
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know come from affluent backgrounds
 
03:49:13.870 --> 03:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
um I I think that uh we want to provide
 
03:49:17.550 --> 03:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
for um the least of these as well as the
 
03:49:23.189 --> 03:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
best and the brightest and um uh the
 
03:49:25.389 --> 03:49:25.399 align:start position:0%
public education is to educate the
 
03:49:30.070 --> 03:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
public and um we want to
 
03:49:34.229 --> 03:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
um provide for these students um
 
03:49:38.750 --> 03:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of their family background or
 
03:49:41.670 --> 03:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
the area that they live um and we want
 
03:49:46.349 --> 03:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
to help um those with exceptional needs
 
03:49:51.630 --> 03:49:51.640 align:start position:0%
um provide for us in the future um to
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
have them succeed and if uh a
 
03:49:58.110 --> 03:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
scholarship or a summer uh program will
 
03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
help them do that then I think it's uh
 
03:50:02.830 --> 03:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
in the state's best
 
03:50:04.590 --> 03:50:04.600 align:start position:0%

03:51:24.870 --> 03:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
mean I as a parent can just have the
 
03:51:27.469 --> 03:51:27.479 align:start position:0%
scholarship pay for Wi-Fi at my
 
03:51:31.389 --> 03:51:31.399 align:start position:0%
house is that appropriate is that what's
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
intended let me rephrase that is that
 
03:51:36.110 --> 03:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
what's intended um if uh someone in the
 
03:51:40.110 --> 03:51:40.120 align:start position:0%
North country does not have um uh
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:50.630 --> 03:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
um but has a scholarship um then uh
 
03:51:52.790 --> 03:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
internet connectivity would be an
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
allowable expense in my opinion but um
 
03:51:58.670 --> 03:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
the department will write those rules um
 
03:52:01.110 --> 03:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
and I know they have in other cases uh
 
03:52:03.710 --> 03:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
said for instance you can only buy a new
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
computer every X number of years things
 
03:52:08.189 --> 03:52:08.199 align:start position:0%
like that in
 
03:52:11.149 --> 03:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
rules thank you further
 
03:52:13.670 --> 03:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing thank you very much
 
03:52:15.630 --> 03:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
have a good afternoon
 
03:52:24.670 --> 03:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:26.630 --> 03:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
Moffett thank you Mr chair I hadn't
 
03:52:28.349 --> 03:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
planned to say anything but I uh
 
03:52:29.309 --> 03:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
obviously some of you know I'm
 
03:52:30.910 --> 03:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
interested in this topic and I just
 
03:52:33.389 --> 03:52:33.399 align:start position:0%
quickly wanted to point out that a we've
 
03:52:35.630 --> 03:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
been down the short a little bit before
 
03:52:38.469 --> 03:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
a couple terms ago we did pass HB 321
 
03:52:40.830 --> 03:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
which simply required uh school
 
03:52:43.630 --> 03:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
districts to submit a report to the
 
03:52:45.189 --> 03:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Education on what if
 
03:52:48.349 --> 03:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
anything they do for gifted students uh
 
03:52:51.149 --> 03:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
as luck would have it uh I was uh doing
 
03:52:53.149 --> 03:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
some legislative tourism this morning
 
03:52:55.429 --> 03:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
going from room to room and I happened
 
03:52:58.349 --> 03:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
to come in here and I sat next to
 
03:52:59.830 --> 03:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative not representative
 
03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
attorney Diana Fenton from doe I just
 
03:53:06.670 --> 03:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
happen to uh float by her uh and remind
 
03:53:09.269 --> 03:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
her that we did do this measure uh a
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
couple years ago about gifted students
 
03:53:14.229 --> 03:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
and I I said some of us are interested
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
in what doe may have compiled uh since
 
03:53:20.030 --> 03:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
we passed uh HB 321 so anyway I just
 
03:53:23.070 --> 03:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
want to let you know that uh I I did
 
03:53:25.950 --> 03:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
mention gifted to doe and Diana this
 
03:53:29.469 --> 03:53:29.479 align:start position:0%
morning and the the other thing I just
 
03:53:32.429 --> 03:53:32.439 align:start position:0%
would like to say is that when we did
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
321 couple terms ago that was not the
 
03:53:36.510 --> 03:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
first time it came up we had brought it
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
up uh the term before it was sent to uh
 
03:53:39.199 --> 03:53:40.269 align:start position:0%
up uh the term before it was sent to uh
interim

03:53:40.269 --> 03:53:40.279 align:start position:0%
interim
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
study uh and one of the things we found
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
out in interim study is that new New
 
03:53:48.510 --> 03:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was arguably one of the worst
 
03:53:51.030 --> 03:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
maybe the worst based on the research
 
03:53:54.550 --> 03:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
that we got from interim study the maybe
 
03:53:56.229 --> 03:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
we like say New Hampshire is number one
 
03:54:00.309 --> 03:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
so often but in terms of gifted student
 
03:54:02.910 --> 03:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh taking care of that population we
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
arguably were the worst in the country
 
03:54:07.189 --> 03:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of identifying and and
 
03:54:09.469 --> 03:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
supporting uh gifted and talented
 
03:54:13.189 --> 03:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
students uh Mississippi uh we our
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
research showed Mississippi who we
 
03:54:17.110 --> 03:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
always like dump on uh in terms of what
 
03:54:18.830 --> 03:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
they do for Education was doing some
 
03:54:20.630 --> 03:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
really neat stuff for gift so anyway I
 
03:54:22.510 --> 03:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that whatever the
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
committee does or doesn't do with with
 
03:54:27.149 --> 03:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
this uh HB 747 I I just want to
 
03:54:31.030 --> 03:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
emphasize that uh New Hampshire uh could
 
03:54:33.990 --> 03:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
and should take a look at uh what we do
 
03:54:35.790 --> 03:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
or don't do or could do for for the
 
03:54:35.800 --> 03:54:37.349 align:start position:0%
or don't do or could do for for the
gifted

03:54:37.349 --> 03:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
gifted
 
03:54:39.630 --> 03:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
population thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:54:42.030 --> 03:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
very much representative any
 
03:54:45.189 --> 03:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing thank you very much
 
03:55:01.309 --> 03:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:04.870 --> 03:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
wiy oh sorry I should know this by
 
03:55:06.790 --> 03:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
now thank you for your help and thank
 
03:55:08.710 --> 03:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
you for listening to me um I'm Mary
 
03:55:11.830 --> 03:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
wilky I live in conquered um and um I'm
 
03:55:15.149 --> 03:55:15.159 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill I um I agree though
 
03:55:17.149 --> 03:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
with representative cordelli that we
 
03:55:18.990 --> 03:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
need to pay attention to gifted and
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
talented students I just don't see this
 
03:55:24.189 --> 03:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
as the best way to do it um f first of
 
03:55:26.429 --> 03:55:26.439 align:start position:0%
all I think that before we direct money
 
03:55:28.269 --> 03:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
uh to private providers outside the
 
03:55:30.630 --> 03:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
school system our first priority should
 
03:55:32.429 --> 03:55:32.439 align:start position:0%
be ensuring that every student in every
 
03:55:34.429 --> 03:55:34.439 align:start position:0%
Public School including every gifted
 
03:55:37.349 --> 03:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
child in public school has access to an
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
excellent education that meets their
 
03:55:41.269 --> 03:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
needs and uh that means fully funding
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for constitutionally
 
03:55:45.149 --> 03:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
03:55:47.269 --> 03:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
in many cases children discover their
 
03:55:49.950 --> 03:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
aptitudes while they're in school and
 
03:55:51.349 --> 03:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
for instance I know a young man who
 
03:55:54.870 --> 03:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
became a translator in his adult life um
 
03:55:57.110 --> 03:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
the reason he came to pursue that path
 
03:55:59.550 --> 03:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
is because he took language classes at
 
03:56:02.910 --> 03:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
conquered High School um yet many public
 
03:56:04.189 --> 03:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
school students in New Hampshire don't
 
03:56:06.309 --> 03:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
have access to language classes because
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
there their schools can't afford to
 
03:56:10.670 --> 03:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
offer them uh they won't know that they
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
have a gift their parents won't know
 
03:56:13.389 --> 03:56:13.399 align:start position:0%
they have a gift they haven't been
 
03:56:14.870 --> 03:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
exposed to it
 
03:56:17.229 --> 03:56:17.239 align:start position:0%
uh similarly students who attend schools
 
03:56:21.110 --> 03:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
that can't afford art or music um they
 
03:56:22.830 --> 03:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
can't discover unless they're doing it
 
03:56:24.389 --> 03:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
on their own unless their parents are
 
03:56:26.750 --> 03:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
providing opportunities separately and
 
03:56:29.070 --> 03:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
privately they won't know that they've
 
03:56:31.469 --> 03:56:31.479 align:start position:0%
got this talent and so shouldn't we make
 
03:56:33.510 --> 03:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
sure that every student in New Hampshire
 
03:56:35.670 --> 03:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
has all the opportunities that we say
 
03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
they should have um in arts instruction
 
03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
language instruction Etc so that uh they
 
03:56:44.229 --> 03:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
know that they can pursue their aptitude
 
03:56:46.710 --> 03:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
udes and their interests before we spend
 
03:56:49.349 --> 03:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
money on public money which is limited
 
03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
of course on after school or outside of
 
03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
school private opportunities um I'm a
 
03:56:57.429 --> 03:56:57.439 align:start position:0%
retired teacher and I do acknowledge
 
03:56:59.510 --> 03:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
that meeting the needs of gifted and
 
03:57:02.229 --> 03:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
talented students is challenging and I'm
 
03:57:04.030 --> 03:57:04.040 align:start position:0%
not talking about your straight A
 
03:57:05.550 --> 03:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
students we have them every year we
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
prepare for them we know we need to
 
03:57:09.349 --> 03:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
challenge them we work on challenging
 
03:57:11.269 --> 03:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
them we differentiate our instructions
 
03:57:12.910 --> 03:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
so that they're challenged but when you
 
03:57:16.469 --> 03:57:16.479 align:start position:0%
have a really trly sort of out of the
 
03:57:21.910 --> 03:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
norm child it's challenging and and I
 
03:57:23.670 --> 03:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
would always take that responsibility
 
03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
really seriously but I didn't feel that
 
03:57:28.710 --> 03:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
I always succeeded I tried hard and what
 
03:57:29.870 --> 03:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
would have really helped me because my
 
03:57:31.870 --> 03:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
school district did not have a gifted
 
03:57:33.790 --> 03:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
and talented program what would have
 
03:57:36.030 --> 03:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
helped me would be if there was somebody
 
03:57:37.950 --> 03:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
I could consult with and I'm thinking
 
03:57:40.990 --> 03:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
that this person that under the current
 
03:57:44.229 --> 03:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
bill would be at the doe reviewing
 
03:57:45.750 --> 03:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
scholarships and helping that
 
03:57:47.950 --> 03:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship program If instead it could
 
03:57:50.469 --> 03:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
be somebody who's uh an expert in gifted
 
03:57:52.590 --> 03:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
and talented and education collects
 
03:57:55.710 --> 03:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
resources and a teacher could contact
 
03:57:57.950 --> 03:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
and say I've got this student and she's
 
03:58:00.189 --> 03:58:00.199 align:start position:0%
just like ready for college level
 
03:58:02.269 --> 03:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
calculus and I'm teaching fifth grade
 
03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
math can you provide me some resources
 
03:58:07.670 --> 03:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
because it's beyond me I liked calculus
 
03:58:09.309 --> 03:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
I took calculus but I can't figure out
 
03:58:11.030 --> 03:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
how to teach a fifth grade student
 
03:58:12.750 --> 03:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
calculus while I'm teaching 25 other
 
03:58:15.750 --> 03:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
students how to do actions and and some
 
03:58:18.550 --> 03:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
of them don't know their numbers yet so
 
03:58:20.590 --> 03:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
I just feel like if IID had that would
 
03:58:22.710 --> 03:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
be a better use of the money I agree
 
03:58:25.030 --> 03:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
truly gifted students and I have some
 
03:58:26.670 --> 03:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about how those would be
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
selected because we know squeaky Wheels
 
03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
get degrees and it might be just the
 
03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
most vocal parents not necessarily the
 
03:58:34.990 --> 03:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
parents of children who truly are gifted
 
03:58:37.870 --> 03:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
but truly gifted children deserve an
 
03:58:40.349 --> 03:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
education that meets their very
 
03:58:43.790 --> 03:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
different needs um and I think if if you
 
03:58:43.800 --> 03:58:44.910 align:start position:0%
different needs um and I think if if you
had

03:58:44.910 --> 03:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:58:47.229 --> 03:58:47.239 align:start position:0%
system that supported teachers in
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
meeting their needs that would help more
 
03:58:52.149 --> 03:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
students they would help every school if
 
03:58:54.429 --> 03:58:54.439 align:start position:0%
I got those resources in my school I
 
03:58:56.389 --> 03:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
could then share them two years later
 
03:58:59.070 --> 03:58:59.080 align:start position:0%
when somebody had the same issue and um
 
03:59:00.910 --> 03:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
kids wouldn't fall through the cracks
 
03:59:03.110 --> 03:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
and I do also I have worries about
 
03:59:06.469 --> 03:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
accountability in this program um as I
 
03:59:09.590 --> 03:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
read the bill it only requires providers
 
03:59:13.030 --> 03:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
to tell the department that they want
 
03:59:15.149 --> 03:59:15.159 align:start position:0%
that they want to be a provider
 
03:59:16.950 --> 03:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
and that they won't rebate money back to
 
03:59:19.510 --> 03:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
the parents and that they'll comply with
 
03:59:21.229 --> 03:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws but I don't see
 
03:59:22.750 --> 03:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
any place where it's test where they
 
03:59:25.349 --> 03:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
have to say that they have expertise in
 
03:59:27.550 --> 03:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with gifted and talented kids I
 
03:59:29.149 --> 03:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
mean I went through teaching training
 
03:59:30.870 --> 03:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
school and I didn't feel like I had that
 
03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
expertise and I worked hard on it I went
 
03:59:34.710 --> 03:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
to trainings I still didn't feel like I
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
had the expertise I needed to handle
 
03:59:38.070 --> 03:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
some of this or to meet the needs of
 
03:59:41.630 --> 03:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
some of my students completely um so I'm
 
03:59:43.349 --> 03:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
not sure who's going to who are these
 
03:59:44.269 --> 03:59:44.279 align:start position:0%
people there may be people people who
 
03:59:46.389 --> 03:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
are great at it but how do we know who's
 
03:59:48.429 --> 03:59:48.439 align:start position:0%
I didn't see anything I may have missed
 
03:59:50.070 --> 03:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
it but I didn't see anything in the bill
 
03:59:52.750 --> 03:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
that said that the uh Department would
 
03:59:56.149 --> 03:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
be reviewing these programs annually and
 
03:59:58.830 --> 03:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
and I know that often in the EFA program
 
04:00:00.790 --> 04:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
people say well the parents will be the
 
04:00:03.510 --> 04:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
judge um I can say that if I were if I
 
04:00:05.429 --> 04:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
had a child who was truly talented in
 
04:00:08.510 --> 04:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
music and played the clarinet and I sent
 
04:00:11.349 --> 04:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
them off with my scholarship money to
 
04:00:13.990 --> 04:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
get clarinet lessons I wouldn't necess
 
04:00:15.389 --> 04:00:15.399 align:start position:0%
bar know whether I could judge whether
 
04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
the lessons were really good I don't
 
04:00:20.429 --> 04:00:20.439 align:start position:0%
know enough about it and so I I worry
 
04:00:23.149 --> 04:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
about accountability for that as well I
 
04:00:25.349 --> 04:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
have other worries too but I'll stop
 
04:00:27.550 --> 04:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
here thank you very much are there
 
04:00:30.950 --> 04:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
04:00:33.990 --> 04:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
represent Luna thanks very much and and
 
04:00:35.870 --> 04:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
thanks very much um Miss wilky for
 
04:00:38.110 --> 04:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
joining us this afternoon um you talked
 
04:00:41.389 --> 04:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
about a fifth grader taking calculus but
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
let me I mean I I I would i' have to
 
04:00:48.550 --> 04:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
admit that's that's pretty speci but but
 
04:00:50.550 --> 04:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
let's just let's just move move move the
 
04:00:53.110 --> 04:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
dial up a little bit to like you know
 
04:00:55.870 --> 04:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
more like an 11th grader or 12th grader
 
04:01:00.670 --> 04:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
taking calculus and and and
 
04:01:05.790 --> 04:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
um so so yeah there's yeah every most
 
04:01:08.030 --> 04:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
high schools have kids that are in 11th
 
04:01:10.510 --> 04:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
and 12th grade some 10th graders even
 
04:01:12.229 --> 04:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
that are uh that are going to take um
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
take a Calculus class and and um uh they
 
04:01:18.349 --> 04:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
might not be gifted in woodworking they
 
04:01:20.030 --> 04:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
might not be gifted in art they might
 
04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
not be gifted in biology but they they
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
like calculus my daughter came home one
 
04:01:27.309 --> 04:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
afternoon as a senior in high school
 
04:01:29.590 --> 04:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
comes through the door and said I love
 
04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:37.550 --> 04:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
never yeah yeah yeah and uh and and she
 
04:01:40.189 --> 04:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
now works uh works for the dean at seps
 
04:01:44.469 --> 04:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
at UNH but not every school teaches
 
04:01:47.830 --> 04:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
calculus classes and and I think we
 
04:01:51.309 --> 04:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
heard earlier that that every school has
 
04:01:54.950 --> 04:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
has gifted students uh or quote gifted
 
04:01:56.670 --> 04:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
students in there maybe students that
 
04:01:59.110 --> 04:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
might want to take a Calculus class and
 
04:02:01.309 --> 04:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
would would you suggest that there are
 
04:02:03.269 --> 04:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
better ways for the state to use its
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars to to maybe help some of
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
these schools that can't afford a
 
04:02:11.389 --> 04:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
calculus teacher or can't afford to run
 
04:02:15.950 --> 04:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
these classes or maybe um uh support um
 
04:02:17.429 --> 04:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
students going to their Community
 
04:02:20.110 --> 04:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
College to uh to to take these rather
 
04:02:22.189 --> 04:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
than something that's really sort of
 
04:02:23.870 --> 04:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
unaccredited and
 
04:02:28.389 --> 04:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
un you know unever thinged so I would
 
04:02:30.590 --> 04:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
and and partly because we know that
 
04:02:32.550 --> 04:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
there will be some children who are in
 
04:02:34.710 --> 04:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
that category and they don't they don't
 
04:02:35.910 --> 04:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
get the scholarship either they don't
 
04:02:38.189 --> 04:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
know about it their parents don't
 
04:02:40.389 --> 04:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
realize that they need it their parents
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't apply somehow they fall through
 
04:02:43.550 --> 04:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
the cracks whereas if the school has the
 
04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
opport opportunity then the school will
 
04:02:47.990 --> 04:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
offer it to that child but if it's up I
 
04:02:50.750 --> 04:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
mean certainly parents want the best for
 
04:02:52.349 --> 04:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
their children but they don't always
 
04:02:54.309 --> 04:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
aren't always aware of these things like
 
04:02:56.429 --> 04:02:56.439 align:start position:0%
a scholarship out there or they might
 
04:02:58.750 --> 04:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
not be aware that their child is that
 
04:03:01.950 --> 04:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
talented in a certain subject so I feel
 
04:03:03.389 --> 04:03:03.399 align:start position:0%
like this would be a more broad-based it
 
04:03:05.870 --> 04:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
would get more children more students
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
04:03:09.510 --> 04:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
04:03:11.590 --> 04:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:03:13.910 --> 04:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question this bill
 
04:03:16.990 --> 04:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
anticipates um giving a th000
 
04:03:20.110 --> 04:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
scholarships which would be roughly one
 
04:03:23.309 --> 04:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
for every 150 kids or something like
 
04:03:26.389 --> 04:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
that is that seem to you to be in your
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
experience the kind of right ratio in
 
04:03:31.550 --> 04:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
terms of a truly exceptionally
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
intelligent student comes along sort of
 
04:03:36.070 --> 04:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't know if you had a
 
04:03:38.189 --> 04:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
class of 20 students you see one every
 
04:03:40.030 --> 04:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
seven years or something like that is
 
04:03:42.309 --> 04:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
that right or is it more of a
 
04:03:44.950 --> 04:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
Continuum where
 
04:03:47.790 --> 04:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
there's not a a sort of a noticeable
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
jump between one to the next sort yeah I
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
kind of see that as two different things
 
04:03:54.189 --> 04:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
and let me address the last thing you
 
04:03:56.830 --> 04:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
said that's another issue I have is it
 
04:03:59.110 --> 04:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
is a Continuum it's not like kids are
 
04:04:01.149 --> 04:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
get to hear and then everybody stays
 
04:04:02.030 --> 04:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
there and then all of a sudden there's
 
04:04:03.550 --> 04:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
somebody way up there there's somebody
 
04:04:04.590 --> 04:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
here there's somebody here there's
 
04:04:07.070 --> 04:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
somebody here and so there's going to be
 
04:04:10.030 --> 04:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
a cut off somehow
 
04:04:12.990 --> 04:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
and why would one child who's really a
 
04:04:15.469 --> 04:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
wonderful s singer and loves singing get
 
04:04:17.870 --> 04:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
the state to pay for his singing or his
 
04:04:20.149 --> 04:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
singing lessons and then their friend
 
04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
who is I don't know somehow rates just
 
04:04:25.870 --> 04:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
slightly more and gets in I don't know I
 
04:04:27.229 --> 04:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
don't know what the ratio is that was
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things I wondered it doesn't
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
seem like I I know that the LBA didn't
 
04:04:33.950 --> 04:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
get any information back from the um
 
04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
Department the information they
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
requested to do the fiscal note I would
 
04:04:41.389 --> 04:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
think there'd be a um statistics it
 
04:04:42.990 --> 04:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
would depend on how you defined gifted
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
of course if there's a standard
 
04:04:45.870 --> 04:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
definition and I really don't know if
 
04:04:47.670 --> 04:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
there is if there is then there must be
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
statistics on that but in my own
 
04:04:52.030 --> 04:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
experience I mean every year I would
 
04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
have well I always felt like every child
 
04:04:57.269 --> 04:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
was gifted uh and every child does have
 
04:05:02.510 --> 04:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
gifts but I me it would be I also taught
 
04:05:05.030 --> 04:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
Middle School where I had 75 children
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
every year and then I taught Elementary
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
was more like 25
 
04:05:11.950 --> 04:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
um it would be every few years I would
 
04:05:15.710 --> 04:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
see a child who was so beyond the the
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
normal range that all the usual things I
 
04:05:21.990 --> 04:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
would do to really try to make sure
 
04:05:24.349 --> 04:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
people were challenged didn't seem like
 
04:05:27.469 --> 04:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
enough and I had to really find more it

afternoon uh the next bill which we

04:05:58.750 --> 04:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
hb750 uh relative to making incentive
 
04:06:00.830 --> 04:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
grants for school districts that improve
 
04:06:08.670 --> 04:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:13.830 --> 04:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:16.149 --> 04:06:16.159 align:start position:0%
thanks again Mr

the latest report card on America's
 
04:06:29.990 --> 04:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
public education system just came out
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
last week as it has as we have it uh
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
January 29th and the numbers were
 
04:06:37.790 --> 04:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
disastrous the national assessment of
 
04:06:40.950 --> 04:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
educational progress that's the na the
 
04:06:44.149 --> 04:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
test scores were were below
 
04:06:48.030 --> 04:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh preco levels uh even as taxpayer
 
04:06:50.110 --> 04:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
spending as you know so well uh on
 
04:06:53.670 --> 04:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
schools has soared na tests carry a
 
04:06:57.349 --> 04:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
maximum 500 Point score New Hampshire's
 
04:06:57.359 --> 04:06:58.590 align:start position:0%
maximum 500 Point score New Hampshire's
eighth

04:06:58.590 --> 04:06:58.600 align:start position:0%
eighth
 
04:07:00.910 --> 04:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
graders New Hampshire 8th grade math
 
04:07:03.149 --> 04:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
scores were
 
04:07:06.189 --> 04:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
280 uh according to the 2024 test
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
results which is significantly below the
 
04:07:10.950 --> 04:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
the score of 295 from from 10 years ago
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
so anyway so there's some metrics
 
04:07:15.389 --> 04:07:15.399 align:start position:0%
there's some numbers so what can or
 
04:07:17.750 --> 04:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
should we do about this situation
 
04:07:20.070 --> 04:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
terrible situation and this terrible
 
04:07:23.469 --> 04:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
Trend in terms of academic
 
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
performance uh I've spent a couple terms
 
04:07:27.389 --> 04:07:27.399 align:start position:0%
in education committee we spent a lot of
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
time on all kinds of things uh CRT Dei
 
04:07:34.590 --> 04:07:34.600 align:start position:0%
bathroom policy cyber bully bullying
 
04:07:37.389 --> 04:07:37.399 align:start position:0%
cell phones and on and on but as a long
 
04:07:40.109 --> 04:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
time teacher Professor
 
04:07:42.990 --> 04:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
educator uh I wish we'd spend a little
 
04:07:47.590 --> 04:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
more time on learning on pedagogy on on
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge so what caner should we do to
 
04:07:52.510 --> 04:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
promote learning uh this brings us to
 
04:07:55.750 --> 04:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
hb750 and incentive grants again uh
 
04:07:58.750 --> 04:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
there's a perception that schools don't
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
sufficiently celebrate or promote
 
04:08:02.790 --> 04:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
achievement rightly or wrongly that
 
04:08:04.149 --> 04:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
perception is
 
04:08:06.590 --> 04:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
there uh why well some schools have
 
04:08:09.269 --> 04:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
eliminated valedictorians for example
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
some have done Away With Honors tracks U
 
04:08:14.269 --> 04:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
that perception that schools teach to
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
the lowest common denominator is out
 
04:08:19.229 --> 04:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
there uh for the sake of equity or
 
04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
self-esteem or what have you we've heard
 
04:08:25.229 --> 04:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
stories including in education committee
 
04:08:29.389 --> 04:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
um I remember parents coming in in
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
tears because their kids were not
 
04:08:35.469 --> 04:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
challenged in school uh In This Very
 
04:08:37.790 --> 04:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
Room I will never forget it so anyway
 
04:08:39.710 --> 04:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative Hopson and I met with
 
04:08:41.830 --> 04:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
some folks including the commissioner at
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education about the
 
04:08:46.109 --> 04:08:46.119 align:start position:0%
the incentive Grant concept uh this was
 
04:08:48.750 --> 04:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh 2 3 years ago so we talked about
 
04:08:51.070 --> 04:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
formulas and and which assessments to
 
04:08:54.349 --> 04:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
use and how to implement etc
 
04:08:58.030 --> 04:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
etc but we realized that statute is not
 
04:09:00.670 --> 04:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily the place to put in any
 
04:09:03.149 --> 04:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
lengthy prescriptive equation as to how
 
04:09:05.910 --> 04:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
to implement the incentive
 
04:09:08.229 --> 04:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
concept we saw the greater challenge
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
simply as to how to celebrate
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
Improvement and achievement how to
 
04:09:12.800 --> 04:09:13.950 align:start position:0%
Improvement and achievement how to
reward

04:09:13.950 --> 04:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
reward
 
04:09:16.149 --> 04:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
achievement and of course how to find
 
04:09:18.469 --> 04:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
funding that's why we're here funding
 
04:09:21.149 --> 04:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
and then how to task doe with working
 
04:09:22.429 --> 04:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
out the
 
04:09:25.830 --> 04:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
details in cooperation with relevant
 
04:09:28.750 --> 04:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so once a formula is
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
established for an incentive program and
 
04:09:34.070 --> 04:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
published then the schools would not
 
04:09:35.790 --> 04:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
really compete against each other they
 
04:09:38.710 --> 04:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
compete against themselves their own
 
04:09:41.189 --> 04:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
Baseline um and of course there'll be
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
some statistical issues if a school is
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
already performing well I'm anticipating
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
that question uh if the schools already
 
04:09:50.349 --> 04:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
performing relatively well then they
 
04:09:52.189 --> 04:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
have less room for improvement than a
 
04:09:53.870 --> 04:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
school that's not doing well and which
 
04:09:56.030 --> 04:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
is kind of the point the schools that
 
04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
are not doing well who do have room for
 
04:10:00.349 --> 04:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
improvement they're the ones who uh need
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
to be recognized when they do improve so
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
putting this together we shouldn't let
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
the perfect be the enemy of the good so
 
04:10:12.750 --> 04:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
as some of you know for a long time we
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
sent money lots of money many millions
 
04:10:20.309 --> 04:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
of dollars of of funds to uh schools
 
04:10:24.030 --> 04:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
that had low third grade reading scores
 
04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
and some including including the likes
 
04:10:30.149 --> 04:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
of me saw this as a perverse incentive
 
04:10:33.630 --> 04:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
schools do lousy and they get
 
04:10:37.349 --> 04:10:37.359 align:start position:0%
money and some folks thought that this
 
04:10:39.389 --> 04:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
perverse incentive uh especially when
 
04:10:40.710 --> 04:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
there's no accountability your third
 
04:10:42.990 --> 04:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
grade test scores are terrible will give
 
04:10:43.000 --> 04:10:43.870 align:start position:0%
grade test scores are terrible will give
you

04:10:43.870 --> 04:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:10:45.510 --> 04:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll just assume that you'll use
 
04:10:47.109 --> 04:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
that money to improve your third grade
 
04:10:51.670 --> 04:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
test scores terrible uh terrible concept
 
04:10:55.030 --> 04:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh which has finally been identified so
 
04:10:57.750 --> 04:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
back again to hb750 a version of this
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
came to House Education last term
 
04:11:02.710 --> 04:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
actually last couple terms two terms ago
 
04:11:05.429 --> 04:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
this concept came to House Education and
 
04:11:07.590 --> 04:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
we had an interim study
 
04:11:09.830 --> 04:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
committee of which I was on so the
 
04:11:11.710 --> 04:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
interim study committee spent a lot of
 
04:11:14.229 --> 04:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
time on this and came back to the full
 
04:11:15.750 --> 04:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
committee and most all of you know
 
04:11:18.269 --> 04:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
interim studies work so having put a lot
 
04:11:20.670 --> 04:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
of time into the interim study process
 
04:11:23.950 --> 04:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
we came back to the full committee uh in
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
October if you know how the schedule
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
works and the full education committee
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh indorse the OTP that the interim
 
04:11:33.950 --> 04:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
study committee uh recommended so you
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
have interim study OTP House Education
 
04:11:39.830 --> 04:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
in October OTP so we brought this back
 
04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh this next term which was last term uh
 
04:11:46.269 --> 04:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
some of you were here and I I was not in
 
04:11:47.670 --> 04:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
the committee at this time but it was
 
04:11:49.950 --> 04:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
amended and then tabled it was a deal
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
with tabling whatever didn't move
 
04:11:55.229 --> 04:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
forward so here we are again U Back
 
04:12:00.429 --> 04:12:00.439 align:start position:0%
Again so if and by the way uh it as part
 
04:12:01.990 --> 04:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the interim study
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
process we initially the focus was on
 
04:12:09.469 --> 04:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
all of academic and we and the the chair
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh actually the CH taking the chair's
 
04:12:14.309 --> 04:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
input we focused on
 
04:12:17.349 --> 04:12:17.359 align:start position:0%
mathematics so that's part of the
 
04:12:19.269 --> 04:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
process was listening to people like the
 
04:12:21.870 --> 04:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
chair narrowing the focus in this case
 
04:12:26.229 --> 04:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh to mathematics so if incentivizing
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
achievement and Improvement in a school
 
04:12:31.590 --> 04:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
winning a $50,000 award what what does
 
04:12:34.269 --> 04:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
that mean uh number one it means a nice
 
04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
chunk of money for the district to spend
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
as it wishes number two it means that
 
04:12:41.070 --> 04:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
the school winning the award will have
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
reason to celebrate the whole school
 
04:12:45.790 --> 04:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
Community will have reason to celebrate
 
04:12:47.590 --> 04:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
you talk about self-esteem this is
 
04:12:49.469 --> 04:12:49.479 align:start position:0%
self-esteem and morale and pride
 
04:12:52.030 --> 04:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
improving at schools that that do better
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
and are recognized and rewarded for
 
04:12:57.910 --> 04:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
doing better number three parents would
 
04:13:00.349 --> 04:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
be thrilled I guarantee that who what
 
04:13:01.950 --> 04:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
parent wouldn't be thrilled to know that
 
04:13:05.389 --> 04:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
their school with their kids their
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
youngsters go uh is working at
 
04:13:10.630 --> 04:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
Improvement and is and achieved
 
04:13:13.429 --> 04:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
Improvement via the metrics of test
 
04:13:16.189 --> 04:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
scores and and and was rewarded and
 
04:13:17.630 --> 04:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
finally number four lessons could be
 
04:13:21.790 --> 04:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
learned and shared win win win win now
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
folks might say or ask about a school
 
04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
that won an award what did you do what
 
04:13:29.630 --> 04:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
what what happened what did you do do
 
04:13:32.109 --> 04:13:32.119 align:start position:0%
differently to improve your scores and
 
04:13:35.070 --> 04:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
and to get this recognition in this
 
04:13:39.229 --> 04:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
award um so again there some you know
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
I've been I've taught on every level um
 
04:13:44.710 --> 04:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
I care about all stuff a school I once
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
taught at um in
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
Manchester had a math
 
04:13:54.349 --> 04:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
team so and they had went to math meets
 
04:13:57.349 --> 04:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
math competitions and so that's the type
 
04:13:59.550 --> 04:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
of thing that schools maybe could look
 
04:14:02.670 --> 04:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
at uh to improve math scores now uh
 
04:14:04.790 --> 04:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
maybe they could create a math club I'm
 
04:14:06.510 --> 04:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
just throwing stuff out maybe they could
 
04:14:09.550 --> 04:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
involve Al alumni parents uh accountants
 
04:14:14.670 --> 04:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
MIT grads maybe uh maybe they adopt new
 
04:14:18.109 --> 04:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
texts textbooks or or pedagogy maybe
 
04:14:20.590 --> 04:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
pull in some Engineers or technicians
 
04:14:24.109 --> 04:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
who could speak to the relevance of
 
04:14:26.429 --> 04:14:26.439 align:start position:0%
math on and on so all kinds of
 
04:14:27.990 --> 04:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
possibilities and whatever truly
 
04:14:29.590 --> 04:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
effective approaches that the
 
04:14:31.710 --> 04:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
award-winning schools came up with could
 
04:14:35.149 --> 04:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
be shared Statewide best practices so
 
04:14:38.750 --> 04:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
school any Town High School try some new
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
things improve their improves their
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
scores well what did you do share that
 
04:14:44.189 --> 04:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
and so it would be more than just the
 
04:14:47.229 --> 04:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
schools that are recognized you know
 
04:14:49.469 --> 04:14:49.479 align:start position:0%
Lessons Learned things that work share
 
04:14:49.479 --> 04:14:50.950 align:start position:0%
Lessons Learned things that work share
that

04:14:50.950 --> 04:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
elsewhere uh so an earlier version of
 
04:14:54.750 --> 04:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
this bill recommended taking a million
 
04:14:56.229 --> 04:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
dollars from the rainy day fund which
 
04:14:59.870 --> 04:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
was flush uh I know you are all in
 
04:15:02.710 --> 04:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
funding um new money for new new money
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
for Education from the rainy day fund
 
04:15:07.469 --> 04:15:07.479 align:start position:0%
now was pointed out that the rainy day
 
04:15:09.429 --> 04:15:09.439 align:start position:0%
fund was for emergencies to which I
 
04:15:12.269 --> 04:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
think I said here a place like this I
 
04:15:14.229 --> 04:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
said we keep in there's a funding crisis
 
04:15:18.830 --> 04:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
an emergency for education so uh take a
 
04:15:21.189 --> 04:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
a pit a relative pittance from the rainy
 
04:15:24.790 --> 04:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
day fund um so anyway this time around
 
04:15:27.389 --> 04:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
we're looking to redirect funds from the
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
massive education trust fund uh which
 
04:15:33.910 --> 04:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
has uh as you know better than me
 
04:15:36.189 --> 04:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
considerable dollars in
 
04:15:38.389 --> 04:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
it so I already mentioned this mod has
 
04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
come up a couple times before interim
 
04:15:44.229 --> 04:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
study OTP um and so I I just want to
 
04:15:47.309 --> 04:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
before we finish just point out that for
 
04:15:50.790 --> 04:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
the anybody who's on an interim study
 
04:15:52.710 --> 04:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
commission I've been on several you most
 
04:15:54.510 --> 04:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
of you have probably been on several you
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
put all this time in you come up with a
 
04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation the full committee adopts
 
04:16:02.309 --> 04:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
your recommendation and then uh what
 
04:16:04.990 --> 04:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
happens and if nothing happens then
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's uh that doesn't speak well of the
 
04:16:10.590 --> 04:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
process so um the last thing I'll say is
 
04:16:17.189 --> 04:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the specific details we
 
04:16:18.910 --> 04:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
get a little bit wrapped around the axle
 
04:16:21.070 --> 04:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
before talking about this which test how
 
04:16:23.710 --> 04:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
to do it what's the formula uh poor
 
04:16:26.710 --> 04:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
schools different schools uh how do you
 
04:16:29.750 --> 04:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
so the interim study team looking at
 
04:16:31.790 --> 04:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
trying to put this together finally we
 
04:16:31.800 --> 04:16:32.590 align:start position:0%
trying to put this together finally we
we

04:16:32.590 --> 04:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
recognized that as I said earlier
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
statute is not necessarily the place to
 
04:16:39.269 --> 04:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
have paragraphs and paragraphs of a
 
04:16:42.149 --> 04:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
prescriptive formula for implementing an
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
incentive Pro
 
04:16:48.109 --> 04:16:48.119 align:start position:0%
program it's uh so we are adopting what
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
we call the mission oriented
 
04:16:53.309 --> 04:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
approach uh I can best describe that is
 
04:16:55.870 --> 04:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
in the Marines you assign someone a
 
04:16:58.269 --> 04:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
mission to take the hill so you give
 
04:17:00.349 --> 04:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
them a mission you give them resources
 
04:17:01.950 --> 04:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
and then you let them work out the
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
details without you know micromanaging
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
that the a lot of times the
 
04:17:09.429 --> 04:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
micromanagement from above doesn't work
 
04:17:13.149 --> 04:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
so uh we would uh trust the stakeholders
 
04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
and whoever worked with doe to work on
 
04:17:17.950 --> 04:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
the details what we need to do simply is
 
04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
to endorse the concept the mission which
 
04:17:23.910 --> 04:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
is to improve
 
04:17:27.030 --> 04:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
learning and and provide some funding
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
and then the the details as I just said
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
the St stakeholders and thee would work
 
04:17:33.030 --> 04:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
out so thank you for your time I hope
 
04:17:35.429 --> 04:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
you'll U give this another good look and
 
04:17:37.389 --> 04:17:37.399 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions if
 
04:17:38.790 --> 04:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
there are any thank you very much
 
04:17:40.349 --> 04:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions for
 
04:17:41.950 --> 04:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
representative Moffet yes representative
 
04:17:44.389 --> 04:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:17:46.269 --> 04:17:46.279 align:start position:0%
you representative for putting the bill
 
04:17:48.670 --> 04:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
together and
 
04:17:51.149 --> 04:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
testifying my mother my late mother was
 
04:17:53.149 --> 04:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
a lifelong teacher I taught for living
 
04:17:55.550 --> 04:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
for 10 years I heard a lot of the things
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
that you were suggesting this bill could
 
04:18:02.189 --> 04:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
uh motivate I have really a simple two-p
 
04:18:04.670 --> 04:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
parted question hey isn't that the job
 
04:18:07.349 --> 04:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
of the schools to do all that in the
 
04:18:10.030 --> 04:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
first place and second if they're not
 
04:18:12.870 --> 04:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
doing it already
 
04:18:15.910 --> 04:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
would 50,000 be enough of a financial
 
04:18:17.950 --> 04:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
incentive to suddenly motivate them to
 
04:18:20.070 --> 04:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
do all this cuz my school budget is 60
 
04:18:21.990 --> 04:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
mil and I don't think if they would
 
04:18:24.149 --> 04:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
notice 50 th is anything other than a
 
04:18:26.750 --> 04:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
rounding error to be honest so I would
 
04:18:28.830 --> 04:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate your thoughts on this sure
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
04:18:33.229 --> 04:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
question in a perfect world we would not
 
04:18:36.510 --> 04:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
need policemen we would not need
 
04:18:38.429 --> 04:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
supervisors we wouldn't need incentives
 
04:18:41.189 --> 04:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
in a perfect world people would study
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
and learn for the intrinsic reward of
 
04:18:46.030 --> 04:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
learning and many do do that but this is
 
04:18:48.269 --> 04:18:48.279 align:start position:0%
not a perfect world and for a lot of
 
04:18:51.630 --> 04:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
reasons uh sociological economic I'm not
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
getting into all that lot the test
 
04:18:55.630 --> 04:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
scores that just came out last week
 
04:18:58.269 --> 04:18:58.279 align:start position:0%
document a terrible failing Nationwide
 
04:19:00.990 --> 04:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
and IND Hampshire and learning math so
 
04:19:04.030 --> 04:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
to your point I get it and I wish things
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
were I wish every parent was engaged I
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
wish every school uh maximized it its
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
resources and did did a a better job at
 
04:19:17.630 --> 04:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
teaching whatever you te in this case
 
04:19:20.750 --> 04:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
math um so the the first part of your
 
04:19:22.309 --> 04:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
question given this is not a perfect
 
04:19:24.790 --> 04:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
world uh I think there is a place for
 
04:19:27.630 --> 04:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
incentives and carrots and sticks uh
 
04:19:30.070 --> 04:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
truthfully this is a carrot big giant
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
carrot there's no stick here uh so
 
04:19:34.870 --> 04:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully that addresses your the first
 
04:19:37.309 --> 04:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
part of your question somewhat second
 
04:19:40.910 --> 04:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
part you know how much would $50,000 do
 
04:19:43.710 --> 04:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
uh well it's not what it used to be but
 
04:19:46.269 --> 04:19:46.279 align:start position:0%
I think any school uh in the towns I've
 
04:19:48.469 --> 04:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
lived in if they got a
 
04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
$50,000 reward uh they could do some
 
04:19:53.590 --> 04:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
good things with that uh again the it's
 
04:19:56.510 --> 04:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
up to the Local District but beyond the
 
04:20:00.070 --> 04:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
the dollars that would help to whatever
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
degree the the schools the morale Factor
 
04:20:08.149 --> 04:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
as I touched on earlier if a the
 
04:20:10.189 --> 04:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
Community Pride and support for public
 
04:20:12.870 --> 04:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
education would in that Community would
 
04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
ably go up and I think that's what we
 
04:20:16.109 --> 04:20:16.119 align:start position:0%
need and that's what we want this that's
 
04:20:18.149 --> 04:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
what this could do so 50 Grand or

whatever the number is uh not a gigantic
 
04:20:23.910 --> 04:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
number but it could do some good and the
 
04:20:28.670 --> 04:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
value a lot of it is uh intrinsic not
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
measurable further

04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
schedule for this afternoon HB
 
04:33:00.510 --> 04:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
772 establishing a foundation
 
04:33:03.030 --> 04:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget program for funding
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
public education I got a pink card here
 
04:33:10.590 --> 04:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
from represent luno committee Ed fun it
 
04:33:13.830 --> 04:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:16.990 --> 04:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
so welcome thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:33:18.709 --> 04:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
04:33:21.189 --> 04:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
record my name is Dave luno representing
 
04:33:24.109 --> 04:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
people who live in Mari County District
 
04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
9 uh which are the folks in in the towns
 
04:33:30.029 --> 04:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
of bow and hopkington and uh as I always
 
04:33:32.109 --> 04:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
say all across the granite state as well
 
04:33:33.709 --> 04:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
I don't give up conquered but I'll take
 
04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
everybody else too and the reason is
 
04:33:37.590 --> 04:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
because we've got statewide
 
04:33:39.709 --> 04:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and one of our biggest
 
04:33:41.310 --> 04:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
statewide responsibilities in fact I
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
dare say the biggest Statewide
 
04:33:45.789 --> 04:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
responsibility we have in New Hampshire
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
is funding our Public
 
04:33:50.310 --> 04:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
Schools there's no mistake in fact the
 
04:33:52.510 --> 04:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
the the folks on finance can correct me
 
04:33:55.990 --> 04:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
but I think I'm close I think the uh the
 
04:33:59.629 --> 04:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
state's appropriation to Public Schools
 
04:34:02.590 --> 04:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
is probably the largest discretionary if
 
04:34:05.150 --> 04:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
I can use that term right spend that we
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
have and uh there's no there's no
 
04:34:10.349 --> 04:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
questioning why um why there's an entire
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
Division division two of Finance
 
04:34:16.310 --> 04:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
dedicated to um uh to school related um
 
04:34:20.709 --> 04:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
related funding and um and you know it's
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
something that I think is as we go
 
04:34:25.029 --> 04:34:25.039 align:start position:0%
around and and knock on doors during
 
04:34:26.789 --> 04:34:26.799 align:start position:0%
campaign Seasons whether it's for us or
 
04:34:28.750 --> 04:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
for other people whether in our district
 
04:34:32.590 --> 04:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
or in other towns um people ask I think
 
04:34:33.869 --> 04:34:33.879 align:start position:0%
we've all heard it what are you doing
 
04:34:35.709 --> 04:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
about my property taxes and a lot of
 
04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
people connect that and with a follow-up
 
04:34:39.789 --> 04:34:39.799 align:start position:0%
question what are you doing about um
 
04:34:42.269 --> 04:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
school funding um
 
04:34:45.390 --> 04:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
I had the opportunity uh during this
 
04:34:48.510 --> 04:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
past campaign cycle to knock doors in
 
04:34:52.869 --> 04:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
Newport and and I I i' I'd like to say
 
04:34:54.910 --> 04:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
it was eye openening but it wasn't
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
because I know a lot about um what's
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
going on in Newport with with how
 
04:35:00.390 --> 04:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
they're funding schools and what their
 
04:35:03.750 --> 04:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
challenges are and what their um um
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
school and student characteristics are
 
04:35:10.349 --> 04:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
like and um and you know and I can see
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
from our current
 
04:35:15.429 --> 04:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
funding formula that uh we've talked
 
04:35:17.670 --> 04:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
about in the past it's one siiz fits all
 
04:35:20.789 --> 04:35:20.799 align:start position:0%
you get the same base adequacy and
 
04:35:24.429 --> 04:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
differentiated you know Aid package
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
whether you're uh whether you're a
 
04:35:29.109 --> 04:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
student um uh whether you're going to a
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
school in Newport per student or whether
 
04:35:33.670 --> 04:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to school in uh in wolfboro
 
04:35:38.830 --> 04:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
or Newcastle and um and and and and our
 
04:35:42.109 --> 04:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
current funding formula has been
 
04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
described as um as having two sides to
 
04:35:48.949 --> 04:35:48.959 align:start position:0%
it a leftand side and a right hand side
 
04:35:50.590 --> 04:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
and I think of I've got him right the
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
leftand side is adequacy it's must pay
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
it's what it's what comes out of our
 
04:35:58.429 --> 04:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
formula it's what comes out of our
 
04:36:01.390 --> 04:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligations the right
 
04:36:04.869 --> 04:36:04.879 align:start position:0%
side has almost as much money in it it
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
seems and is used to prop up the
 
04:36:10.349 --> 04:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula with the extraordinary
 
04:36:12.949 --> 04:36:12.959 align:start position:0%
needs Grant and supplementals Grant
 
04:36:14.510 --> 04:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
supplemental grants and we're talking
 
04:36:16.709 --> 04:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
about doing it again this year too and I
 
04:36:18.629 --> 04:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
think we you know it it certainly is
 
04:36:20.590 --> 04:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
very helpful and it's very helpful to a
 
04:36:22.349 --> 04:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
lot of schools including Manchester and
 
04:36:22.359 --> 04:36:23.269 align:start position:0%
lot of schools including Manchester and
including

04:36:23.269 --> 04:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
including
 
04:36:26.349 --> 04:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
Newport um but what I'm here to talk
 
04:36:29.269 --> 04:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
about today is a new way of looking at
 
04:36:31.949 --> 04:36:31.959 align:start position:0%
things and representative spillsbury put
 
04:36:35.070 --> 04:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
it on the table um yesterday I think
 
04:36:36.670 --> 04:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe it was Friday last week and
 
04:36:39.390 --> 04:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
said hey can we look at maybe look at
 
04:36:41.670 --> 04:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
things a different way and see what
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
might work for um for the granite state
 
04:36:46.830 --> 04:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 77 uh
 
04:36:52.150 --> 04:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
772 does that and um and and it does it
 
04:36:54.670 --> 04:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
in um in three ways and now I'm
 
04:36:58.510 --> 04:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
referring to the the explainer that I uh
 
04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
that I put at everybody's seat so uh so
 
04:37:04.510 --> 04:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
for a for afternoon Bill introduction um
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
it'll help us get get through this um
 
04:37:10.990 --> 04:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
but uh it does three things it does
 
04:37:12.590 --> 04:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
School funding
 
04:37:15.629 --> 04:37:15.639 align:start position:0%
reform not just tweaking the same you
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
know um package that that we've the
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
school funding formula we've got in
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
place now school funding reform it does
 
04:37:25.949 --> 04:37:25.959 align:start position:0%
it reforms the Statewide education
 
04:37:29.551 --> 04:37:29.561 align:start position:0%
property tax and it also implements a
 
04:37:31.590 --> 04:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
low and moderate property tax relief
 
04:37:34.029 --> 04:37:34.039 align:start position:0%
program I'm not so much going to talk
 
04:37:36.269 --> 04:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
about these last two things I'll talk a
 
04:37:39.429 --> 04:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
little bit about them but um but uh we
 
04:37:41.910 --> 04:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
heard we heard from representative names
 
04:37:43.789 --> 04:37:43.799 align:start position:0%
last week when he introduced um House
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 734 that that this bill
 
04:37:49.230 --> 04:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
incorporates um uh in its entirety for
 
04:37:51.390 --> 04:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
those last two items but let's talk
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
about the um the the school funding
 
04:37:59.230 --> 04:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
reform part what what came out
 
04:37:59.240 --> 04:38:01.750 align:start position:0%
reform part what what came out
of

04:38:01.750 --> 04:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:38:05.390 --> 04:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
Claremont The Claremont decisions is um
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
is what's What's called the the the four
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
I guess four mandates that came out of
 
04:38:15.150 --> 04:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
Claremont and the first mandate is
 
04:38:17.109 --> 04:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
Define inadequate education this is the
 
04:38:18.670 --> 04:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
job for the legislature all four of
 
04:38:20.429 --> 04:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
these things it's the job for the
 
04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
legislature legislature must Define an
 
04:38:28.709 --> 04:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
adequate anuc Define an adequate
 
04:38:31.510 --> 04:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
education the second thing is the
 
04:38:34.429 --> 04:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
legislature has to cost it what's it
 
04:38:36.470 --> 04:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
going to cost to put on that
 
04:38:36.480 --> 04:38:38.029 align:start position:0%
going to cost to put on that
program

04:38:38.029 --> 04:38:38.039 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:38:42.789 --> 04:38:42.799 align:start position:0%
for 161,000 students across the state
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
through a bunch of school districts and
 
04:38:48.070 --> 04:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
funding for school districts to run that
 
04:38:58.470 --> 04:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
program none of them are going to run
 
04:39:01.789 --> 04:39:01.799 align:start position:0%
out of you know lack the resources or
 
04:39:04.629 --> 04:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
lack access to the resources they need
 
04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
to fund their schools that's the third
 
04:39:09.670 --> 04:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
thing and the fourth thing is an
 
04:39:12.910 --> 04:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
accountability package
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
how do we know that the schools are
 
04:39:15.709 --> 04:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
doing the job how do we know how well
 
04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
the kids are doing um how do we report
 
04:39:20.510 --> 04:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
04:39:20.520 --> 04:39:22.109 align:start position:0%
back to the
taxpayers

04:39:22.109 --> 04:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
04:39:24.629 --> 04:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
that that our students are about our
 
04:39:24.639 --> 04:39:25.551 align:start position:0%
that that our students are about our
student

04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:39:27.390 --> 04:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
performance and we heard a little bit
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
about that earlier today too through
 
04:39:31.629 --> 04:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
through the um Nationwide National
 
04:39:34.230 --> 04:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
assessment Nate uh and we'll talk about
 
04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
that in a little bit but it's these four
 
04:39:40.948 --> 04:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
things that uh that that came out of the
 
04:39:45.550 --> 04:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
clar decisions and direct us in the
 
04:39:48.110 --> 04:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
legislature on what to do what are
 
04:39:49.868 --> 04:39:49.878 align:start position:0%
responsible what our constitutional
 
04:39:52.230 --> 04:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are to funding school
 
04:39:54.670 --> 04:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
so what does 772 do that's different
 
04:39:58.150 --> 04:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
than than uh than our one siiz fits-all
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
thing that we do do today well first of
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
all it
 
04:40:06.110 --> 04:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
um it defines the opportunity for an
 
04:40:06.120 --> 04:40:07.190 align:start position:0%
um it defines the opportunity for an
adequate

04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
education um as being two things the
 
04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
first thing the content areas that are
 
04:40:16.350 --> 04:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
already described in rsa1 193
 
04:40:19.270 --> 04:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
e2a and um we've talked a lot about
 
04:40:21.390 --> 04:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
those in the past and we've even added
 
04:40:24.190 --> 04:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
to them in the last um last couple of
 
04:40:24.200 --> 04:40:25.868 align:start position:0%
to them in the last um last couple of
years

04:40:25.868 --> 04:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:40:29.150 --> 04:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
um so it's got the substantive content
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
areas uh but it
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
also defines it for every District to
 
04:40:40.788 --> 04:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
have to be able to educate their
 
04:40:40.798 --> 04:40:42.270 align:start position:0%
have to be able to educate their
students

04:40:42.270 --> 04:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:40:44.270 --> 04:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
to a Statewide
 
04:40:47.470 --> 04:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
outcome so it's got a student outcome
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
component uh to this and that's really
 
04:40:52.390 --> 04:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
important especially important in New
 
04:40:55.550 --> 04:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because overall Statewide and
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
we're hear about this I hope there's a
 
04:41:01.510 --> 04:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
card that's going to come in um and and
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
and because overall Statewide our our
 
04:41:06.868 --> 04:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
students perform among the best in the
 
04:41:10.190 --> 04:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
country I'm I'm here in top five I heard
 
04:41:13.948 --> 04:41:13.958 align:start position:0%
top four from representative bricky uh
 
04:41:17.230 --> 04:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
during lunch today um uh Governor sonunu
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
said top five a year ago so but it's
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
right around in there and I think the uh
 
04:41:24.550 --> 04:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
the the scores we're going to hear about
 
04:41:27.990 --> 04:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
also U support that uh position so so
 
04:41:30.270 --> 04:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide outcomes are a strong outcome
 
04:41:31.750 --> 04:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire but it's just not
 
04:41:34.270 --> 04:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
happening everywhere and and we heard
 
04:41:38.670 --> 04:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
from um from the superintendent Newport
 
04:41:40.990 --> 04:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
this morning that it's not happening
 
04:41:41.000 --> 04:41:42.150 align:start position:0%
this morning that it's not happening
there

04:41:42.150 --> 04:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:41:43.868 --> 04:41:43.878 align:start position:0%
it's happening in a lot of other places
 
04:41:45.310 --> 04:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
but it's not happening in Newport it's
 
04:41:46.628 --> 04:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
not happening in
 
04:41:49.230 --> 04:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester and when it doesn't happen in
 
04:41:50.830 --> 04:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
when it does happen in Newport it's
 
04:41:52.708 --> 04:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
definitely a problem I mean it's a
 
04:41:54.788 --> 04:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
problem when it's not happening in
 
04:41:57.070 --> 04:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester it's definitely a problem
 
04:41:59.628 --> 04:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
it's a big problem because there's
 
04:42:01.628 --> 04:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
13,000 kids there's thousand kids that
 
04:42:04.628 --> 04:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
graduate every year from Manchester and
 
04:42:05.670 --> 04:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh when the average student in
 
04:42:08.750 --> 04:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester is is not performing at a at
 
04:42:11.310 --> 04:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
a Statewide proficiency level then uh
 
04:42:13.830 --> 04:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
then that's a real issue so um so we
 
04:42:17.948 --> 04:42:17.958 align:start position:0%
Define it as content areas and in terms
 
04:42:20.708 --> 04:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
of student student outcomes the second
 
04:42:23.070 --> 04:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
thing all right now we got to cost this
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
thing what's it what's it going to cost
 
04:42:30.230 --> 04:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
so so and and this actually comes out of
 
04:42:31.788 --> 04:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
the I hold it up all the time the
 
04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
commission report how to go about
 
04:42:38.270 --> 04:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
costing um uh an adequate education
 
04:42:41.390 --> 04:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
based on based on student outcomes and
 
04:42:43.948 --> 04:42:43.958 align:start position:0%
so it calculates what's called a
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget which
 
04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
isn't you know the base cost of adequacy
 
04:42:52.430 --> 04:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
with a bunch of little differentiated uh
 
04:42:54.910 --> 04:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
things it's the budget that a school
 
04:42:56.350 --> 04:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
district would
 
04:42:59.868 --> 04:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
need so that all to well let me say
 
04:43:01.470 --> 04:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
another it's the budget a school
 
04:43:04.110 --> 04:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
district needs to educate all of its
 
04:43:09.750 --> 04:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:13.310 --> 04:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:16.230 --> 04:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
um when looking at that that that
 
04:43:18.628 --> 04:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
Statewide outcome now you can look at
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
the average student in this district and
 
04:43:23.788 --> 04:43:23.798 align:start position:0%
the average student in Manchester I mean
 
04:43:25.670 --> 04:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
this is the budget budget for Manchester
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
so the average student in Manchester
 
04:43:31.350 --> 04:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
would be performing very close to the
 
04:43:33.390 --> 04:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
same level as the average student in
 
04:43:37.390 --> 04:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson or the average student in
 
04:43:39.948 --> 04:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
Handover um so that's the second thing
 
04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
it does differently then our one size
 
04:43:48.110 --> 04:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
fits all the third thing um it does is
 
04:43:51.788 --> 04:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
fund it and how do we go about um how do
 
04:43:56.190 --> 04:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
we go about funding this well in a sense
 
04:43:59.948 --> 04:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
what what what we're doing in our in our
 
04:44:02.270 --> 04:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
current model is we start with State
 
04:44:05.470 --> 04:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
dollars the 4100 base plus the little
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know sparse little bits of
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
differentiate Aid and everybody gets
 
04:44:12.910 --> 04:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
that and then the locals uh put in the
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
rest of the money to get them to uh to
 
04:44:17.628 --> 04:44:17.638 align:start position:0%
get them to the school budget um 772
 
04:44:20.270 --> 04:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
turns out on its head it starts with a
 
04:44:24.868 --> 04:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
modest uh local share and I think 77
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
772 talks about
 
04:44:30.990 --> 04:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
$538 do I have that right um per
 
04:44:34.190 --> 04:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
thousand and um and and only if you need
 
04:44:38.708 --> 04:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
only if you know $538 per thousand um
 
04:44:40.510 --> 04:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't get if it if that's more than
 
04:44:42.310 --> 04:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
you need to get to your foundation
 
04:44:44.110 --> 04:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget then you can stop you
 
04:44:47.510 --> 04:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
don't need to put in all $538 per
 
04:44:51.190 --> 04:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
thousand but um but it starts with that
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
and and if if in your town that gets you
 
04:45:00.670 --> 04:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
to your your foundation opportunity
 
04:45:02.550 --> 04:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
budget or your share of the foundation
 
04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget um then then you're
 
04:45:08.350 --> 04:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
done then that's great
 
04:45:11.550 --> 04:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
$538 that's all you need uh ,000 that's
 
04:45:13.510 --> 04:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
all you need for um for prop or less
 
04:45:14.788 --> 04:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
than that that's all you need for
 
04:45:17.628 --> 04:45:17.638 align:start position:0%
property taxes but if that doesn't get
 
04:45:19.788 --> 04:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
you there and in most districts it's not
 
04:45:21.830 --> 04:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
going to get you there that's where the
 
04:45:24.788 --> 04:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
state comes in with the adequacy Grant
 
04:45:27.310 --> 04:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
and gets you the rest of the
 
04:45:31.788 --> 04:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
way so local dollars First State dollars
 
04:45:33.788 --> 04:45:33.798 align:start position:0%
get you the rest of the way rather than
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
rather than uh rather than backwards um
 
04:45:40.430 --> 04:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
and um and that's probably the biggest
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
thing F Well if I were to say two really
 
04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
big things about Foundation opportunity
 
04:45:47.830 --> 04:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
plan it's centered on Focus focused on
 
04:45:52.390 --> 04:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
student outcomes and paid for in a way
 
04:45:54.830 --> 04:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
that lives up to our constitutional
 
04:45:57.070 --> 04:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
requirement where the state guarantees
 
04:45:59.310 --> 04:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
the resources you
 
04:46:01.750 --> 04:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
need not the locals guaranteeing the
 
04:46:03.788 --> 04:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
resources you need State guarantees the
 
04:46:07.150 --> 04:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
resources you need and it also has a um
 
04:46:09.708 --> 04:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
uh an accountability and and um data
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
collection system uh also in the bill
 
04:46:15.430 --> 04:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
the Bill's 26 or so pages
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
long what are we at well it's 24 on this
 
04:46:22.788 --> 04:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
it um uh so there's a lot to it and and
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know I think hope you know when we
 
04:46:30.270 --> 04:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
when we hold the um uh the work sessions
 
04:46:31.708 --> 04:46:31.718 align:start position:0%
that we'll really be able to sort of
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
crank into this we do not have a fiscal
 
04:46:36.750 --> 04:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
note of the chair and I have have been
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
speaking with the department and the LBA
 
04:46:42.190 --> 04:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
about where they're at and uh I think
 
04:46:44.750 --> 04:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
they're more than a week away from
 
04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
having a having a fiscal note obviously
 
04:46:49.948 --> 04:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
the sooner the better um we've put uh
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
we've put similar bills in in the past
 
04:46:56.708 --> 04:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
so I generally have have have um have a
 
04:46:59.548 --> 04:46:59.558 align:start position:0%
sense as to what the fiscal note would
 
04:47:03.788 --> 04:47:03.798 align:start position:0%
be and you know the first the the the
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
the two bills that I've introduced over
 
04:47:08.310 --> 04:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
the last week uh talking about you know
 
04:47:10.590 --> 04:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
an increase to the base using the conval
 
04:47:12.670 --> 04:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
number and then an increase to the base
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
plus the differentiated U grants based
 
04:47:18.190 --> 04:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
on conval and and ran I think
 
04:47:20.910 --> 04:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
respectively added 500 million close to
 
04:47:25.270 --> 04:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
500 454 million and then 630 million to
 
04:47:28.270 --> 04:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
current law um earlier versions of this
 
04:47:30.190 --> 04:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
bill that had little bit of a different
 
04:47:33.150 --> 04:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
taper little bit of a different um um
 
04:47:35.628 --> 04:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
base than what we're we're in right now
 
04:47:39.230 --> 04:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
um added 200 was 20 million over current
 
04:47:41.670 --> 04:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
law so as the state state starts to
 
04:47:43.628 --> 04:47:43.638 align:start position:0%
spend break out of this one siiz
 
04:47:46.670 --> 04:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
fits-all and starts to spend its money
 
04:47:50.548 --> 04:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
distribute its money in a smarter way um
 
04:47:52.310 --> 04:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
that overall price comes down because
 
04:47:55.310 --> 04:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
we're not talking 90 grand going to um
 
04:47:55.320 --> 04:47:57.150 align:start position:0%
we're not talking 90 grand going to um
to

04:47:57.150 --> 04:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:48:02.788 --> 04:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
Newcastle right so um so anyway the the
 
04:48:06.110 --> 04:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
the price tag comes down a lot uh I'm
 
04:48:10.470 --> 04:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
I'm very interested to uh to see uh What
 
04:48:12.948 --> 04:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh the fiscal note does come come out
 
04:48:15.788 --> 04:48:15.798 align:start position:0%
with and and Mr chair I hope also we'll
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to work with with Mr
 
04:48:21.270 --> 04:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
landrian on on a fiscal note that may
 
04:48:23.548 --> 04:48:23.558 align:start position:0%
have a town by town in there too because
 
04:48:25.110 --> 04:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
I think that's a that's a really
 
04:48:27.788 --> 04:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
important component to this like I said
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
earlier versions saw substantial
 
04:48:33.750 --> 04:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
movement in uh in towns that had have
 
04:48:36.868 --> 04:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
historically been left out and um and so
 
04:48:37.948 --> 04:48:37.958 align:start position:0%
I think it's something we all need to
 
04:48:39.830 --> 04:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
see it's also worth talking about
 
04:48:41.310 --> 04:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
because I'm not going to talk about the
 
04:48:42.830 --> 04:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
swept reform I'm not going to talk about
 
04:48:45.030 --> 04:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
low and moderate income um because we
 
04:48:46.830 --> 04:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
talked about that uh last week with
 
04:48:50.070 --> 04:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
representative Ames um but what's also
 
04:48:55.110 --> 04:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:57.670 --> 04:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
772 there's no
 
04:49:00.548 --> 04:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
stabilization there's no hold
 
04:49:03.230 --> 04:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
harmless there's nothing that props up
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
the formula the formula
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
works now to be fair it does and and
 
04:49:12.430 --> 04:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
this isn't n necessary necessary for the
 
04:49:15.628 --> 04:49:15.638 align:start position:0%
formula to work it does have a provision
 
04:49:18.590 --> 04:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
for tax transition
 
04:49:24.230 --> 04:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
grants so as as the As and and it has
 
04:49:27.190 --> 04:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
a it's either an eight or a 10-year
 
04:49:29.708 --> 04:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
phase in Period so this isn't a drop it
 
04:49:33.030 --> 04:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
all at once you know type of thing we we
 
04:49:35.310 --> 04:49:35.320 align:start position:0%
realize that that you know this is
 
04:49:37.230 --> 04:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
something that that that's got to be
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
tapered in that has to be phased in um I
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
I you know I suppose if we were to ask a
 
04:49:44.150 --> 04:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
superintendent what would happen if we
 
04:49:46.230 --> 04:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
dropped a pile of cash you know on your
 
04:49:47.788 --> 04:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
lap would you be able to spend it all in
 
04:49:49.868 --> 04:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
year one you know a lot of them say yeah
 
04:49:51.628 --> 04:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
maybe we could but but I think we all
 
04:49:54.350 --> 04:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
know practically from business about you
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
know how you how you work with with
 
04:49:59.350 --> 04:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
funding and tranches of money and um and
 
04:50:01.310 --> 04:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
so I think this this has a smart
 
04:50:04.430 --> 04:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
delivery and phase in of that similarly
 
04:50:07.390 --> 04:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
and make sure that nobody gets hurt so
 
04:50:09.788 --> 04:50:09.798 align:start position:0%
um um so and it does it all without
 
04:50:12.708 --> 04:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
stabilization without a prop to hold up
 
04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
um to prop up the formula uh so in the
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
long run the formula operates by itself
 
04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
without an extraordinary needs Grant or
 
04:50:22.990 --> 04:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Grant or any
 
04:50:25.350 --> 04:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
of these other stabilization props we've
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
used um in the past um so uh just for
 
04:50:33.470 --> 04:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
just for a minute I want to make sure
 
04:50:35.750 --> 04:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
that that everybody got a copy we did
 
04:50:38.590 --> 04:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
get a uh what's called a a a fiscal note
 
04:50:40.830 --> 04:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
quick guide from the from the the
 
04:50:42.590 --> 04:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue which I think is
 
04:50:45.548 --> 04:50:45.558 align:start position:0%
terrific uh I talked with Mr canu about
 
04:50:47.310 --> 04:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
it briefly because there's some comments
 
04:50:49.868 --> 04:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
on here that say and and you know and
 
04:50:51.470 --> 04:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
they got a lot of bills obviously to go
 
04:50:54.070 --> 04:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
through but some comments that sometimes
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
in some cases throughout the bill we use
 
04:50:57.948 --> 04:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
the word you know City town or
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
municipality other places we use the
 
04:51:02.350 --> 04:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
word District those are two very
 
04:51:03.788 --> 04:51:03.798 align:start position:0%
distinct things we were not
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
indiscriminate about how we um use those
 
04:51:09.310 --> 04:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
terms in the bill when um when when
 
04:51:12.430 --> 04:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
looking at um at at a
 
04:51:16.230 --> 04:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
municipality's uh um obligation or
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
building out its share of the foundation
 
04:51:20.910 --> 04:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget we're using the admr
 
04:51:22.750 --> 04:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
per town so per
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
municipality um when calculating uh some
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
of the costs including the uh the school
 
04:51:31.070 --> 04:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
district size we would use the word
 
04:51:35.070 --> 04:51:35.080 align:start position:0%
District um in there so so U uh I'm not
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
saying that in a 24-page bill that there
 
04:51:39.830 --> 04:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be some some drafting
 
04:51:43.708 --> 04:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
errors on the part of myself and and and
 
04:51:46.350 --> 04:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
there may be some that that that I'm not
 
04:51:48.670 --> 04:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
saying it's perfect but I'm saying that
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
that that with with with full intention
 
04:51:54.750 --> 04:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
to to understand and recognize and
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
utilize the difference between those
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
terms uh in there um the uh the last
 
04:52:04.670 --> 04:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to talk about in fact if
 
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
there's another card coming in then I'm
 
04:52:11.150 --> 04:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
going to leave most of it um to the next
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
speaker but um but but when we when we
 
04:52:19.150 --> 04:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at the um at the ranking of
 
04:52:23.430 --> 04:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
nape um test scores um reading in math
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
for fourth graders and eighth graders
 
04:52:27.628 --> 04:52:27.638 align:start position:0%
that came out last week and if you rank
 
04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
them by um by by score from the highest
 
04:52:35.110 --> 04:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
to the lowest um you'll see a pattern
 
04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
that that I think the chair has um has
 
04:52:41.868 --> 04:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
noticed before as well and um and I
 
04:52:44.110 --> 04:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
think we could probably all without too
 
04:52:48.150 --> 04:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
much trouble um guess the names of the
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
school districts that are on the top of
 
04:52:53.350 --> 04:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
that list and the ones that are on the
 
04:52:58.350 --> 04:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
bottom of that list and um and they all
 
04:53:01.230 --> 04:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
uh have bearing on how the state goes
 
04:53:01.240 --> 04:53:02.628 align:start position:0%
uh have bearing on how the state goes
about

04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:53:04.990 --> 04:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
um funding our
 
04:53:08.070 --> 04:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
schools and and you know none of us I
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
think want to be you know on the bottom
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
of of the nape score list whether you're
 
04:53:15.948 --> 04:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
a taxpayer in Newport who's paying some
 
04:53:17.670 --> 04:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the highest or Charlestown paying
 
04:53:19.030 --> 04:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
some of the highest property taxes in
 
04:53:20.270 --> 04:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
the state I'm not sure who's higher
 
04:53:22.590 --> 04:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
right now Newport or Charlestown
 
04:53:26.830 --> 04:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
Charlestown is yeah so um so you know if
 
04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
you're taxpayer you don't want to be on
 
04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom of that list if you're a
 
04:53:31.628 --> 04:53:31.638 align:start position:0%
student if you're a parent you don't
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
want to be on the bottom of the list and
 
04:53:34.270 --> 04:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
certainly if you're a student you don't
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
want to be on the bottom of that
 
04:53:38.830 --> 04:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
list so
 
04:53:43.030 --> 04:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
um with that I'll um sort of wrap up and
 
04:53:47.788 --> 04:53:47.798 align:start position:0%
and I think we can do a lot to adopt a a
 
04:53:50.430 --> 04:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh funding model that is based on
 
04:53:53.548 --> 04:53:53.558 align:start position:0%
Research based on evidence based on data
 
04:53:56.430 --> 04:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
based on on how many hours did we meet
 
04:53:59.948 --> 04:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
at least 250 hours Mr chair back in 2020
 
04:54:02.350 --> 04:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
on the school funding uh commission work
 
04:54:05.590 --> 04:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
based on testimony uh that we received
 
04:54:08.350 --> 04:54:08.360 align:start position:0%
um all over the country uh we had most
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
of our meetings with zoom which meant we
 
04:54:14.030 --> 04:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
bring people in um uh uh National
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
experts in um uh in a lot of different
 
04:54:19.590 --> 04:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
areas whether it was uh education policy
 
04:54:24.150 --> 04:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
school funding policy tax policy and um
 
04:54:24.160 --> 04:54:25.830 align:start position:0%
school funding policy tax policy and um
and

04:54:25.830 --> 04:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:30.788 --> 04:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
um anyway uh we're able to we're able to
 
04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
offer something that breaks us out of
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
the one siiz fits-all and something uh
 
04:54:39.230 --> 04:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
you know a lot more um Dynamic that that
 
04:54:41.628 --> 04:54:41.638 align:start position:0%
recognizes the uh the different
 
04:54:45.868 --> 04:54:45.878 align:start position:0%
challenges in different um um in
 
04:54:47.390 --> 04:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
different cities and towns that we have
 
04:54:49.390 --> 04:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
across the state so with that I'll take
 
04:54:52.910 --> 04:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I'll take some questions but but but
 
04:54:54.670 --> 04:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
you know save your save the best ones
 
04:54:58.190 --> 04:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
for the work session please represent
 
04:55:00.390 --> 04:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:55:03.510 --> 04:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
you for a detailed introduction to a
 
04:55:06.670 --> 04:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
very detailed bill um I have a quick
 
04:55:09.628 --> 04:55:09.638 align:start position:0%
question um in your early discussion of
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
the formula you said that the left side
 
04:55:13.990 --> 04:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
of the formula is the adequacy and the
 
04:55:15.990 --> 04:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
right side is I believe you said a
 
04:55:17.590 --> 04:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
supplement to it or something along
 
04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
those lines can you help me understand
 
04:55:22.868 --> 04:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
which in your opinion are the components
 
04:55:24.510 --> 04:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
of the right side of the education
 
04:55:27.670 --> 04:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
formula that are not needed for adequacy
 
04:55:30.510 --> 04:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education yeah so so
 
04:55:32.590 --> 04:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question my understanding
 
04:55:35.070 --> 04:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
is that is that
 
04:55:35.080 --> 04:55:37.390 align:start position:0%
is that is that
um

04:55:37.390 --> 04:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:40.390 --> 04:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
1984a is that the
 
04:55:41.628 --> 04:55:41.638 align:start position:0%
the formula you're talking about
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
statutory yes statutory reference
 
04:55:46.910 --> 04:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
1984a is the is the costing of an
 
04:55:50.310 --> 04:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
adequate education anything outside of
 
04:55:54.948 --> 04:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
1984a is not considered to be the uh
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
constitutionally um costing of an
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
adequate education quick clarification
 
04:56:03.270 --> 04:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
if I may and is there any part of the
 
04:56:05.070 --> 04:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
funds that we allocate on the right side
 
04:56:07.110 --> 04:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
of the formula that does not go
 
04:56:09.310 --> 04:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
specifically towards addressing those
 
04:56:13.948 --> 04:56:13.958 align:start position:0%
1984 the obligations I I so I I believe
 
04:56:16.270 --> 04:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant is outside
 
04:56:18.590 --> 04:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
of that I think that's considered right
 
04:56:20.070 --> 04:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
right side of the
 
04:56:23.628 --> 04:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
formula I believe yes um there may I
 
04:56:25.990 --> 04:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
think there was there another grant that
 
04:56:29.150 --> 04:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
that was added in the last
 
04:56:32.350 --> 04:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
um well we've talked about like re
 
04:56:35.310 --> 04:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
relief Grant yeah we talked about fiscal
 
04:56:38.150 --> 04:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
capacity yeah um those are all right
 
04:56:39.868 --> 04:56:39.878 align:start position:0%
side and then of course you got the hold
 
04:56:43.708 --> 04:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
harm on that side of the formula yeah
 
04:56:43.718 --> 04:56:45.628 align:start position:0%
harm on that side of the formula yeah
and

04:56:45.628 --> 04:56:45.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:49.868 --> 04:56:49.878 align:start position:0%
um see the other one was
 
04:56:54.390 --> 04:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh so other grants yeah they're they're
 
04:56:57.030 --> 04:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
they're made I'm just not yeah but but I
 
04:56:59.150 --> 04:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
think the biggies are the ones that you
 
04:57:02.708 --> 04:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
just listed off Mr chair the the um the
 
04:57:04.270 --> 04:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant and the home
 
04:57:07.270 --> 04:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
hold harmless and uh and I don't believe
 
04:57:13.470 --> 04:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:16.548 --> 04:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
1984a thank you and may I have a very
 
04:57:19.910 --> 04:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
short second question thank you Mr chair
 
04:57:23.470 --> 04:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
the other thing I was looking at your U
 
04:57:25.670 --> 04:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
explainer uh it says that we should
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
calculate the foundation opportunity
 
04:57:29.310 --> 04:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
budget based on the actual
 
04:57:32.390 --> 04:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
costs right now I come from a school
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
district that Prides on providing an
 
04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
education level that's Way Beyond the
 
04:57:38.910 --> 04:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
adequate right I I'm from wiam how would
 
04:57:41.990 --> 04:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
we go about in if we look at the Windham
 
04:57:44.670 --> 04:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
educational expenses how much of that is
 
04:57:46.708 --> 04:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
spent for the adequate education that
 
04:57:48.788 --> 04:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
the state requires and how much you
 
04:57:51.110 --> 04:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
spent for the choices of my local
 
04:57:52.990 --> 04:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to go above and beyond
 
04:57:55.230 --> 04:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
adequate sure no that's a great question
 
04:57:56.590 --> 04:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
and that's where the student outcome
 
04:57:59.310 --> 04:57:59.320 align:start position:0%
Factor comes uh comes in so we would
 
04:58:01.070 --> 04:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
take a look at what the what the student
 
04:58:05.430 --> 04:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes are in in Windom and um and and
 
04:58:07.990 --> 04:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
take a look at what costs in what
 
04:58:13.548 --> 04:58:13.558 align:start position:0%
category um when it it you know in what
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
costs in what categories because schools
 
04:58:18.548 --> 04:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
do a bunch of different different things
 
04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
and what types of students they're um
 
04:58:22.868 --> 04:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
they're educating so so how many
 
04:58:25.548 --> 04:58:25.558 align:start position:0%
students are um are from low income
 
04:58:27.590 --> 04:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
backgrounds how many have special educa
 
04:58:29.190 --> 04:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
been identified special education how
 
04:58:31.670 --> 04:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
many English language Learners what size
 
04:58:36.270 --> 04:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
your your school is um and um and when
 
04:58:38.868 --> 04:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
looking at that looking at that dat
 
04:58:40.590 --> 04:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
these data those data
 
04:58:43.030 --> 04:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
from every school district uh around the
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
state you can start to see how well geez
 
04:58:50.510 --> 04:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
so we we can see in Newport that that
 
04:58:54.430 --> 04:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
their student outcomes are are here and
 
04:58:56.470 --> 04:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
that they've got a very high I think
 
04:58:59.868 --> 04:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
Newport has a fairly high percentage of
 
04:59:01.390 --> 04:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
um of of students who' have been
 
04:59:04.750 --> 04:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
identified as special education and and
 
04:59:07.150 --> 04:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
so you can take a look at the spending
 
04:59:09.230 --> 04:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
look at how they've you know through
 
04:59:13.230 --> 04:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
through the um the um uh doe 25 the end
 
04:59:15.750 --> 04:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
of the year doe2 is end of the year
 
04:59:19.390 --> 04:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
actual yes end of the year actual and um
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
and and through an analysis be able to
 
04:59:24.750 --> 04:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
determine what spending Works in what
 
04:59:27.830 --> 04:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
areas and um and then and then determine
 
04:59:32.070 --> 04:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
a budget based on um u based on based on
 
04:59:35.190 --> 04:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
these data to get to get a Statewide um
 
04:59:38.150 --> 04:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
student outcome thank you further
 
04:59:38.160 --> 04:59:41.110 align:start position:0%
student outcome thank you further
questions

04:59:41.110 --> 04:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:46.080 --> 04:59:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
Ames

04:59:47.830 --> 04:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
04:59:47.840 --> 04:59:49.548 align:start position:0%
Ames
uh

04:59:49.548 --> 04:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:59:52.230 --> 04:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
so I know because I've been involved in
 
04:59:54.708 --> 04:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
this but I I wonder if you could speak a
 
04:59:56.910 --> 04:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
little more
 
05:00:00.628 --> 05:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
about how this this bill this approach
 
05:00:02.868 --> 05:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
to funding the public
 
05:00:02.878 --> 05:00:04.750 align:start position:0%
to funding the public
schools

05:00:04.750 --> 05:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:00:08.070 --> 05:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
um would
 
05:00:11.470 --> 05:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
operate if adopted and if operating
 
05:00:13.270 --> 05:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
according to our
 
05:00:17.628 --> 05:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:21.750 --> 05:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
to move towards an equitable position
 
05:00:25.628 --> 05:00:25.638 align:start position:0%
for all kids and P particularly those
 
05:00:29.190 --> 05:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
kids that are living in property poor
 
05:00:32.948 --> 05:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
school districts and who themselves come
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
from a property poor not a property an
 
05:00:39.548 --> 05:00:39.558 align:start position:0%
income poor right household right no
 
05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks very much for the uh for
 
05:00:44.030 --> 05:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
the question I'm going to try to see if
 
05:00:46.230 --> 05:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
if uh if the chair will allow me to use
 
05:00:48.510 --> 05:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
a prop I'm not sure I can find it in
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
time um but um but well so here's
 
05:00:57.948 --> 05:00:57.958 align:start position:0%
one are you are you referencing the yeah
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
I'm referencing report commission
 
05:01:00.600 --> 05:01:01.948 align:start position:0%
I'm referencing report commission
reports

05:01:01.948 --> 05:01:01.958 align:start position:0%
reports
 
05:01:05.590 --> 05:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
and yeah and so so yep yep so this is on
 
05:01:05.600 --> 05:01:07.190 align:start position:0%
and yeah and so so yep yep so this is on
page

05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:01:10.990 --> 05:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
27 where where it shows um a correlation
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
of of a minus 89 which is a very strong
 
05:01:18.670 --> 05:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
r value for for for correlation between
 
05:01:21.990 --> 05:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh loow income and outcome Factor uh
 
05:01:25.030 --> 05:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
scores so so you know how students
 
05:01:27.470 --> 05:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
perform on test what I'm really looking
 
05:01:31.030 --> 05:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
for is the there's a there's a bubble
 
05:01:33.628 --> 05:01:33.638 align:start position:0%
chart in
 
05:01:37.230 --> 05:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
here that talks about how the difference
 
05:01:39.948 --> 05:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
in a in a targeted because this this is
 
05:01:42.190 --> 05:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is is is
 
05:01:44.470 --> 05:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
targeted school funding not one size
 
05:01:49.590 --> 05:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
fits all target um um and and how how
 
05:01:52.030 --> 05:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
how you you can take a look at one size
 
05:01:55.270 --> 05:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
fits-all and see how all the bubbles are
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter how how um for every
 
05:02:00.750 --> 05:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
school district they're basically all
 
05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
lined up lined up straight but in
 
05:02:06.510 --> 05:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
targeted you can you can see that where
 
05:02:08.628 --> 05:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
the where the where the student needs
 
05:02:11.590 --> 05:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
are greater or where the access to
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
resources are less that that it it's
 
05:02:17.708 --> 05:02:17.718 align:start position:0%
it's much more um it's less regressive
 
05:02:20.350 --> 05:02:20.360 align:start position:0%
than it is um right now a lot less
 
05:02:22.868 --> 05:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
regressive and New Hampshire has one of
 
05:02:24.628 --> 05:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
I guess that's one of the other graphs
 
05:02:26.030 --> 05:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
in here I might be able to find it I
 
05:02:28.590 --> 05:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
think I just saw it on page
 
05:02:32.190 --> 05:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
25 um it Compares New Hampshire with uh
 
05:02:34.990 --> 05:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
with other states and um and it just
 
05:02:38.270 --> 05:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
basically shows a line between um uh
 
05:02:41.430 --> 05:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
relative spending and and um and uh
 
05:02:43.430 --> 05:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
relative poverty so we're you know that
 
05:02:46.390 --> 05:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
same graph U that we showed in other you
 
05:02:48.628 --> 05:02:48.638 align:start position:0%
know on page 27 that that represent
 
05:02:52.230 --> 05:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
fellow asked about and um and what um
 
05:02:56.548 --> 05:02:56.558 align:start position:0%
what 772 does is shifts that um that
 
05:02:59.628 --> 05:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
that line from a regressive line to
 
05:03:01.708 --> 05:03:01.718 align:start position:0%
something much less aggressive and much
 
05:03:04.948 --> 05:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
more Equitable and and if I can add on
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
on to this too what's what's other
 
05:03:11.110 --> 05:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
states have looked at this obviously you
 
05:03:13.670 --> 05:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
know States uh do it our neighboring
 
05:03:16.670 --> 05:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
state Vermont uh did it as well and they
 
05:03:20.270 --> 05:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
focused their attention on taxpayer
 
05:03:22.830 --> 05:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
Equity so I think everybody in Vermont
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
pays $10 per thousand on their property
 
05:03:28.070 --> 05:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
tax and so the state funds I mean it's
 
05:03:31.150 --> 05:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
something like this and and the state
 
05:03:34.390 --> 05:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
distributes those funds to fund um uh to
 
05:03:36.190 --> 05:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
fund their public uh their Public
 
05:03:38.670 --> 05:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
Schools but it doesn't base it on
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
student outcomes and doesn't
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
differentiate the fact that maybe kids
 
05:03:46.948 --> 05:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
going to Rutland are are are maybe maybe
 
05:03:48.868 --> 05:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
the challenges in Rutland are different
 
05:03:52.190 --> 05:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
than the than the than the challenges in
 
05:03:57.190 --> 05:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
um in Woodstock and um and and so what
 
05:04:00.708 --> 05:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
772 does is it focuses on the student
 
05:04:03.470 --> 05:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
outcomes first and when you focus on
 
05:04:06.190 --> 05:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
student outcomes the taxpayer Equity
 
05:04:09.390 --> 05:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
follows if it's fair for students it is
 
05:04:11.868 --> 05:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
fair for taxpayers not not necessarily
 
05:04:13.990 --> 05:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
the other way around and and I think
 
05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
this is why it's too good an opportunity
 
05:04:18.350 --> 05:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
for us we may not get to it this year
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot in here um but but if
 
05:04:22.910 --> 05:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to do something that's fair
 
05:04:25.310 --> 05:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers and I think all of our all
 
05:04:29.070 --> 05:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
of our um constituents want that then as
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
sure as heck should be fair for students
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
too um uh because we don't want to let
 
05:04:36.430 --> 05:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
you know leave them on the side of the
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
road further questions from the
 
05:04:38.878 --> 05:04:42.670 align:start position:0%
road further questions from the
committee

05:04:42.670 --> 05:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:45.030 --> 05:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:04:47.510 --> 05:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question as we're talking
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
about this we're talking about fairness
 
05:04:53.788 --> 05:04:53.798 align:start position:0%
and you had mentioned um that part is of
 
05:04:55.750 --> 05:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
this is the state should be guaranteeing
 
05:04:58.990 --> 05:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
the resources needed for um for our
 
05:05:01.788 --> 05:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
schools and for our students and
 
05:05:03.470 --> 05:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
thinking about that and listening to
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
newort saying that they can't compete
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
with salaries um you know I'm curious
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
should we o be considering the account
 
05:05:15.990 --> 05:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
um the accountability of how money is
 
05:05:19.030 --> 05:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
spent so what I mean by that is should
 
05:05:20.868 --> 05:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
we be looking at doing some of the
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
contract negotiations some of the
 
05:05:24.110 --> 05:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
supplier no
 
05:05:26.350 --> 05:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
negotiations um consolidating some of
 
05:05:29.708 --> 05:05:29.718 align:start position:0%
the saus uh purchasing more volume
 
05:05:31.750 --> 05:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
discounts uh with more volume discounts
 
05:05:34.270 --> 05:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester obviously can buy at a much
 
05:05:36.788 --> 05:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
better rate than a a smaller School
 
05:05:39.910 --> 05:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
District so if we're going to be looking
 
05:05:42.270 --> 05:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
at making sure we're providing an
 
05:05:44.390 --> 05:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
adequate education and the revenue wise
 
05:05:46.350 --> 05:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
should we also be looking at taking on
 
05:05:48.788 --> 05:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
some of those expenses leaving the towns
 
05:05:51.470 --> 05:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
to just voting on their discretionary
 
05:05:53.948 --> 05:05:53.958 align:start position:0%
expenses as was mentioned by my fellow
 
05:05:56.110 --> 05:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
rep here yeah no that's a that's a
 
05:06:00.868 --> 05:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
really good question um I I I know some
 
05:06:02.510 --> 05:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
states do actually have I think a
 
05:06:06.948 --> 05:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
uniform uh teachers contract or um uh
 
05:06:09.390 --> 05:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
pay scale pay schedule uh for teachers
 
05:06:11.750 --> 05:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
we don't in in New Hampshire I don't
 
05:06:13.270 --> 05:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
know if something like that would work
 
05:06:17.430 --> 05:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um and um and that may
 
05:06:21.788 --> 05:06:21.798 align:start position:0%
be something that uh that that you know
 
05:06:24.070 --> 05:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
we may want to we may want to look at I
 
05:06:26.070 --> 05:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
think there's a bill in that's going to
 
05:06:28.628 --> 05:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
seek to establish a commission to study
 
05:06:30.910 --> 05:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh School District consolidation or SAU
 
05:06:33.070 --> 05:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
consolidation I forget which I think
 
05:06:36.750 --> 05:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
it's been heard already saus saus and
 
05:06:38.230 --> 05:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
and that's something that I think we
 
05:06:40.150 --> 05:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
should learn about
 
05:06:41.070 --> 05:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
I you
 
05:06:44.230 --> 05:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
know teacher you know Personnel salaries
 
05:06:47.270 --> 05:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
I think are are somewhere you know 75 to
 
05:06:50.750 --> 05:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
80% of a of a school district's budget
 
05:06:53.708 --> 05:06:53.718 align:start position:0%
and and um you know purchasing materials
 
05:06:56.150 --> 05:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
and toilet paper and stuff like that you
 
05:06:58.230 --> 05:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
know I you know yeah I mean I suppose we
 
05:07:00.788 --> 05:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
could have purchase agreements and and
 
05:07:02.310 --> 05:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
and actually Hopkinson does have
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
purchase agreements with with other
 
05:07:07.190 --> 05:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
school districts for some bulk items and
 
05:07:10.110 --> 05:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
U and I think uh through the
 
05:07:13.590 --> 05:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
I think through the LGC maybe there's
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's um um uh uh fuel uh purchasing
 
05:07:22.270 --> 05:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
agreements too uh but I'd be going back
 
05:07:24.788 --> 05:07:24.798 align:start position:0%
a bunch of years on that so so I think
 
05:07:27.230 --> 05:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
some I think districts are doing that in
 
05:07:29.910 --> 05:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
hopkington and Jerry F not here Sor can
 
05:07:32.590 --> 05:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
I excuse me one second what's LGC The
 
05:07:34.150 --> 05:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
Local Government Center thank you sorry
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
keep going and um and uh you know we
 
05:07:40.390 --> 05:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
even I think partner with Hopkinson and
 
05:07:43.150 --> 05:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
karge partnered uh with uh because we
 
05:07:47.110 --> 05:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
both send kids to the to the CTC in
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
conquered for um for career technical
 
05:07:51.590 --> 05:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
education and so the bus started in
 
05:07:53.190 --> 05:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
karge and picked up the kids in
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton and then went to conquer so so
 
05:07:58.510 --> 05:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
school districts are are collaborating
 
05:08:00.750 --> 05:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to find ways saving saving
 
05:08:02.948 --> 05:08:02.958 align:start position:0%
money whether that's through CTE and
 
05:08:04.910 --> 05:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
transportation or purchasing agreements
 
05:08:07.948 --> 05:08:07.958 align:start position:0%
or sports teams um uh they do work
 
05:08:07.958 --> 05:08:09.868 align:start position:0%
or sports teams um uh they do work
together

05:08:09.868 --> 05:08:09.878 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:08:11.510 --> 05:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes we have a
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
collaborative on our bus routes up there
 
05:08:15.868 --> 05:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
in hail collaborative is with schools in
 
05:08:18.990 --> 05:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont yeah so the bus lines are going
 
05:08:21.430 --> 05:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
both sides of the river paid equally by
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
the two school districts Blue Mountain
 
05:08:25.990 --> 05:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then uh April and you got a bridge
 
05:08:29.670 --> 05:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
there too we have a bridge yeah yeah
 
05:08:31.030 --> 05:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's G to be a toll in that bridge
 
05:08:34.030 --> 05:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
pretty soon um I got a question for you
 
05:08:36.548 --> 05:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
here uh you mentioned targeting versus
 
05:08:39.110 --> 05:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
non-targeting and of course the left
 
05:08:42.350 --> 05:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
hand side of our formula right now is
 
05:08:45.750 --> 05:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
we're Bound By The Claremont London
 
05:08:49.310 --> 05:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
decisions where all districts regardless
 
05:08:52.110 --> 05:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
of their wealth or their poverty are
 
05:08:55.390 --> 05:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
treated the same uh the right hand side
 
05:08:57.948 --> 05:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
of our our our funding formulas tried to
 
05:09:00.628 --> 05:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
Target money towards certain
 
05:09:03.470 --> 05:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
groups uh this formula right
 
05:09:07.390 --> 05:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
here where is there any problems here
 
05:09:09.548 --> 05:09:09.558 align:start position:0%
that we may encounter with the clar
 
05:09:11.948 --> 05:09:11.958 align:start position:0%
decisions regard to how we're now we're
 
05:09:15.310 --> 05:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
targeting money towards specific
 
05:09:18.590 --> 05:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
students so so thanks for that question
 
05:09:22.708 --> 05:09:22.718 align:start position:0%
um uh just for the to to to uh to be
 
05:09:25.788 --> 05:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
completely clear um uh representative
 
05:09:29.470 --> 05:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
Ames um um former representative Mel
 
05:09:35.390 --> 05:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
Miler Mary Heath and I uh are are filed
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
in a Mei brief with the court to present
 
05:09:39.948 --> 05:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
that very
 
05:09:44.350 --> 05:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
question and and uh and you know maybe
 
05:09:47.110 --> 05:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative Ames um well I mean I
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
think this this is good work session
 
05:09:57.708 --> 05:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
discussion too um but but I believe the
 
05:10:01.310 --> 05:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
the the words in our Constitution use
 
05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
the word guarantee
 
05:10:06.110 --> 05:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
funding am I correct on
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
that I mean I'm sorry I'm not trying to
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
turn this into well I know that we had
 
05:10:14.350 --> 05:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
this discussion with hardinger and uh
 
05:10:16.948 --> 05:10:16.958 align:start position:0%
and we looked at the models down in
 
05:10:19.030 --> 05:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and there there's a
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
difference and we of course have these
 
05:10:21.670 --> 05:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
court cases which are kind of
 
05:10:23.350 --> 05:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
controlling what we have
 
05:10:27.190 --> 05:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
done right right so so you know so I I
 
05:10:29.150 --> 05:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
think you're right I mean I think I
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
think this this committee is going to be
 
05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
very and I think the legislature is
 
05:10:36.270 --> 05:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
going to be very interested in in what
 
05:10:38.750 --> 05:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
um what the court comes back with on
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
particularly on conval but also on on
 
05:10:43.230 --> 05:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
Rand and as you and I were talking about
 
05:10:47.150 --> 05:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
it the other day too I I I I don't feel
 
05:10:50.110 --> 05:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
that we should be reading too
 
05:10:52.190 --> 05:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
prescriptively that that the court is
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
telling us what to do perhaps the court
 
05:10:57.390 --> 05:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
is telling us what to do if the model
 
05:10:59.190 --> 05:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't change if we're going to just be
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
doing the same one siiz fits-all um type
 
05:11:05.470 --> 05:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
of way of funding um funding our schools
 
05:11:07.310 --> 05:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
but if we're interested in looking at
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
something different I would hope been
 
05:11:12.350 --> 05:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
far for me to tell tell a judge what to
 
05:11:17.990 --> 05:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
do um but um um you get the joke right
 
05:11:20.350 --> 05:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
hey don't you live with a judge yeah
 
05:11:25.430 --> 05:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
there you go yeah so um but um but but
 
05:11:27.628 --> 05:11:27.638 align:start position:0%
that that that maybe there would be and
 
05:11:30.070 --> 05:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
this is the point of our of our amichi
 
05:11:33.788 --> 05:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
brief that that that other models exist
 
05:11:36.788 --> 05:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
that that that would depart from a
 
05:11:39.990 --> 05:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
uniform one-size fits-all payoff
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
type of um type of um uh funding
 
05:11:46.548 --> 05:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
mechanism and could do a much better job
 
05:11:48.548 --> 05:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
for both New Hampshire students as well
 
05:11:48.558 --> 05:11:49.670 align:start position:0%
for both New Hampshire students as well
as

05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers further questions represent
 
05:11:55.548 --> 05:11:55.558 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you um I just I'm looking
 
05:11:57.430 --> 05:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
at that second block you know where
 
05:11:59.670 --> 05:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
where it has the requirements that from
 
05:12:02.708 --> 05:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
the conval case and the last thing that
 
05:12:06.628 --> 05:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
the state's responsible for is um
 
05:12:08.510 --> 05:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
accountability to make sure that
 
05:12:12.270 --> 05:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
districts have have provided an adequate
 
05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
education and districts are doing that
 
05:12:18.070 --> 05:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
based on the District budget so you have
 
05:12:21.190 --> 05:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
to remember that I come from towns that
 
05:12:25.270 --> 05:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
have a Cooperative School District so
 
05:12:25.280 --> 05:12:25.990 align:start position:0%
have a Cooperative School District so
the

05:12:25.990 --> 05:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:27.948 --> 05:12:27.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities are
 
05:12:27.958 --> 05:12:29.628 align:start position:0%
municipalities are
not

05:12:29.628 --> 05:12:29.638 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:12:29.638 --> 05:12:31.548 align:start position:0%
not
responsible

05:12:31.548 --> 05:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
05:12:35.150 --> 05:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
for only the dist the um towns in a
 
05:12:38.350 --> 05:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
co-op are only collectively responsible
 
05:12:40.830 --> 05:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
for what they vote on for the District
 
05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
budget so where how do
 
05:12:44.480 --> 05:12:46.150 align:start position:0%
budget so where how do
you

05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:12:46.160 --> 05:12:48.030 align:start position:0%
you
reconcile

05:12:48.030 --> 05:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
reconcile
 
05:12:51.510 --> 05:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
calculations for a municipality with
 
05:12:53.788 --> 05:12:53.798 align:start position:0%
districts yeah no thanks very much for
 
05:12:55.390 --> 05:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
the question because that that's a
 
05:12:58.390 --> 05:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's a really great great question um
 
05:13:01.590 --> 05:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
currently accountability can also you
 
05:13:03.708 --> 05:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
know and it's and it's accountability to
 
05:13:06.390 --> 05:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
the to the state share that that comes
 
05:13:09.350 --> 05:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
through through the adequacy grant um
 
05:13:11.390 --> 05:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
that that as long as states are
 
05:13:13.788 --> 05:13:13.798 align:start position:0%
operating within the parameters that are
 
05:13:17.548 --> 05:13:17.558 align:start position:0%
defined in in statute or in rules that
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
that class size is below this number
 
05:13:21.910 --> 05:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
that you've got one 1500th of a
 
05:13:24.510 --> 05:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
principal for every student one 1500th
 
05:13:29.628 --> 05:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
of a um of a u um uh of a uh school
 
05:13:32.070 --> 05:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
counselor for every student I mean
 
05:13:34.990 --> 05:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
that's accountability that that the what
 
05:13:37.230 --> 05:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
what we add here is student performance
 
05:13:39.510 --> 05:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
is student outcomes and the fact that
 
05:13:41.708 --> 05:13:41.718 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity budgets are
 
05:13:45.510 --> 05:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
calculated based on based on the the the
 
05:13:47.310 --> 05:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
the all the based on a district
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
educating all of its students to a
 
05:13:53.230 --> 05:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
Statewide outcome that uh that districts
 
05:13:55.510 --> 05:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
can be held accountability can be held
 
05:13:58.670 --> 05:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
accountable to that average and um and
 
05:14:00.590 --> 05:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
yes there's there so there there's a
 
05:14:03.070 --> 05:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
shift in how how the accountability
 
05:14:06.150 --> 05:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
language in I'm not remembering all the
 
05:14:09.350 --> 05:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
sections 198 H something like that
 
05:14:11.868 --> 05:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
something like that um talks about
 
05:14:14.830 --> 05:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
accountability and and that um and you
 
05:14:17.390 --> 05:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
know we don't we you know I don't think
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
it talks about shutting down the school
 
05:14:21.990 --> 05:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
but if if if a school district after a
 
05:14:24.548 --> 05:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
certain number of years is not seeing
 
05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
their their their average student
 
05:14:29.990 --> 05:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
performing towards the Statewide average
 
05:14:31.830 --> 05:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education would
 
05:14:35.470 --> 05:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:39.948 --> 05:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
guidance pardon me yes so I'm thinking
 
05:14:42.430 --> 05:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
if you have two two school districts and
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
number of kids in them are exactly the
 
05:14:47.270 --> 05:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
same but one of them the students are
 
05:14:48.990 --> 05:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
performing lower
 
05:14:51.708 --> 05:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
because we won't go into why they're
 
05:14:53.310 --> 05:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
they're performing well let's say
 
05:14:57.190 --> 05:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
because um the income level in in the
 
05:14:59.670 --> 05:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
town is lower than in the in the other
 
05:15:03.430 --> 05:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
Town wouldn't that opportunity budget
 
05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
for those two dist districts be
 
05:15:08.390 --> 05:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
different they are okay they are the one
 
05:15:13.070 --> 05:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
the one that if more resources yes so so
 
05:15:15.510 --> 05:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes if you had two identical
 
05:15:18.788 --> 05:15:18.798 align:start position:0%
districts um identical in every way
 
05:15:22.430 --> 05:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
except uh District you know District B
 
05:15:25.470 --> 05:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
has or you know one of the districts has
 
05:15:28.590 --> 05:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh has a substantially higher you know
 
05:15:29.910 --> 05:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
number of students that come from
 
05:15:32.110 --> 05:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
low-income backgrounds that District
 
05:15:33.670 --> 05:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
would have a higher Foundation
 
05:15:36.948 --> 05:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget than the other one
 
05:15:39.948 --> 05:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
yes other questions
 
05:15:42.628 --> 05:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
yes I I'm intrigued by this whole thing
 
05:15:45.190 --> 05:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
because I when we talk about wind them
 
05:15:48.390 --> 05:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
um and let's look at Penbrook if say for
 
05:15:50.788 --> 05:15:50.798 align:start position:0%
instance wiam is performing and and they
 
05:15:53.190 --> 05:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
have a marching band they have things in
 
05:15:55.030 --> 05:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
their program that they can actually be
 
05:15:58.150 --> 05:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
for can we look at this and say penberg
 
05:15:59.708 --> 05:15:59.718 align:start position:0%
needs a marching band as well so that
 
05:16:02.430 --> 05:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
there there becomes equality of of what
 
05:16:04.910 --> 05:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
districts are offering and especially in
 
05:16:06.670 --> 05:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
terms of the amount of money that's
 
05:16:08.470 --> 05:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
being offered faculty because there's a
 
05:16:12.708 --> 05:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
huge sure sure um yeah I you you you can
 
05:16:14.590 --> 05:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
count on that there there are some
 
05:16:18.628 --> 05:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
things that some um and we've got a
 
05:16:20.788 --> 05:16:20.798 align:start position:0%
whole we've got a whole discussion brief
 
05:16:23.070 --> 05:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
on the school funding website on talking
 
05:16:26.830 --> 05:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
about um um some costs that that that
 
05:16:29.750 --> 05:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the same type of efficiency
 
05:16:32.590 --> 05:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
um to them and there are some there are
 
05:16:37.310 --> 05:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
some um but um but a lot of things like
 
05:16:39.990 --> 05:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's a school ban or a football
 
05:16:44.310 --> 05:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
team or or you know a spirit team or
 
05:16:46.470 --> 05:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
something like that I mean or or a first
 
05:16:49.310 --> 05:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
robotics team I mean you know these are
 
05:16:51.230 --> 05:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
all these are all part of the reasons
 
05:16:53.150 --> 05:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
why why kids show up to school in the
 
05:16:55.270 --> 05:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
morning right because they sign up they
 
05:16:57.310 --> 05:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
signed the co-curricular agreement
 
05:16:58.750 --> 05:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
saying you know what if you don't come
 
05:17:00.470 --> 05:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
to school that day you don't come to
 
05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
practice you don't come to practice you
 
05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't play right yeah yeah and so it
 
05:17:07.628 --> 05:17:07.638 align:start position:0%
gets the school it gets the kids in the
 
05:17:10.670 --> 05:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
door and and that's a big I'm not I
 
05:17:12.510 --> 05:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a a teacher background I
 
05:17:14.470 --> 05:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
think there's there's a lot folks in
 
05:17:16.868 --> 05:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
here that do but that's a big part of
 
05:17:20.270 --> 05:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
the battle right getting the kids in the
 
05:17:25.750 --> 05:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:29.750 --> 05:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
something yeah in terms of this bill um
 
05:17:32.590 --> 05:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
how how are the how are the marching
 
05:17:34.948 --> 05:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
band schools and the the theater program
 
05:17:37.430 --> 05:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
schools how are they differentiated in
 
05:17:39.150 --> 05:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
in any way in what's being funded that's
 
05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
all that's all part of the
 
05:17:43.948 --> 05:17:43.958 align:start position:0%
calculation you know if if wendam has
 
05:17:47.830 --> 05:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
them and and Pa doesn't then then then
 
05:17:50.190 --> 05:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
then and and and windom's student
 
05:17:53.030 --> 05:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes are higher than Pas there'll
 
05:17:54.830 --> 05:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
there'll be things that are attributed
 
05:17:56.750 --> 05:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
student outcomes will be attributed to
 
05:17:59.110 --> 05:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that it offers those programs
 
05:18:01.990 --> 05:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
PA's budget Foundation opportunity
 
05:18:06.430 --> 05:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
budget would include programs necessary
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
to bring those students up but it would
 
05:18:13.190 --> 05:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
really be to the the um the um the the
 
05:18:16.510 --> 05:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
professional guidance of your building
 
05:18:19.868 --> 05:18:19.878 align:start position:0%
principles your superintendent and your
 
05:18:22.910 --> 05:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
teachers um with which to know what sort
 
05:18:25.070 --> 05:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
of programs to and I keep looking over
 
05:18:27.030 --> 05:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
at Tracy because she's on a school board
 
05:18:30.430 --> 05:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
and as a teacher um you know to make a
 
05:18:33.270 --> 05:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
to make a professional determination um
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
as as to what to what to offer and and
 
05:18:37.628 --> 05:18:37.638 align:start position:0%
like I mentioned in the accountability
 
05:18:39.110 --> 05:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
section if you're not getting the
 
05:18:40.948 --> 05:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
results after a certain number of years
 
05:18:42.270 --> 05:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
the department will give you some
 
05:18:45.628 --> 05:18:45.638 align:start position:0%
guidance on um on on you know maybe you
 
05:18:48.110 --> 05:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
know take a look at what Windam is doing
 
05:18:50.590 --> 05:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
and um do a little bit more of
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
that further questions from the
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much great
 
05:19:02.110 --> 05:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:02.120 --> 05:19:03.628 align:start position:0%
 
chair

05:19:03.628 --> 05:19:03.638 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
me yeah um that that came from Dr and Dr
 
05:19:11.750 --> 05:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
sitting right to your right
 
05:19:16.030 --> 05:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
Bruce um Bruce do you have a moment to I
 
05:19:17.670 --> 05:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
I I noticed within that report there's
 
05:19:20.868 --> 05:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
some issues dealing with the swep and in
 
05:19:23.390 --> 05:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
forms and all that can you talk about
 
05:19:26.590 --> 05:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
that a little bit what you you indicated
 
05:19:28.910 --> 05:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
if the local is going to collect come on
 
05:19:31.430 --> 05:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
up so I don't have to go across the room
 
05:19:31.440 --> 05:19:35.910 align:start position:0%
up so I don't have to go across the room
and

05:19:35.910 --> 05:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:38.470 --> 05:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
talk as technical support I was going to
 
05:19:42.868 --> 05:19:42.878 align:start position:0%
ask for this um the local municipality
 
05:19:45.230 --> 05:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
collects the
 
05:19:49.350 --> 05:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
swep the swep is then returned or sent
 
05:19:52.350 --> 05:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:52.360 --> 05:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
state

05:19:54.070 --> 05:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:19:56.628 --> 05:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
the in this
 
05:19:59.628 --> 05:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
bill everything is sent to the treasury
 
05:20:01.948 --> 05:20:01.958 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I'm saying to the
 
05:20:04.110 --> 05:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
treasury yeah in this
 
05:20:07.948 --> 05:20:07.958 align:start position:0%
bill and within that we used to have
 
05:20:10.190 --> 05:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
various form forms which were created by
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
at that time I don't know if was Dr or
 
05:20:15.230 --> 05:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Ed for the process
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
for funneling this stuff back to the
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
treasur um and have you addressed that
 
05:20:25.510 --> 05:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
at all in this report that you have here
 
05:20:27.628 --> 05:20:27.638 align:start position:0%
you gave
 
05:20:31.110 --> 05:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
us very briefly it was addressed I mean
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:54.270 --> 05:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe the uh the quick guide
 
05:20:59.310 --> 05:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
note was meant to um state that
 
05:21:02.430 --> 05:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
examining some very old records gives us
 
05:21:06.110 --> 05:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
an idea of how that would be
 
05:21:09.230 --> 05:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
accomplished um forms
 
05:21:13.030 --> 05:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
really stopped being used for that
 
05:21:16.830 --> 05:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
purpose I believe around 2003 might have
 
05:21:19.628 --> 05:21:19.638 align:start position:0%
been the last year so we have a few
 
05:21:23.230 --> 05:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
archived examples of how it took place
 
05:21:26.110 --> 05:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
then what this bill is describing looks
 
05:21:30.310 --> 05:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
to be similar to that in terms of uh the
 
05:21:33.868 --> 05:21:33.878 align:start position:0%
relationship between swept taxes being
 
05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
raised and then uh sent to the state
 
05:21:41.590 --> 05:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
so um I hope that can address that's
 
05:21:43.788 --> 05:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
about all I can say at this point
 
05:21:46.548 --> 05:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
because um it hasn't been something
 
05:21:48.990 --> 05:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
that's been used for a very very long
 
05:21:52.390 --> 05:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
time but it doesn't look I I I I've seen
 
05:21:54.430 --> 05:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
it back in those years but I thought it
 
05:21:57.270 --> 05:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
came up closer like to 2011 or
 
05:22:00.910 --> 05:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
so uh when when the districts were
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to municipalities allowed to
 
05:22:06.628 --> 05:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
keep the excess rather than having to
 
05:22:08.990 --> 05:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
return it back and have have to do some
 
05:22:09.000 --> 05:22:09.910 align:start position:0%
return it back and have have to do some
more

05:22:09.910 --> 05:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:22:11.430 --> 05:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
research you don't have to go
 
05:22:13.350 --> 05:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
researching that are there any other
 
05:22:14.910 --> 05:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
technical questions for yes
 
05:22:17.510 --> 05:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative Earth I hope this is an
 
05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
easy one is this note and your others
 
05:22:19.280 --> 05:22:20.510 align:start position:0%
easy one is this note and your others
available

05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:22:24.350 --> 05:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
online um attorney Ramsey indicated to
 
05:22:27.510 --> 05:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
me when I was back at Dr that they were
 
05:22:29.788 --> 05:22:29.798 align:start position:0%
hoping to have the quick guides up on
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
the website this afternoon okay can you
 
05:22:33.990 --> 05:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
let us know where that
 
05:22:36.548 --> 05:22:36.558 align:start position:0%
is where we're on the website yeah we're
 
05:22:39.628 --> 05:22:39.638 align:start position:0%
on the website soon as I learned that I
 
05:22:41.350 --> 05:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
could uh I don't
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
know okay I mean it be very helpful to
 
05:22:45.190 --> 05:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
actually maybe have even tied into the
 
05:22:47.350 --> 05:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
bill as it reports out of the legisl so
 
05:22:49.830 --> 05:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
we had links to it from here from the
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
from the legislative website all right I
 
05:22:54.350 --> 05:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
will let her know that uh there is that
 
05:22:56.590 --> 05:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
desire Jennifer is that something we
 
05:22:59.590 --> 05:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
could do is have you know a link design
 
05:23:01.470 --> 05:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
SC she's our researcher and our attorney
 
05:23:04.190 --> 05:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
that works with is is the possible to
 
05:23:05.670 --> 05:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
link through that and we could link
 
05:23:07.350 --> 05:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
right in that way when we go look at
 
05:23:10.548 --> 05:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:12.990 --> 05:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
I think the closest that we could come
 
05:23:21.150 --> 05:23:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:23.910 --> 05:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
testimony yeah I think we could also
 
05:23:27.628 --> 05:23:27.638 align:start position:0%
work through the LBA they have a website
 
05:23:30.910 --> 05:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:30.920 --> 05:23:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
were

05:23:33.110 --> 05:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:23:37.070 --> 05:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
okay yes represent fellows yes um can
 
05:23:39.070 --> 05:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
you just you you know I haven't had a
 
05:23:41.390 --> 05:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
chance to read what you handed out can
 
05:23:43.868 --> 05:23:43.878 align:start position:0%
you just um tell us
 
05:23:47.670 --> 05:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
briefly um about the equalization
 
05:23:49.750 --> 05:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
process and how that's
 
05:23:53.310 --> 05:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
impacting the irregularities of in the
 
05:23:56.110 --> 05:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
state property tax rates there there was
 
05:23:59.390 --> 05:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
an article in the um union leader not
 
05:24:02.190 --> 05:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
this Sunday but the one before about how
 
05:24:04.390 --> 05:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
it's impacting towns because it's only
 
05:24:08.548 --> 05:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
done every five years can you talk just
 
05:24:10.310 --> 05:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
a little
 
05:24:13.708 --> 05:24:13.718 align:start position:0%
bit actually representative fellows very
 
05:24:16.030 --> 05:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
little because it's not an area of
 
05:24:19.270 --> 05:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
specialty for me um I think you'd
 
05:24:20.670 --> 05:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
probably the committee probably need to
 
05:24:22.270 --> 05:24:22.280 align:start position:0%
hear from someone like assistant
 
05:24:25.230 --> 05:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
director danan core to speak to the
 
05:24:27.110 --> 05:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
intricacies of
 
05:24:29.670 --> 05:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
Equalization and what you're describing
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid I just don't participate in
 
05:24:33.910 --> 05:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
that aspect of the
 
05:24:38.750 --> 05:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:40.070 --> 05:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
good to see you
 
05:24:42.628 --> 05:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
again sir and this
 
05:24:46.750 --> 05:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
is just to note well first I very much
 
05:24:49.150 --> 05:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate the hard work that you and or
 
05:24:53.390 --> 05:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
your staff did in trying to get your
 
05:24:56.350 --> 05:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
head around the various confusing
 
05:25:00.270 --> 05:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
aspects of this bill um very much
 
05:25:03.750 --> 05:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and um having been
 
05:25:07.510 --> 05:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
confused by many dimensions of it over
 
05:25:10.788 --> 05:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
many years um I can
 
05:25:14.150 --> 05:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh sympathize empathize with that effort
 
05:25:18.430 --> 05:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh I know that in this note I
 
05:25:21.390 --> 05:25:21.400 align:start position:0%
read it very quickly first thing this
 
05:25:23.868 --> 05:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
morning I think
 
05:25:28.708 --> 05:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
um you identified Dr identified
 
05:25:33.548 --> 05:25:33.558 align:start position:0%
some some apparent uh circular
 
05:25:37.708 --> 05:25:37.718 align:start position:0%
secularity of uh relationships between
 
05:25:41.150 --> 05:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh Concepts and so forth um and all I
 
05:25:45.548 --> 05:25:45.558 align:start position:0%
want to say right now is thank you and
 
05:25:47.990 --> 05:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
we'll work on it and see
 
05:25:51.070 --> 05:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
if we agree that there's stuff there
 
05:25:53.310 --> 05:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
that needs to be fixed and we'll fix it
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
and I when I say we i' been working
 
05:25:59.150 --> 05:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
closely with representative luno and and
 
05:26:03.948 --> 05:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
Bill ardinger outside of these Halls um
 
05:26:07.868 --> 05:26:07.878 align:start position:0%
we we'll get it right and it's it's just
 
05:26:10.990 --> 05:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
techn stuff ultimately just needs to get
 
05:26:14.030 --> 05:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
the concepts are right just need to get
 
05:26:16.750 --> 05:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh make sure it's right in the eyes of
 
05:26:19.350 --> 05:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
those that have to manage it which is
 
05:26:19.360 --> 05:26:20.030 align:start position:0%
those that have to manage it which is
the

05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:26:22.310 --> 05:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
Dr representative Ames the most
 
05:26:24.430 --> 05:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
important thing from my perspective
 
05:26:27.948 --> 05:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
about the bill is really laying out a
 
05:26:31.788 --> 05:26:31.798 align:start position:0%
timeline to see when which
 
05:26:35.470 --> 05:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
agency or entity is expected to do
 
05:26:37.708 --> 05:26:37.718 align:start position:0%
something and then contrast that with
 
05:26:39.910 --> 05:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
the timeline line that you know is is
 
05:26:42.270 --> 05:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
well established and that's where that
 
05:26:45.230 --> 05:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
question of and I can say for a fact I
 
05:26:46.910 --> 05:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
mean at
 
05:26:49.910 --> 05:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
currently our entire annual process of
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
setting a property tax rate drives
 
05:26:55.670 --> 05:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
toward toward One Moment In Time when
 
05:26:58.110 --> 05:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
the rates are established and there's
 
05:27:02.030 --> 05:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
nothing in that set of calculations that
 
05:27:05.948 --> 05:27:05.958 align:start position:0%
in envisioned any kind of
 
05:27:08.868 --> 05:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
comparison that's the circularity of
 
05:27:12.750 --> 05:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
establish a rate compare it possibly
 
05:27:16.948 --> 05:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
have to adjust it before finalizing
 
05:27:22.310 --> 05:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
it um but a timeline begins to help us
 
05:27:26.830 --> 05:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
understand if we can accommodate that or
 
05:27:31.070 --> 05:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
if deadlines have to be requested to be
 
05:27:35.628 --> 05:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
changed um and I look forward again to
 
05:27:38.628 --> 05:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
working with uh everybody knows mark at
 
05:27:40.990 --> 05:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
education as we sort of sit down and
 
05:27:43.350 --> 05:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
combine our timelines and make certain
 
05:27:45.628 --> 05:27:45.638 align:start position:0%
that what he needs or education needs we
 
05:27:48.628 --> 05:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
can supply in a timely fashion and vice
 
05:27:54.708 --> 05:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:58.190 --> 05:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
again um any further questions by what
 
05:28:00.830 --> 05:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
index or how you're there
 
05:28:03.868 --> 05:28:03.878 align:start position:0%
363 million for the
 
05:28:07.390 --> 05:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
swep do we've had it constant we haven't
 
05:28:10.868 --> 05:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
changed that we haven't gone with CPI or
 
05:28:13.910 --> 05:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
whatever no how would that be done and
 
05:28:16.270 --> 05:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
this bill it's it's not going to remain
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
constant at 363 I would assume it's
 
05:28:19.830 --> 05:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
going to have to
 
05:28:23.430 --> 05:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
grow the the the calculations we could
 
05:28:26.150 --> 05:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
call this a Back to the Future moment uh
 
05:28:28.310 --> 05:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll it will be something like it
 
05:28:31.750 --> 05:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
was in 1999 and the succeeding I think
 
05:28:35.430 --> 05:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
three or four years there's a rate we'll
 
05:28:37.230 --> 05:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
get the equalized values from the
 
05:28:41.070 --> 05:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
equalization Z compile them we have a
 
05:28:45.990 --> 05:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
total we'll apply that uh 250 per th000
 
05:28:49.350 --> 05:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
rate we'll extend that and develop a
 
05:28:51.670 --> 05:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
dollar amount for every
 
05:28:54.310 --> 05:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
municipality and that will become the
 
05:28:55.670 --> 05:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
the swept
 
05:28:59.430 --> 05:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
warrant um and which is exactly what I I
 
05:29:01.670 --> 05:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't there but I'm I'm pretty certain
 
05:29:04.350 --> 05:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
that's what was done those first few
 
05:29:07.030 --> 05:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
years although the legislature
 
05:29:12.628 --> 05:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
was matting down the rate Year bye in
 
05:29:14.548 --> 05:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
those first five
 
05:29:17.910 --> 05:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
years but in regard to the 363 that's
 
05:29:21.670 --> 05:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
been a constant number 2005 for a long
 
05:29:24.910 --> 05:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
time 2005 is is the first year it was in
 
05:29:27.548 --> 05:29:27.558 align:start position:0%
place it'll always be slightly higher
 
05:29:32.150 --> 05:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
than 363 million um by law we get to use
 
05:29:34.510 --> 05:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
a half penny on that rate which is why
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
it looks so strange the Statewide rate
 
05:29:39.548 --> 05:29:39.558 align:start position:0%
uh just to make sure it's not a
 
05:29:42.628 --> 05:29:42.638 align:start position:0%
complicated set of iterations I just I
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
literally do it myself it just takes one
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
or two tries till we have the half penny
 
05:29:51.310 --> 05:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
that gets it over the $363 million mark
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions of the
 
05:29:58.230 --> 05:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
department yes represent fellow it's not
 
05:30:00.788 --> 05:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
a question but I just wanted to um thank
 
05:30:05.310 --> 05:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
Bruce for identifying that 2003 was the
 
05:30:08.230 --> 05:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
last time that we actually sent property
 
05:30:10.788 --> 05:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
tax the swept money back to the state
 
05:30:14.510 --> 05:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
because I had asked uh Dr last year and
 
05:30:17.150 --> 05:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
the only thing they and and somebody did
 
05:30:18.830 --> 05:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of research the only thing he
 
05:30:20.708 --> 05:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
could say was that it was sometime
 
05:30:24.510 --> 05:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
before 2005 and I can confirm that there
 
05:30:27.390 --> 05:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
was nothing since 2005 because I was
 
05:30:29.430 --> 05:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
involved with that the whole time and
 
05:30:30.750 --> 05:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
you can go to the Department of
 
05:30:33.910 --> 05:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
education's website and look at adequacy
 
05:30:37.548 --> 05:30:37.558 align:start position:0%
Aid descriptions way back to 2004 and
 
05:30:39.670 --> 05:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
see that there was no mention of the
 
05:30:43.350 --> 05:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
swep going to the state further
 
05:30:46.590 --> 05:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
questions of the department thank you
 
05:30:48.788 --> 05:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
very very much I have a card here from
 
05:30:48.798 --> 05:31:01.190 align:start position:0%
very very much I have a card here from
Deborah

05:31:01.190 --> 05:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:03.510 --> 05:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
house good afternoon chairman lad it's
 
05:31:04.708 --> 05:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
good to be here with the education
 
05:31:07.590 --> 05:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
funding committee and uh I will be brief
 
05:31:09.150 --> 05:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
because I do not have a whole lot of
 
05:31:12.150 --> 05:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
Statistics to give you today um my name
 
05:31:13.670 --> 05:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
is Deborah H I am president of the
 
05:31:15.310 --> 05:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
American Federation of teachers New
 
05:31:18.590 --> 05:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here on behalf of our 3500
 
05:31:20.868 --> 05:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
members who are mostly in prek through
 
05:31:24.310 --> 05:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
12 public education as well as as uh
 
05:31:27.948 --> 05:31:27.958 align:start position:0%
higher education to support the uh big
 
05:31:31.030 --> 05:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
idea behind this bill we know that we
 
05:31:33.510 --> 05:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
need a stable
 
05:31:36.628 --> 05:31:36.638 align:start position:0%
predictable um and effective way to fund
 
05:31:38.830 --> 05:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools it is a
 
05:31:40.430 --> 05:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional right for all of our
 
05:31:42.510 --> 05:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
grand State children to have a robust
 
05:31:45.110 --> 05:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
public education and the system we have
 
05:31:47.948 --> 05:31:47.958 align:start position:0%
right now just is not managing to do
 
05:31:49.910 --> 05:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
that in a way that is fair to all of our
 
05:31:51.990 --> 05:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
students and fair to our local property
 
05:31:53.990 --> 05:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers I think we're increasingly
 
05:31:56.510 --> 05:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
seeing that um if you're not seeing it
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
now you will um come toown meeting time
 
05:32:02.030 --> 05:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
or come toown meeting time next year uh
 
05:32:03.990 --> 05:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's been a squeeze everywhere
 
05:32:05.390 --> 05:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
but we want to be fair both to the
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
students and to the property taxpayers
 
05:32:10.310 --> 05:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
um our students deserve to have small
 
05:32:12.350 --> 05:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
class sizes they deserve to have
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
professional certified and well-trained
 
05:32:17.390 --> 05:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
teachers who are capable of
 
05:32:19.590 --> 05:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
differentiating lessons for students
 
05:32:22.590 --> 05:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
with um specialized education needs as
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
well as um for students with English
 
05:32:27.390 --> 05:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
language learning needs um they deserve
 
05:32:30.350 --> 05:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
support from par Educators they deserve
 
05:32:33.590 --> 05:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
a full range of academic subjects and
 
05:32:36.750 --> 05:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
challenging curriculum so you it would
 
05:32:38.548 --> 05:32:38.558 align:start position:0%
be great to have parching B and but also
 
05:32:41.110 --> 05:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
would be really great to have uh
 
05:32:44.110 --> 05:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
calculus taught by a live instructor
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
instructor who can maybe differentiate a
 
05:32:50.670 --> 05:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
lesson if you are one of those um double
 
05:32:54.190 --> 05:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
doubly exceptional students who has both
 
05:32:56.510 --> 05:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
um you know bright intellect but a
 
05:32:59.390 --> 05:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
learning disability so all of our
 
05:33:02.310 --> 05:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
students deserve that and this is a
 
05:33:03.708 --> 05:33:03.718 align:start position:0%
different way of looking at funding it
 
05:33:07.070 --> 05:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
which is why we're excited about it um
 
05:33:08.510 --> 05:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
particularly part where it calculates
 
05:33:11.230 --> 05:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity on the actual
 
05:33:15.788 --> 05:33:15.798 align:start position:0%
cost of achieving um you know that go
 
05:33:17.948 --> 05:33:17.958 align:start position:0%
into running the school and achieving
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
the student outcomes because we know
 
05:33:23.910 --> 05:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
that performance on our assessment
 
05:33:26.510 --> 05:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
measures measures which are Statewide
 
05:33:29.750 --> 05:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
assessments vary greatly and that mostly
 
05:33:32.350 --> 05:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
correlates with whether your school is
 
05:33:34.548 --> 05:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
well funded and that correlates whether
 
05:33:36.510 --> 05:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
you're a property poor or property Rich
 
05:33:38.110 --> 05:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
District you'll always have some
 
05:33:40.510 --> 05:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
students who do well in any school we've
 
05:33:42.670 --> 05:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
always got some high performers but the
 
05:33:44.708 --> 05:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
ones who struggle are the ones who are
 
05:33:46.830 --> 05:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
in classes that don't get a lot of
 
05:33:48.750 --> 05:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
attention because they're overcrowded
 
05:33:50.150 --> 05:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
who don't necessarily come in with the
 
05:33:52.590 --> 05:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
best foundation because maybe they come
 
05:33:54.350 --> 05:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
from families where Mom and Dad are both
 
05:33:57.070 --> 05:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
working there's not someone at home uh
 
05:33:59.030 --> 05:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
who can pay a lot of attention to them
 
05:34:00.390 --> 05:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
all the time and provide them with
 
05:34:00.400 --> 05:34:01.628 align:start position:0%
all the time and provide them with
enriching

05:34:01.628 --> 05:34:01.638 align:start position:0%
enriching
 
05:34:04.430 --> 05:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
activities um if you're not coming in
 
05:34:06.628 --> 05:34:06.638 align:start position:0%
with a lot of background or have a lot
 
05:34:09.230 --> 05:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
of enriching activity outside of school
 
05:34:11.628 --> 05:34:11.638 align:start position:0%
you're coming in with a deficit and if
 
05:34:13.070 --> 05:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have a lot of individual
 
05:34:15.548 --> 05:34:15.558 align:start position:0%
attention in school the deficit just
 
05:34:18.788 --> 05:34:18.798 align:start position:0%
grows larger and larger this gives
 
05:34:21.910 --> 05:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for schools
 
05:34:26.350 --> 05:34:26.360 align:start position:0%
to provide the support that Learners
 
05:34:29.868 --> 05:34:29.878 align:start position:0%
need without breaking the back of local
 
05:34:31.390 --> 05:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers who are already
 
05:34:33.510 --> 05:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
overburdened so that's why we're excited
 
05:34:37.270 --> 05:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
about it uh as far as the nape scores go
 
05:34:40.350 --> 05:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
our gorgia New Hampshire are not
 
05:34:42.230 --> 05:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily as high as we wanted to be
 
05:34:43.548 --> 05:34:43.558 align:start position:0%
but they
 
05:34:47.430 --> 05:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
are better they are better than much of
 
05:34:52.110 --> 05:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:54.548 --> 05:34:54.558 align:start position:0%
um they are showing Improvement they're
 
05:34:56.230 --> 05:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
moving in the right direction so we are
 
05:34:58.670 --> 05:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
on the right track we are not showing
 
05:35:00.708 --> 05:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
equal Improvement in all districts which
 
05:35:02.708 --> 05:35:02.718 align:start position:0%
is why is important to get get this
 
05:35:05.430 --> 05:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
right and one other thing I I would like
 
05:35:08.190 --> 05:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
to um share with you
 
05:35:11.788 --> 05:35:11.798 align:start position:0%
is a very recent just came out yesterday
 
05:35:15.670 --> 05:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
review of uh scholar research that does
 
05:35:18.270 --> 05:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
indeed show once again that funding
 
05:35:23.070 --> 05:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
matters in K12 education increasing K12
 
05:35:25.910 --> 05:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
funding improves student outcomes and
 
05:35:28.110 --> 05:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
funding cuts hurt those outcomes this
 
05:35:30.310 --> 05:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
was an overview of scholarly research
 
05:35:32.708 --> 05:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
done by the Albert Shanker Institute and
 
05:35:35.670 --> 05:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
I will send you a link to the report um
 
05:35:38.350 --> 05:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire overall if we just look at
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
an average does well but that's because
 
05:35:43.430 --> 05:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
our local property taxpayers carry so
 
05:35:45.628 --> 05:35:45.638 align:start position:0%
much of the burden and that is
 
05:35:48.270 --> 05:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
unsustainable the opportunity to fix it
 
05:35:51.430 --> 05:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
with something like this blueprint is
 
05:35:52.750 --> 05:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
really something all of our students
 
05:35:55.150 --> 05:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
deserve and I hope that you find a way
 
05:35:57.110 --> 05:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
to make it work and pass this thank you
 
05:35:59.230 --> 05:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
very much I appreciate your thank you
 
05:36:01.708 --> 05:36:01.718 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the
 
05:36:04.470 --> 05:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
committee I hope I can answer represent
 
05:36:06.628 --> 05:36:06.638 align:start position:0%
fellows yeah so I wonder if you could go
 
05:36:08.230 --> 05:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
over the um
 
05:36:10.990 --> 05:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
the points that you think are
 
05:36:13.390 --> 05:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
contributing factors to low performance
 
05:36:17.548 --> 05:36:17.558 align:start position:0%
of a student and and also um do you
 
05:36:20.708 --> 05:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
think that students that they tend to be
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the low income category that move a
 
05:36:25.868 --> 05:36:25.878 align:start position:0%
lot from one District to
 
05:36:29.788 --> 05:36:29.798 align:start position:0%
another um how that contributes to low
 
05:36:32.788 --> 05:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
performance maybe moving from one school
 
05:36:35.350 --> 05:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
to another within a district or from one
 
05:36:38.190 --> 05:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
District to another definitely create
 
05:36:42.510 --> 05:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
um creates or widens gaps in learning
 
05:36:47.708 --> 05:36:47.718 align:start position:0%
because they will miss part of the
 
05:36:50.788 --> 05:36:50.798 align:start position:0%
curriculum um they it takes time to
 
05:36:52.708 --> 05:36:52.718 align:start position:0%
adjust to new school so there's the
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
whole social adjustment uh emotional
 
05:36:58.270 --> 05:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
adjustment just getting used to being in
 
05:37:00.830 --> 05:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
a new place getting used to new people
 
05:37:02.270 --> 05:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
um even if you're an outgoing child
 
05:37:04.548 --> 05:37:04.558 align:start position:0%
that's still going to take a little time
 
05:37:07.708 --> 05:37:07.718 align:start position:0%
um but you will have missed some some
 
05:37:09.390 --> 05:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
lessons in a curriculum you'll either be
 
05:37:12.350 --> 05:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
ahead of something even in the same
 
05:37:15.030 --> 05:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
district or you'll be behind so you've
 
05:37:19.628 --> 05:37:19.638 align:start position:0%
lost some learning time if you are not
 
05:37:23.590 --> 05:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
an average or above average learner you
 
05:37:26.510 --> 05:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
will be out of place and need even more
 
05:37:29.270 --> 05:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
support to catch up if you're an above
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
average learn you might be bored and and
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
then there could be some behavior issues
 
05:37:36.070 --> 05:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
if you're you know acting out because
 
05:37:38.750 --> 05:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're bored and you're doing you've got
 
05:37:41.070 --> 05:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
work to do that you already did and
 
05:37:43.110 --> 05:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
you'd rather be doing something else or
 
05:37:44.708 --> 05:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
um so there's all sorts of things that
 
05:37:46.910 --> 05:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
can go on uh but yeah that does create a
 
05:37:49.670 --> 05:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
lot of gaps the more often a student
 
05:37:55.470 --> 05:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
moves um the worse impact it has on
 
05:37:59.350 --> 05:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
their academic outcomes now I I know
 
05:38:01.190 --> 05:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
there are some who who do manage to take
 
05:38:02.750 --> 05:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
it in stride but that generally is with
 
05:38:05.430 --> 05:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
a good amount of family support uh and
 
05:38:07.830 --> 05:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
school support So if it's a planned move
 
05:38:12.110 --> 05:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh you can um lessen some of the impacts
 
05:38:16.830 --> 05:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
but it does have an impact and I oh
 
05:38:18.990 --> 05:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
there was another question about some
 
05:38:20.868 --> 05:38:20.878 align:start position:0%
other factors
 
05:38:20.878 --> 05:38:22.670 align:start position:0%
other factors
um

05:38:22.670 --> 05:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:27.868 --> 05:38:27.878 align:start position:0%
certainly um being from a being part of
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
a family that's living in
 
05:38:33.070 --> 05:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
poverty often has an impact because of
 
05:38:35.510 --> 05:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
not necessarily having the supports that
 
05:38:37.110 --> 05:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
you need outside of school if your
 
05:38:39.310 --> 05:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
family moving frequently could be part
 
05:38:41.590 --> 05:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
of that um you know if a family doesn't
 
05:38:45.030 --> 05:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
have stable housing um
 
05:38:48.270 --> 05:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
also if you have a situation where all
 
05:38:50.708 --> 05:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
of the adults are working they they're
 
05:38:53.590 --> 05:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
working Ser serially like mom works one
 
05:38:56.110 --> 05:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
shift dad works another shift and
 
05:39:00.548 --> 05:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
there's maybe not a lot of adult time
 
05:39:02.510 --> 05:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
spent with a child
 
05:39:05.070 --> 05:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
in fun enriching activities a lot of
 
05:39:06.788 --> 05:39:06.798 align:start position:0%
conversation going on building up that
 
05:39:06.798 --> 05:39:08.590 align:start position:0%
conversation going on building up that
vocabulary

05:39:08.590 --> 05:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
vocabulary
 
05:39:10.670 --> 05:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
um you know just just the the whole
 
05:39:13.830 --> 05:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge of words and conversation that
 
05:39:15.830 --> 05:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
um you would love to be able to have but
 
05:39:18.548 --> 05:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
if if the family's just trying to make
 
05:39:22.230 --> 05:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
sure there's enough income coming in uh
 
05:39:24.070 --> 05:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
to pay the bills and everyone's working
 
05:39:25.990 --> 05:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
as hard as they can you don't
 
05:39:27.868 --> 05:39:27.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily have time to have good long
 
05:39:30.030 --> 05:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
conversations and read lots of books
 
05:39:32.948 --> 05:39:32.958 align:start position:0%
with your children and no judgment here
 
05:39:37.548 --> 05:39:37.558 align:start position:0%
honest um but a child comes in with the
 
05:39:39.990 --> 05:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
deficit of receptive language with a
 
05:39:42.350 --> 05:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
deficit in reading and it takes longer
 
05:39:43.948 --> 05:39:43.958 align:start position:0%
to learn those skills once you get in
 
05:39:47.150 --> 05:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
school so you come in already behind and
 
05:39:50.430 --> 05:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
um you can you know close that Gap some
 
05:39:53.070 --> 05:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
but it takes more people working with
 
05:39:55.788 --> 05:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
that child in
 
05:39:59.548 --> 05:39:59.558 align:start position:0%
school yeah any further further
 
05:40:03.468 --> 05:40:03.478 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
05:40:05.910 --> 05:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
welcome I don't have any other pin cards
 
05:40:08.310 --> 05:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
up here on this bill right now so I'm
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:43.270 --> 05:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
Friday um Thursday Thursday is a session
 
05:40:46.990 --> 05:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
dat do you have any word on if they
 
05:40:50.590 --> 05:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
think they might cancel it due to the
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
weather I have I can't I don't have a
