title of the bill is an act relative to
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks
 
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
this is not about background checks for
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
purchasers of
 
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
firearms it is about taking some small
 
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
steps forward to hope hopefully expedite
 
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
the process employers who are required
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
by state law to obtain background checks
 
00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
must follow before they are able to hire
 
00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.670 align:start position:0%
must follow before they are able to hire
certain

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
employees more specifically IT addresses
 
00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
those situations where a federal
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
criminal history record information
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
record check is
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
required if you are like me any bill
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
that is 11 pages long can be a little
 
00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
shall we say
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelming what I hope I can do in the
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
time you're granting me this morning is
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
try to dispel any concerns you might
 
00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
have I worked with the Department of
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
Safety to craft this bill and they are
 
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
here to speak in support of it I also
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
reached out to all the affected state
 
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 align:start position:0%
agencies to ensure that they are aware
 
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
of it they do have some concerns about
 
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
funding which I appreciate and hope to
 
00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
address um
 
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
today however none expressed any serious
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
reservations I hope that they will not
 
00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 align:start position:0%
do so here today then again that's why
 
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
we have these
 
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
hearings let me break down the bill for
 
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
you it essentially has three parts Part
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
One included in section one of the bill
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
which extends from page one through the
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
first three lines of Page Three provides
 
00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
information on the laws and processes
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
currently in place place and the
 
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
challenges they create as it relates to
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
National record
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
checks part two which is the Lion Share
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
of the bill consisting of sections 2
 
00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 align:start position:0%
through 23 starting on page three line
 
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
four and continuing through line through
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
page 9 line 31 of the bill identify
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
specific changes in statute recommended
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
by the department of safety to permit
 
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
additional state agencies to assist them
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
with the process of collecting
 
00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.629 align:start position:0%
with the process of collecting
fingerprints

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
fingerprints
 
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
part three included in section 24 of the
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill starting on page 9 line 32 through
 
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
Page 11 line three establishes a multi-
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
agency task force to conduct a review of
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
all employment volunteer positions
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
referenced in statute where an FBI
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
record check is currently required
 
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:53.879 align:start position:0%
recommend whether such record checks
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
will continue to be required identify
 
00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
any new positions where a record check
 
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
is currently not required but where it
 
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
should be and identify other specific
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
steps and recommendations that should be
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
taken to ensure that employment related
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
record checks are processed as
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
expeditiously as possible this task
 
00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
force would also identify specific
 
00:08:16.599 --> 00:08:18.270 align:start position:0%
force would also identify specific
funding

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
requirements there are many positions
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire Law requires
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
employees Andor volunteers must pass a
 
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.390 align:start position:0%

record
 
00:08:27.869 --> 00:08:27.879 align:start position:0%
check those positions fall under the
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
purview of the following state agencies
 
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159 align:start position:0%

also numerous Municipal and County

positions that require a record check
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
these record checks are required by
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
state law to protect the public however
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
we are facing a Workforce crisis and it
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
has become increasingly difficult to
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
fill in a timely manner many of the
 
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
positions where these record checks are
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
required candidates for a position are
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
accepting other positions before the
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
record checks can be completed and the
 
00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:11.959 align:start position:0%
turnaround time on requests for
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
volunteers often results in activities
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
or events being understaffed or
 
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
delayed a national record check request
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
must be submitted to the to the FBI and
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%

complete set of fingerprints and RSA 361
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%

Department part two of the bill sections
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
2 through 23 of this bill uh what what
 
00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:28.839 align:start position:0%
what part two section 2 through 23 of
 
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
this Bill does is extend the authority
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
to take a complete set of fingerprints
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
to other state agencies and departments
 
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
with oversight for other employees and
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
volunteers where a record check is
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
required these are quick fixes that will
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
significantly increase the number of
 
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
individuals and locations authorized to
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
complete to collect complete set of
 
00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
fingerprints and address at least one
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
Log Jam contributing to the time it
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
takes to obtain a national record check
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
the bill does not change the number of
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
positions where a record check is
 
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:00.519 align:start position:0%
required or the requirement that
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
agencies will still need to forward the
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
fingerprints and accompanying
 
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
documentation to the criminal records
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
unit within the department of safety for
 
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
their review and transmittal to the FBI
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
or the ways that they transmit that
 
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
information those are much those are
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
more complex questions that deserve more
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
and careful study what part three

1st

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
1st
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
2025 when I first began to explore this
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
issue I thought how hard can it be to
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
reduce the turnaround time all we need
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
to do is scan the fingerprints set up a
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
website push a button send the request
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
in and receive a yes no answer back
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
within minutes if not
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
seconds well with the help of my friends
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
at the department of safety I learned it
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
is not that simple and shame on me for
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
thinking that anything could be that
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
simple after talking with
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
representatives from the criminal record
 
00:13:02.829 --> 00:13:02.839 align:start position:0%
unit and the and assistant commissioner
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
Edwards I am convinced they understand
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
how important it is to quickly and
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
accurately obtain criminal record checks
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
and they understand the need to be able
 
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
to hire people quickly My Hope Is that
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
HB 1197 will offer them some quick fix
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
additional tools to make that happen
 
00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
while at the same time pulling together
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
representatives of other state agencies
 
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
who are most invested in this process to
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
investigate other longer term solutions
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
to ensure that happens I hope you will
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill as ought to pass
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time this morning and
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
I will be happy to try to answer your
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
questions the key word being try thank
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
representative the
 
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
um so just to to distill it down what
 
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
your bill does is it attempts
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
to speed up the record check process
 
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
process it doesn't change who needs to
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
have their record checks it just deals
 
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
with the process of getting the record
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
checks is that correct that's correct
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
okay further questions representative s
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
question um you referenced costs in this
 
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
but I don't see a financial note and I
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure if I missed
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
something um yeah that was a an issue
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
that came up this morning when I was
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
talking with um some um representatives
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
of state agencies um um I I don't I
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
don't know why there was no fi fiscal
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
note I mean the only reason I I I'm I'm
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing is that um because of the
 
00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%
way that I structured it so that there
 
00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
was the task force that would be making
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations about what the cost
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
would be um going forward but I I I
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
don't know why there was no fiscal note
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
attached the the the the the cost there
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
were there will certainly be some costs
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
and when when people from the uh
 
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety come to testify you
 
00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:04.839 align:start position:0%
might want to ask them um there may be
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
there will be some costs for per perhaps
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
for additional um Scanning
 
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
Machines um and um you know potentially
 
00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:17.759 align:start position:0%
some Personnel costs um but uh to answer
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
your question I don't know why there was
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
note represent
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
Muse yes thanks for taking my question
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
help me understand why um there are some
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
changes in your bill that would take
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
place immediately with passage of the
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
bill but there are others that are
 
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
deferred uh until uh a task force can be
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
assembled and make recommendations um uh
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious about your rationale
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
for doing
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
that um well I what I wanted to do was
 
00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:54.519 align:start position:0%
you know get the get get I guess address
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
the policy issue of whether or not other
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
state agencies should should be
 
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
empowered to be able to to collect um
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
fingerprints um so that the department
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
of safety then kind of knew the universe
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
that they were working with um and that
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
and that that could then they could then
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
work with the those agencies to kind of
 
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
figure out exactly what infrastructure
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
would would be needed to support that um
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
I had some conversations with uh people
 
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
this morning uh along those same lines
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
and there was a suggestion that perhaps
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
the effective date for the bill could be
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
pushed out a little bit um but it was
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
really just to try to get them get the
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
ball rolling so that we and and give the
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
department the statutory Authority that
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
they need to start you know figuring out
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
like see no further questions thank you
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%

uh the chair calls uh Victor muzy from
 
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
please morning Mr chairman and members
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for having me
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
this morning uh my name is Victor Muzzy
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
I'm a captain with the New Hampshire
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
State Police in charge of the Justice
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
information Bureau and I'm here to
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
represent the department of safety uh on
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'd like to thank
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative Ms for working together
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
head of uh submitting this to make sure
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
that there was a mutual understanding of
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
what what needed what was needed to help
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
us certainly but I think to answer um
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
what I heard to be sort of the initial
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
question is um as he spoke um the record
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
check process for education has already
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
been identified so it allows an
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
authorized employee of the Department of
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
Education to fingerprint folks for us
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
and so many of these many other rsas at
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
the moment don't do that so it sort of
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
ties our Collective hand as as law
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement being the only folks that
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
can fingerprint for for these other
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
various entities and agencies and so
 
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
aligning all of these statutes certainly
 
00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:10.039 align:start position:0%
opens up that window for us to be able
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
to do that um and allow some of these
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
other state agencies to be able to
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
capture fingerprints for us much like
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is doing in the
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
superintendent offices and things and so
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
that was one idea that we had brought uh
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
up in the in the confines of the
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
conversation to help address um some of
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
the the backlog or some of the issues
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
and so um right now to date we've got I
 
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
think 75 aphis machines which are the
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
electronic machines that we capture
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
fingerprints on placed strategically as
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
best we can throughout the state and
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
we've got another 10 more of those
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
coming um that we will Implement here
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
very shortly as soon as we can we can
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
accept uh some grant money that we have
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
will use to to purchase those with and
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
as we have historically done and so uh
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
the intent here um in concert with this
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
bill would be to provide some of these
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
machines uh to those agencies willing um
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
in the future uh that could fingerprint
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
their folks for us as as part of that
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
process and there's been some interest
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
with some agencies and I suspect more
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
interest once we get these the rsas
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
cleaned up to to more to better align uh
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
with that to be able to actually have
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
them capturing the fingerprints for us
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
and so uh that was one area where um
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
historically I'll say since 2020 I think
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
let's call 2020 the year that that
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
caught up with us and there was several
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
things that happened outside of Co but
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
really related to covid that caused a
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
backlog for us and and uh the governor
 
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
had issued an order obviously um
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
allowing folks to work without being
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted and things and when that
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
order was lifted we saw a huge influx
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
and um an overwhelming workload that we
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
have since completely cleared up and I'm
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
I'm hap happy to say here today that um
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
we've got five available fingerprint
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
appointments in conquered and I think 21
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or something thereabouts and so
 
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
obtaining a fingerprint appointment at
 
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
the moment is not an issue um and and
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
coupled with that the turnaround time
 
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
for providing record checks for agencies
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
that are doing a background check is
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
done within a week from our perspective
 
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
the department of safety's perspective
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
so the backlog is is for all intents and
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
purposes cleared up is non-existent it
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
does does not exist anymore however in
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
the interest of
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
um expanding upon that I I think these
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
this this bill here to align these rsas
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
um respective to that of education is is
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do so we can continue
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
to expand that that allowance I should
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
say to to capture um fingerprints and so
 
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
um again I just wanted to point out that
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
we we no longer have the backlog that we
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
had we've worked through that but
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
obviously it takes some time to catch up
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
from that and and the the the education
 
00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
I guess to to understand that that's
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
that's no longer really a problem for us
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it won't happen again we
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
certainly have busier times of the year
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
than other times back to school and
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
other other things that are happening
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
College graduations and and whatnot that
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
seem to contribute to that but nothing
 
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
like we saw in
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
2020 um
 
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
and so you know we obviously will work
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
very closely the commission I think will
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
work very closely with um on determining
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done I think
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
collectively we probably should look at
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
what background checks are we conducting
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
certainly the department of safety has
 
00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:13.110 align:start position:0%
certainly the department of safety has
no

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to say interest we have
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
an interest in it but we have no say I
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
guess it's up to these other agencies
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
state agencies on whether or not they
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
want to do background checks we we
 
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
certainly are there to provide that
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
service but don't really have an opinion
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
I suppose on on whether or not it's
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate but certainly would love to
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
be part of the conversation so it
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
probably is time to look at you know are
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
there other positions that should be
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
checked um are there some that we're
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
doing now that we don't need to do so
 
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
this is a great time to look at that
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
process overall and see if we can uh
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
make any efficiencies there on a on a
 
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
state level
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
um I think there was one other thing
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
that I was going to say but it escapes
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
my mind at the moment so thank you for
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
my uh hearing my testimony and I'll be
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you is
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
it your understanding that the the this
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
bill will enable you to um enter into
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
agreements with various agencies to
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
place aphis machines in their locations
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
is that and then authorize them to
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
process those is that what I'm
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
understanding I think that's the intent
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know that the changing the
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
RSA speaks to theou that we would have
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%
to have but it certainly will allow us
 
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
to physically put the machine there and
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
have authorized you know employees of
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
that agency fingerprint for us uh the
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
mou I guess I would see that as sort of
 
00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:26.950 align:start position:0%
mou I guess I would see that as sort of
a

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.710 align:start position:0%
a
separate

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
distinct process that we would probably
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
have to enter into as we've we've done
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
in other
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
instances since you already have an are
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
continuing to put these um machines
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
spread out throughout the state is it
 
00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
necessary to then put them in specific
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
agencies like that I mean I could see
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
maybe oplc because they're constantly
 
00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
but a school district does that make
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
sense I'm not really sure I understand
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
how that would work yeah we've had a
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
couple of school districts that have
 
00:22:59.789 --> 00:22:59.799 align:start position:0%
actually done that and the way it's I
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
can think of one in particular um where
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
the the aphis machine it's a portable
 
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
machine that the the police department
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
actually houses I guess but where it's
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
portable they they bring it to the
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
school to be able to use it for that
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
purpose too and so they've sort of
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
collaborate collaborated within that
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
that town or that District to be able to
 
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
do that and
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
so is there a need not at the moment I
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
guess um I think it's more of a
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
convenience factor what we've heard from
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
some agencies is that some of their
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
clientele have to travel great distances
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
and other things so you know obviously
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
most of these machines for state
 
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
agencies would likely be in conquered
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
which again is is probably not
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
convenient for some of the population
 
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
anyways but it's just another option
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
really um and before I forget the other
 
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
thing to mention is we have been I guess
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
graced with the ability to purchase Liv
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
scan machines through grant money
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're about $20,000 a piece what
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't um what we we don't have any
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
funding for other than than budgeted
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
funding is the maintenance for those
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
machines and so um relative to to the
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
costs right out of the gate I can say
 
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
the more of these machines we buy the
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
more maintenance we're going to have to
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
pay on them and we've we've yet to be
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
able to find a funding source uh outside
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
of our our budget to be able to pay for
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
that and maintenance I think on per
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
machine is about
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
3500 a year um and an additional $200 if
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
printer does Nick's money cover that
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
could it be used for towards that Nick's
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
grants uh no no no we historically have
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
bought the machines with uh nship um
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
money which is the national criminal
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
history Improvement project I believe is
 
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
what that stands for okay I envisioned
 
00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:40.039 align:start position:0%
the machines that they have for example
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
at silencer Co if you want to go buy a
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
suppressor um you take they take your
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
prints right there instantly to the FBI
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
and um you quickly get a yay or nay is
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't I'm not familiar with that
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
Arrangement but it it's well it's part
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
of the instant background check system
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
but this is different than the instant
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
background check system correct this is
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
the records you get for an employment
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
check are not the same for the instant
 
00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
background check you just get a proceed
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
or do not proceed right versus this you
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
get the actual list of the offenses
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank depending upon the
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
agency and and what they're authorized
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
to see exactly yes sir okay um
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
representative rhods thank you Mr
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
chairman that this may have been
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
addressed and I apologize if it was so
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
my understanding is you know you can
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
have you can have somebody that has had
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
their fingerprints taken you know say to
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
work at a school and you know maybe they
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
go get a job as a bank um as a teller
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
would would this make it where if the
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
person has already had their information
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
captured that they don't have to keep on
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
redoing it to you know maybe pull from a
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
central location or no no every check is
 
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
done independently for the purpose that
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
it's needed so if they switch
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
professions it's a it's a brand new
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
check and the other thing that gets
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
cautioned is stale records so if you
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
were fingerprinted yesterday and your
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
record is released today tomorrow your
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
record could be different in theory so
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
okay it it doesn't really transpire time
 
00:26:07.389 --> 00:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you thank you for my
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
followup this may be something you're
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
not sure of there was a there was a
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
study committee for the centralization
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
for fingerprints for background checks
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
do you think that is something maybe I I
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
know I was on it and we've never had a
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
meeting on it you think that's something
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
I should try to maybe pursue a little
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
bit more or would it not affect this at
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't know that it would affect this at
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
all I guess so okay thank you you're
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
welcome represent here
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
G thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um on page two when
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
it lists the seven uh departments are
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
these departments are the Departments
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
you would like to have that privilege of
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
doing background
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
checks these are the Departments that I
 
00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
would like to have
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
the potential of having a machine to
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
take fingerprints should they choose to
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
I guess or have the Manpower I
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
mean sure all right are the only one
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
that's doing it now is the education
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
department is that correct correct okay
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
you so from a from a cost perspective
 
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
your assumption would be that the
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
agencies who receive these machines
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
would use them
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
essentially would train Uh current
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
Personnel correct in their use so it
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't involve actually hiring any
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
people I don't believe so unless those
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
agencies would have a need to hire
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
additional resources to be able to do
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
that I can't speak to that but I think
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
the intent at least my thought would be
 
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
that yes they'd have pre-existing
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
employees that would be trained and
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
would be able to to do that and one
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
more and uh a little bit of of a
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
different question
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
um the the fact that these one thing I'm
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
trying to understand is is is there
 
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
because more people will be responsible
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
for for fingerprinting is is there more
 
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
potential uh for these records to be uh
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
mishandled in some way or made public in
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
in a way that we wouldn't want yep no
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
great question so currently and I'm
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
probably getting into the weeds here a
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
little bit too much but I'll give you
 
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
the background anyhow um as far as law
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies go the the
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
interface I'll call it to to Department
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
of Safety is a two-way interface so in
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
other words um a law enforcement officer
 
00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
takes a set of fingerprints um on their
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
machine and within 10 or 15 minutes they
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
actually get an initial response from
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
the FBI which includes some of that
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
person's criminal record um and that's
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
done so that the FBI doesn't care what
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
your name and date of birth is they care
 
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
what your fingerprints look like and
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's how they identify everybody so um
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
I've put in a name that I associated
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
with those fingerprints and it gets you
 
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
know sent to the FBI and often times you
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
know people lie when they get arrested
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
about who who they are and things like
 
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
that and so that information is provided
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
back to that machine in in the form of a
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
message um if you will so that I guess
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
that department or that that officer can
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
can see that okay I have the correct
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
person here and a little bit about their
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
criminal record and things like that
 
00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:14.519 align:start position:0%
relative to bail and and things like
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
that so the intent and the idea here
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
would be the configuration for these
 
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:21.519 align:start position:0%
machines uh that are that at these
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
agencies would be one way so they would
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
only be submitting fingerprints to us uh
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
that a safety criminal records unit um
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
and not receiving any return information
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
from the FBI and so there would not be
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
that chance in that capacity or in that
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
venue for them to mishandle anything or
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
have even have access to to any
 
00:29:43.509 --> 00:29:43.519 align:start position:0%
information on the machine um so they'd
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
be configured slightly differently I
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
configuration to follow on to that
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
question using the machine is even
 
00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
better because there's no physical
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
record there's no fingerprint card that
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
can be copy or anything like that
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
correct it's just all sent out and gone
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and the theory with you know the
 
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:04.519 align:start position:0%
old Inked fingerprint cards as they say
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
is um a you've got ink which is messy
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
and you're dealing with a piece of paper
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
and things um and and the aphis machines
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
are pretty intuitive I guess and
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
obviously capture a picture of your
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
fingerprint which is cleaner and clearer
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
and um lends to less error I guess and
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
so really the only concern is making
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
sure that we would train these folks um
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
I'll say a core cluster of these folks
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
at each agency that would be authorized
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
by by way of these statutes to take
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
those fingerprints and you know we do
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
that now with several different agencies
 
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
anyway to make sure they're taking
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
quality um um prints and understand what
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
they're doing and why they're doing what
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
we know how how to do it the right way
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
and things and so really um the good
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
news there and the only other concern is
 
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
well what happens if these people aren't
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
as well trained as the law enforcement
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
agencies and entities and things and and
 
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
we we've got I guess scenarios now where
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with non- law enforcement
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
folks that are involved in the criminal
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
justice information gathering process
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
and it seems to be working well and the
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
better news is is that um they're
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
submitting that stuff to us and they're
 
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
also submitting the paperwork that goes
 
00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
along with the background check to us
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
and so we have the opportunity at the
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
department of safety to make sure that
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
we are validating I guess the
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
information that we're seeing
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
electronically against the paper records
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
that we would be getting from them to
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
process the entirety of the check and so
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
um checks and balances in the process to
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that again non-law enforcement
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
folks that would be involved in this
 
00:31:32.629 --> 00:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
process um not that they would
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
intentionally do anything wrong but you
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
know errors and mistakes aren't
 
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
happening because it's it's all coming
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
to us and we can verify and validate
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
FBI I see no further questions thank you
 
00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.789 align:start position:0%
FBI I see no further questions thank you
thank

00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:47.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
you the chair calls um Attorney John

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy and members of the criminal
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
justice and Public Safety Committee for
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
the record my name is John Williams I'm
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
the legislative director for the
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human Services and
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to provide information to
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
this committee uh relative to HB 1197 uh
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
HB 1197 as you've already heard from the
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor uh certainly comes to you
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
with very important goals here which is
 
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:30.919 align:start position:0%
to allow for those who are employed uh
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
at least in the sections referencing the
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
department or volunteering in certain
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
areas to making sure that they're being
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately screened but given the
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
option to having uh those particular set
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
of fingerprints taken by those executive
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
branch agencies identified in the
 
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
legislation um it's already been
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
identified that um the bill does not
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal analysis from the
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
legislative budget Assistance office as
 
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
you know uh the attorneys who draft
 
00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
legislation make it determination
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
working through the office of
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
legislative Services whether or not that
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
there is an impact greater than
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
$10,000 uh if you uh refer you to RSA
 
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
1444 that requires that all bills having
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
a fiscal impact greater than $10,000
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
shall shall uh have a fiscal note um on
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
it the good news is is that if it wasn't
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
identified for a robust fiscal analysis
 
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
so you could understand the um
 
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation issues and other resource
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
issues required uh under RSA
 
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
1446 uh Roman 5 again that's 1440 colon
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
46 Roman five uh uh which is under the
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
legislative budget Assistance Office
 
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
statutes that this committee is vested
 
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
like all other standing committees uh
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
both in the house and the Senate under
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
that RSA to uh upon a motion of a
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
Committee Member to having in in of
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
course with the majority of the
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
committee uh having a fiscal analysis
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
done in the bill um that would perhaps
 
00:33:57.389 --> 00:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
be helpful to this committee in any
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
other committee where this bill May
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
travel so you get a better understanding
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
with some baseline information as to the
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
economics behind the bill um the
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
department is here specifically on two
 
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
specific sections of the bill I think
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
that section one of the bill that the uh
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor and working along with the
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety did a wonderful job
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
describing in section one of the bill
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
the current process and you'll see that
 
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
it's an incredibly detailed and
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
important process that's followed when
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
they're doing these particular criminal
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
background checks and as it relates to
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
agencies with this 24 plus section Bill
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
there are two sections that I'm here
 
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
today on not on the other section but
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
section 7 of the bill and section nine
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
so drawing your attention to page uh
 
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
page one um and I'm going to get my
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
glasses because I think it's probably a
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
different number it's page four um and
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
at the very bottom starting on line 36
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
it discusses in section 7 the use of
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis for therapeutic purposes and
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
the alternative treatment U requirements
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
and it Contin on the following page on
 
00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
page uh five uh relative to the
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
requirement that uh individuals or are
 
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
agents under therapeutic cannabis
 
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
to it's here yeah P page
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
four line 36 section section seven I
 
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
need to slow down is what I need to do
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and number
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
36 okay section go ahead chairman wor it
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
would not be the first time I'd be
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
testifying on the wrong Bill and
 
00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:33.079 align:start position:0%
apologizing so here we go so as as you
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
see uh moving to the second page
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
starting from lines one through line 16
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment that would add the
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
the following to the sentence uh the
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
applicant meaning uh the alternative
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
treatment uh Center or their agents
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
shall shall submit with a release form a
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
complete set of electronic F
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
fingerprints taken by a qualified law
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency U which is your local
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal level law enforcement agencies
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh or uh in current law but struck here
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
an authorized employee of the Department
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
of Safety and now this is the additional
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
part or an authorized employee of the
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and services so our
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
read of this particular section as it
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
relates is a shall it's a mandatory and
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this legislation
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
which I certainly will get to uh as part
 
00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599 align:start position:0%
of uh my commentary uh is uh upon
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
passage at least for this section so the
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
representation I I would make to this
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
committee not knowing the exact answers
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
is certainly working with the Department
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
of Safety and and perhaps also other
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
agencies that currently are doing this
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
we can get a better handle on the
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
resources that are necessary to doing
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
this clearly there is likelihood of
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
greater than
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
$10,000 uh at least as it relates to our
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
section of the bill uh for getting these
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
very important machines uh we actually
 
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
did a pilot uh within the last decade
 
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
where we were starting to do very much
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
what this bill is suggesting uh to help
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
with the the backlog it was very good to
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
hear from the testimony from the
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety from Captain Muzzy
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
that they they are um and I don't want
 
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
to over quote because it's obviously
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
recorded but that they've caught up with
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
the um with the backlog which is great
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
news to hear so those individuals
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
particularly who are seeking employment
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
uh at uh various uh can certainly be
 
00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
employed sooner sooner than later um I
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
now want to draw your attention on the
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
same page page five to line 27 page five
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
line 27 which is section n of the bill
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with residential care and child
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
placing agencies so as you'll see here
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
this also requires uh that a criminal
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
background check through the FBI is
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
required for individuals who are
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
employed by child care agencies giving
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
you the numbers there are thousands of
 
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
individuals who do this very important
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
work for the state of New Hampshire so
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
the um position that this could be
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
absorbed using um current resources I
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
think at least in this specific instance
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
and I think providing that information
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
to safety would be helpful to for them
 
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
to understand that our current staff are
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
already dedicated ated to reviewing
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
licensing and other issues in in this
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
particular area and that if we're
 
00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
required now to take on the additional
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility as I mentioned we're
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
talking over thousands of individuals
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
that it would be contemplated that we'd
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
need an additional staff position or at
 
00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
least a part-time staff position to be
 
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
able to accomplish what is required
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
under this legislation so with that said
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
I I just would respectfully request that
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
this committee consider the fiscal
 
00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:26.839 align:start position:0%
implications as it relates to the
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
legislation and perhaps on motion of a
 
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
member of this committee have the LBA
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
directed to completing a financial
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
analysis so that you the bill sponsor
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety would have a better
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
understanding as to what it would take
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of the resources at the end of
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
the day we go to section 24 of the bill
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
and rounding the corner towards the end
 
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
of my commentary um is the Task Force
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's created just a couple quick items
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
for your consideration uh as a part of
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
that is you'll note that that the
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
reporting date for the initial report
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
was very thoughtfully put on November
 
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
1st of 2024 and my understanding in
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
speaking with the bill sponsor who's a
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
wonderful person I've worked with him
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
many times in the past he cares very
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
much about New Hampshire citizens that
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
uh the first report would be an
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide the legislature
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
with feedback in terms of what these
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
costs were to be built into the 2627
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
budget um I would respectfully say
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
because the the uh effective date is
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
upon passage this would be in 202 5 we
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
do not have any Appropriations and I'm
 
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
sure the department of safety that
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
performs this uh uh current function now
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
already has within their budget at least
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
identified certain resources uh to
 
00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
making their shop be able to do what
 
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
they do but we do not I represent uh to
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
this committee we do not have the
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
resources to be able to do what this
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
legislation contemplates so at a minimum
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh going to the last page on the
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
effective date for your consideration
 
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
you may want to consider pushing that
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
out to June 30th of 202 5 that's the end
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the B any of the current budget to
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
allow for a thoughtful response in the
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
task force report as to identifying
 
00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
necessary resources and any language
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
changes because I do understand that the
 
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
goal here is to establish a policy in
 
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
this legislation it would have been uh
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh the Department's preference to uh
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
keep the task force portion of this bill
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
and have this further issue explored but
 
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
I do understand and appreciate after my
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
conversation with the bill sponsor that
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
there's a desire to set the policy now
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
not later it is an option and one that
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
we were certainly um going to suggest to
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider having that
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
language Shelf ready for hb2 as part of
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
the next banian budget rather than
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
mandating items without having an
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation associated with it even if
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
you do push out that particular
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
effective date so with that said the
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
only other drafting consideration uh
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy that I would suggest the
 
00:40:52.109 --> 00:40:52.119 align:start position:0%
committee that on page 10 of the bill
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
you'll see under Roman D um three which
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
is the last series of the um duties of
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
the items that they're going to be
 
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing for this uh task force that
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
there be consideration to putting in
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
additional language that would say
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
something to the effect of identify
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
necessary funding and other resources
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
including Staffing and other IT issues
 
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
uh for the state executive branch
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
agencies and importantly political
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
subdivisions because you'll see that
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
Beyond just touching upon our agency and
 
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
other state agency it also touches upon
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions within the state
 
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
so they're would be particularly
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
important the other item for your
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
consideration because I know that the
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
legislature typically allows for late
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
filed legislation if recommendations are
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
coming from legislative um created
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
commission's task force in this occasion
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
we in the task force you have uh the
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
department of safety the commissioner
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
being the lead and then the state
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
agencies there's no reference to a
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
legislature and I apologize to Bill
 
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor it's just something I picked up
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
when I was reading through the language
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
again for the third time uh over the
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
last few weeks that there may be some
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
consideration to having a legislator
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
because that would carry greater weight
 
00:41:59.950 --> 00:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
than to getting it into uh either the
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
budget or some type of remedial
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
legislation if you determine that what
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
is in the four corners of this very
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
important bill uh that need to be
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
changed or tweaked based upon the
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
information so it's the cart and horse
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh analysis essentially that we would
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
propose with that and leaving some
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
oxygen in the room that concludes my
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
commentary before the committee and I am
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
available to take
 
00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:22.839 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um with regard to
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
the two sections you pointed out that
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
you said um would incur an immediate
 
00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:30.559 align:start position:0%
cost I I'm the way I'm reading it I may
 
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
be wrong it says or it doesn't say it
 
00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:36.559 align:start position:0%
says shall be completed by a qualified
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
agency or an authorized employee so how
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
do you read that to me that you have to
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
do that right away and represent Roy
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
that is a great question and I am an
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
active member of New Hampshire bar my
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
current role is legislative so I'm here
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
in my legislative capacity and I'm sure
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
you can ask the question of others uh
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
who will be coming to testify
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
that I think there's enough ambiguity
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
there because if the public sees this
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an expectation that
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to come to the
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
if they're seeking a job uh in the child
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
care um um with a Child Care Agency as a
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
worker that we're going to be up and
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
running on the effective date of this
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
bill and I think that that's not a fair
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
representation of that and it's possible
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
that um that um your thoughts that this
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
is discretionary um would be one re View
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
and one um a certain um position on the
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
language but the regular public is just
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
going to read this and saying why aren't
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
they opening up shop here and our
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
responses because we don't have the
 
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
resources nor do we have a memorandum of
 
00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
understanding which does not require
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
legislation we can work those out with
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
the um Department of Safety also we're
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
talking about certification and training
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
for the staff it's not just a matter of
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
using existing staff it's staff that are
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
trained and certified in this very
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
important area around confidentiality
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
issues and and how to to run it so I
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
know it's a little bit longer winded but
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
I think the answer to your question is I
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
think you rais a good point that it
 
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.079 align:start position:0%
could be viewed as discretionary uh
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
we're taking a more cautious approach
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
that one could make the uh similar
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
argument because of the word shall and
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
right now if particularly in the um area
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
of uh the first one I identified with
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
the shell if they could go to a local
 
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:16.839 align:start position:0%
law enforcement person walks up there
 
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to take their fingerprints
 
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
or the department of safety so it's not
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
like safety can say oh did you try your
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement agency uh it's in
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
statute you you could go there it's an
 
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.670 align:start position:0%
statute you you could go there it's an
or

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
and I would imagine the public would say
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
nope you're responsible for for doing
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
this because it's in law but I do agree
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
with you that your your your take on
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
that is a re re um a
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
discretionary he gther thank you for
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question um what was the date
 
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
that you wanted to push out yes so if we
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
go to the final page of the bill on page
 
00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
11 on line S it currently reads reads
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
the remainder of the ACT shall take
 
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
effect upon its passage and it's just
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's just a suggestion to this committee
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
that if the goal here is to align this
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
as the bill sponsor uh very thoughtfully
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
said to be built into the budget you
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
really have to have the other language
 
00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
aligned with that to allow that
 
00:45:14.589 --> 00:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take place and if you
 
00:45:16.109 --> 00:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
want to establish policy now that
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
effective date should be June 30 June
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
30th of 2025 which ends the Binum for

on House Bill 1295 and invite sponsor to
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
bill good morning uh I am actually going
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
to be introducing this bill on behalf of
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
representative Bale the prime sponsor
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
I'm also a co-sponsor on the
 
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
bill as it currently stands therapeutic
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients are held to a higher
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
legal standard simply by virtue of their
 
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
status as a particular uh uh as needing
 
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
a particular form of relief um in the
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
event that they commit the same exact
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
crime as anyone else in this in the
 
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
state they face a higher
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
charge now personally I think this is
 
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
interesting because the defining Factor
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
as to whether uh whether or not someone
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
is certified as a qualifying therapeutic
 
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient is a health matter it's
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
not a moral
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
matter if in fact they do transgress in
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
that way they already and still will if
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed um will have their
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
certification revoked and they will be
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
subject to the existing charges for this
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
crime which is sale of
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis what this bill does is simply
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
remove the legal in inequity while
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
leaving the consequences of revoking
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
one's certification it is a
 
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
straightforward measure and I believe it
 
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
deserves a straightforward
 
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation from this Committee of
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
OTP uh thank you for your time and
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
consideration I have passed around the
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
prime sponsors uh letter to the
 
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm happy to take
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
questions but I also see that uh
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas is here and
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
she probably get uh can probably answer
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
can thank
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
else represent Thomas
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
she good morning honorable members of
 
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
is Wendy Thomas I represent the town of
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
marac Hillsboro
 
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
12 and um I support this
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
bill okay so uh the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
program progr in New Hampshire was
 
00:48:28.349 --> 00:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
established in
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
2013 that's 11 years ago um and it was
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
passed by an admittedly older
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
legislation New Hampshire is known for
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh having members that that are that
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
tend to be a little older the
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
significance of this is that our
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
generation the older generation was
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
taught that cannabis is a horrible drug
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's used by black people it's used by
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
brown people it's used by criminals
 
00:48:58.750 --> 00:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh when we established this program
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
people saw the need for a therapeutic
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis program to be established in
 
00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:05.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire however they couldn't
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
really disengage from the Cannabis
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
equals criminal activity and so we we
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
allowed the program to go forward but we
 
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
put in very significant guard rails
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
because some people believed that this
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
was going to initiate criminal activity
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire guess what 11 years later it
 
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
has not um for the record also I am a a
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
patient in the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
program I have been since
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
2017 and since 2017 there has not been
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
one day that I have not used therapeutic
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis I use it for chronic
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
pain and in the last two years I use it
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
cancer uh
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
so in addition to this recently the US
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
government has uh released a report find
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh with the findings that cannabis is
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
not addictive cannabis is not a gateway
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
drug and cannabis is effective as
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
medication this is really good news for
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
th those of us in the
 
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.829 align:start position:0%
th those of us in the
program

00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:15.559 align:start position:0%
so I understand when the program was
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
established that we wanted guardrails in
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
there we thought there was going to be
 
00:50:21.549 --> 00:50:21.559 align:start position:0%
all of these bad people remember the the
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
hoopla when we um established uh
 
00:50:26.589 --> 00:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
dispensaries around New Hampshire and
 
00:50:27.789 --> 00:50:27.799 align:start position:0%
everybody was like not in my
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
neighborhood not in my neighborhood we
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
have a dispensary in marac and nobody
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
even knows it's there it's very discreet
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's very quiet um this is a self-
 
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:39.990 align:start position:0%
it's very quiet um this is a self-
policing

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
policing
 
00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
program if you get into trouble we
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
expect to be punished I mean we're not
 
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
above the law but if we get into trouble
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
because of the program our card our
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
access to the program is also revoked no
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
one wants to take that chance certainly
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
not someone who's sick uh so I'm just
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
here to remind you that just because we
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
are sick just because we need effective
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
medication that does not make us
 
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
criminals and so hold us accountable
 
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:15.799 align:start position:0%
just as you would everybody else but
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
just because we use cannabis don't give
 
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
us extra
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
penalties I'll take any questions if
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
anybody has any thank you um
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
so the current state of the law is if
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
you are a um member of the Cannabis
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
program and you purchase your your your
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
cannabis from a a dispensary and you
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
sell it to someone you would be subject
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
to the penalties of 318 b26 correct and
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
if someone else gets arrested for
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
selling marijuana they too would be
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
subject to 31826 correct there are um
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
and I know that Michael HT is is in the
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
audience too there are added penalties
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
just for being in the Cannabis program
 
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
okay that's what I'm trying to get at
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
what are the added penalties do you want
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
me to just defer to yes if you could
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
sure that's he would answer it better
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
than than I could okay um representative
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
sik thank you very much and thank you
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and I apologize
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
when I bolt out in a moment I'm going to
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
go meet my elementary schoolers but um
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
could you explain a little bit about um
 
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
what are the uh currently legal in New
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire reasons why people would be
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
able to get therapeutic
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis so to get in the program there
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
is an application and on the application
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
right now we have listed criteria so you
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
have to have a significant chronic
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
illness a terminal illness um PTSD um is
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
included so there's a list of criteria
 
00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:49.799 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is that the the
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
Physicians have to use that list and
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
there are other things that that could
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
apply for example menstrual cramps um
 
00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis is very very helpful for
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
menstrual cramps um long covid um we're
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
finding that people are getting um IBS
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
irritable bowel syndrome not Crohn's
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
disease so technically that would not
 
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
fit into the program however cannabis
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
greatly helps um digestive
 
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
issues um so so we're trying to change
 
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
that I've got a bill right now in that
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
would let any physician who is
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable of cannabis recom the
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
program they can't prescribe the program
 
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:28.799 align:start position:0%
they can recommend the program to any
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
patient whom they think it would benefit
 
00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:33.799 align:start position:0%
so it would it would keep us from
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
practicing medicine and coming back
 
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
every year putting in new criteria but
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
criteria reprentative rhods thank you Mr
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
question yes it so the the Cannabis that
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
you're speaking of is a prescription
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
correct no medical medical cannabis is
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
prescription medical Physicians so MDS
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
and and people who are qualified and I
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
think we had um nurse practitioners um
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
they can recommend the program they
 
00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
cannot prescribe the program because of
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
how it is scheduled and it's an illegal
 
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
substance according to a federal um but
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
they're they're changing that they're in
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
the process of changing it so it is not
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
a prescription it is a
 
00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:25.990 align:start position:0%
a prescription it is a
recommendation

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
however then you work with people in the
 
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
in the dispensary who have knowledge and
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
and I used to work in a dispensary so
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
the first thing we would do is sit down
 
00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:35.799 align:start position:0%
with a patient go over their medical
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
history um match up their their symptoms
 
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
and and get them onto a a therapeutic
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis program low and
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
slow which means that you have a tiny
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
amount thank you for your testimony oh
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm a little confused so um
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
because of the way we Define a
 
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
prescription there isn't you're saying
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
that there isn't another provision in
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law that would actually
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
make it illegal for somebody to give
 
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
their therapeutic cannabis away to
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
somebody else or to sell it to them is
 
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
that no okay no I'm not that I don't
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
Maybe This Is Lost in Translation no if
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
if I purchase cannabis through the
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
program and then I wanted to sell it to
 
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
somebody that's illegal whether I'm in
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
the program or
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
not um you're you're still you look like
 
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
you're a little confused followup so the
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
the thing that makes it illegal is this
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
specific statute or is there another
 
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
statute where that conduct would be
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
prohibited under New Hampshire
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
law oh I see what you're saying
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
um I believe that it's this statute um
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
however so so this addresses therapeutic
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis specifically however if
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
somebody sells cannabis on the street um
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you're I'm not I'm
 
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
not sure I think um director halt would
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
be the one to answer that go
 
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
ahead I I think the I think the root of
 
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
it is just um my confusion over whether
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
or not there may be a redundancy in our
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
law so for example do we have two laws
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that cover this conduct
 
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
one is in this statute and one is maybe
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere else I believe that that's
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
what's happening yes so so there is
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
there is a penalty for selling cannabis
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
um if you're not in the program if you
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
are in the program you have that same
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
penalty with an added penalty be just
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
because you're in the program thank
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
Hol good morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
Michael Holt I'm the administrator of
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program with
 
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
Services um I'm happy to answer
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
questions um I didn't plan to testify
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
but um I'm I'm sure I can help a little
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh here and eliminate the um
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
technicalities of the bill um the
 
00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
department doesn't take a position on
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
this bill um as the uh the sponsor and
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas indicated there
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
are there is an extra penalty for
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients um in New
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state law if they sell
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis to somebody else RSA
 
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
referenced in the bill creates penalties
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
for anyone who sells cannabis
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's 318 b26 a whole section on
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
penalties that includes um the sale of
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
uh of
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis when the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
law was passed in
 
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
2013 an additional provision was added
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
to 318 b26 and that's referenced in line
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
seven and8 of the bill the
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
repeal so 318
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
b26 Roman
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
9A establishes an additional penalty
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
that additional penalty in again in
 
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:29.559 align:start position:0%
addition to the penalties that already
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
exist for SE for selling cannabis for
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
anyone the additional penalty
 
00:58:38.109 --> 00:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
establishes for any amount a class B
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
felony a maximum term of imprisonment of
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
more not more than seven years and a
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
fine not more than
 
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
$300,000 in addition to the 200,000 or
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
500,000 or the other felonies involved
 
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
with selling cannabis so what the intent
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
of this bill as I believe it is to
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
eliminate the extra penalty for
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
patients if they are convicted of
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
selling any cannabis to an unauthorized
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
person to the best of your knowledge is
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
there a similar law that affects people
 
00:59:17.789 --> 00:59:17.799 align:start position:0%
that sell their prescription drugs like
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
if I have a prescription for oxycodone
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
and I sell it is there a double penalty
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
for those for that or just I'm not aware
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
of any extra penalty for the sale of a
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
prescription medication except for for
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis correct thank you represent
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
M and I know your knowledge is primarily
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire but I wonder are there
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh are there other states that sort of
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
have this two-tiered penalty uh for
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
people who sell therapeutic cannabis I
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
not aware of any state that does but I'm
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
not aware of any state that doesn't
 
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative sitech you have a
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
question uh Mr actually uh if I'm
 
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
wondering what are typical dose at large
 
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
cannabis thank you for the question um
 
01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
Everybody metabolizes cannabis a little
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
differently um and so I have um worked
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
and I have met some people that use 100
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
migrs as a dose now if I had 100
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
milligrams I would be asleep that you
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
you can't overdose I mean you'll you'll
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
just it's not like alcohol you're not
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
going to end up in the ER you're just
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
going to go to sleep when I take a dose
 
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
I average between 2.5 and 10 milligrams
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
10 is a bit high so I take 2.5 to 5
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
during the day I usually take it twice
 
01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
during the day and you're never going to
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
see me inebriated because that's if
 
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
you're using the therapeutic program to
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
get high you're using it incorrectly
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
it's to manage our symptoms so I take
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
the lowest dose that I need to manage my
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
pain and then I take 10 milligrams in
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
the evening and that helps me sleep
 
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
night so I I take what are called micro
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
does so that's why it's very difficult
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
to to prescribe it you need somebody who
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
understands the how it works with the
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
human body and typically even with with
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
patients that have experienced
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
experienced with cannabis we start them
 
01:02:58.269 --> 01:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
at 2.5 to 5
 
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
milligram thank you I think it's got a
 
01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.789 align:start position:0%
milligram thank you I think it's got a
follow

01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
up it's just amazing because 27 grams
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
make an ounce so this these are very
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
tiny amounts yes that's the whole the
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
again the therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
is not to get
 
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
inebriated thank you represent
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
Muse just one more question um how when
 
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
this is actually dispensed when when
 
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis is is it's
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
dispensed are we talking about something
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
that size of a coffee can something the
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
size of prescription bottle drug bottle
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
I mean how much of it actually commonly
 
01:03:40.829 --> 01:03:40.839 align:start position:0%
gets dispensed so first of all it
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
depends how you you take it so so I very
 
01:03:47.069 --> 01:03:47.079 align:start position:0%
rarely smoke cannabis I don't I cough
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not I'm not good at that
 
01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:50.839 align:start position:0%
the only time that I smoke cannabis is
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
when um I'm in very severe pain because
 
01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
it hits the pain like that you know but
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
then I can't drive I can't read I can't
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
do anything except watch TV and eat
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
Doritos um but uh you know some people
 
01:04:03.359 --> 01:04:04.190 align:start position:0%
Doritos um but uh you know some people
take

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
capsules um and the the capsules could
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
be 2.5 or 5 milligrams or you know even
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
higher um I have cream that's infused
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
with with cannabis and so um I use that
 
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
on my joints because I have arthritis
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
from Lyme disease um I use Edibles I use
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
gummies most of the time that's that's
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest thing so it's and
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
it's usually sold in in up two ounces so
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
you're looking at if you've seen the
 
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
pictures of cannabis you know the flower
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
the bud like one to two buds would
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
be you know how much it's dispensed as
 
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we're only allowed to
 
01:04:45.789 --> 01:04:45.799 align:start position:0%
buy 2 ounces of cannabis at a time
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's a bill going forward that would
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
allow 4 ounces which would bring it into
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
line with what's being proposed for the
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
legal legalization of cannabis program
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you if I'm not mistaken the the
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
amount allowed monthly is based on
 
01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
the the grams of THC not necessarily in
 
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
other words you could buy a batch of
 
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
brownies that doesn't count the weight
 
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
of the brownies isn't it's correct it's
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
the am it's the product and and um I
 
01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
just want to correct you said monthly
 
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
and it's not monthly we can we can buy
 
01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
every 10 days okay yeah okay but my
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
point was is it's not calculated based
 
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
on the weight of the product you're
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
buying it's the amount of the pro THC or
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
marijuana correct correct correct thank
 
01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.470 align:start position:0%
marijuana correct correct correct thank
all

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
Newman I just want to clear up the
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
difference between CBD and THC it's the
 
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's the amount of not CHC medical
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis it's just it's the
 
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
amount of THC that is in that's allowed
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
I think CBD is like CBD um is simply
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
another cannabinoid um so you have THC
 
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
and you have you know the the plant
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
contains all kinds they're called
 
01:06:01.269 --> 01:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids but THC is the one that
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
gets you inebriated so that's the one
 
01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:05.799 align:start position:0%
that you you kind of have to be careful
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
but in the therapeutic program there are
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
some products that have high high high
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
THC um if you if you you know if you
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
take that you're going to be inebriated
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
now for my cancer I take a product
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
that's 50% THC but I take a little tiny
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
tiny amount and and I take it at night
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
so I can I can sleep it off um and the
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
other thing with a product being high in
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
THC is the first time you use it you're
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
going to be knocked off your block you
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
know you're going to be knocked you're
 
01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
going to be very drowsy and everything
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
and then you're going to learn just like
 
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
we learned when we when we started with
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
whiskey or scotch or anything like that
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
you don't take as much the next time
 
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
because you don't like that feeling you
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
know so CBD is a non euphoric canono
 
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
that's used um it's used to relax the
 
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
body it's used um a lot for muscle
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
relaxation but if you have pain you have
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
to have some THC not much but
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
some okay thank you that's all the pot
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
questions for today do you is it
 
01:07:14.109 --> 01:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
relative to the bill or about okay wait
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
ahead so is this essentially
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
housekeeping legislation it seems like
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
oversight it is housekeeping um I
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I wouldn't classify it as an
 
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
oversight as as more as it was it was an
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary protection that people
 
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
believed were needed for the program
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
when the program was initiated program's
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
been running fine for 11 years we don't
 
01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:45.799 align:start position:0%
have the criminals and the monsters that
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
that were anticipated so this is
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
just making it more more just it's just
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
making it more just that was not that
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
wasn't good but it's making it more more
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
socially accept not that's wrong too
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's making it more fair there we go
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
taking away the double penalty there you
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
hearing sorry take a um 15minute recess
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:26:38.430 align:start position:0%
 
back

01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
they're not here today Jen's not here
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
Bradley's notle not
 
01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.709 align:start position:0%
Bradley's notle not
here

01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I'm opening an executive
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 1295 five and I
 
01:26:53.159 --> 01:26:54.830 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 1295 five and I
move

01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
move
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
OTP seconded by representative here at
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
gaite I'll speak to the motion um after
 
01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
hearing the testimony on the bill it
 
01:27:06.030 --> 01:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
does not make any sense to have an extra
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
or an additional penalty or more
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
enhanced penalty for someone who sells
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
their their cannabis versus someone who
 
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
sells their their other prescription
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
drugs this seems to have been targeted
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
just at cannabis patients it's already
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
illegal to sell your to sell marijuana
 
01:27:27.629 --> 01:27:27.639 align:start position:0%
so the having an enhanced penalty for
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
that versus someone who for example um
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
sells their oxycodone um doesn't make
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
any sense at all so that's why I would
 
01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:37.719 align:start position:0%
support passing the bill and encourage
 
01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
others to do so as well would you like

01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
bill good morning members of the
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
criminal justice
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
committee I'm introducing uh HB 1339
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
FN I'm representative John Stone
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
representing Sullivan 8
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
and basically this bill as filed would
 
01:29:28.109 --> 01:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
involve a change in the background
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
checks done by the state and by uh
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
utilizing Nicks I have uh two amendments
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
to this bill based on some conversations
 
01:29:39.149 --> 01:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
I had with constituents uh some gun
 
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
dealers and some other individuals who
 
01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
had concerns over the amended
 
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
language so one of the bills I have uh
 
01:29:48.189 --> 01:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
going to be submitting for the amendment
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
is that we had some issues that arose
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
last week during testimony on returning
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
firearms and the amendment that I have
 
01:29:59.550 --> 01:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
outlined which is uh
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
531 basically I passed out to everybody
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
this morning would uh put some
 
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
firearms if anyone has any questions I
 
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:19.639 align:start position:0%
would most likely entertain them um so
 
01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
we have two amendments it your proposed
 
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
the to
 
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
ignore 520 in favor of 531 is that
 
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
correct yes after a discussion this
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
morning with the Dual amendments it
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
looks like I would like to request a
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to further review uh
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
0531 okay um can you just briefly tell
 
01:30:43.109 --> 01:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
us what the bill does um as far as NX
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
goes uh the new Amendment would it end
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
up uh utilizing Nicks for the return of
 
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
firearms and set parameters with a
 
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
requirement of court dates business days
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
to facilitate that uh during some of the
 
01:30:56.669 --> 01:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard last week which
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
caused this amendment to be drafted
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
there was definitely uh some issues when
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
it comes to the returning of firearms
 
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
after someone is no longer considered to
 
01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.550 align:start position:0%
after someone is no longer considered to
be

01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
prohibited is this related to um
 
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
protective orders or what is this
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
related to initially it was uh under
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
protective orders at
 
01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
173b and also under 633
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
3A which is also criminal proceeding
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
such as bail orders and other uh issued
 
01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority by the court so it
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't specifically apply only to One
 
01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
c3b issues it would refer to someone who
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps is out on bail they're uh they
 
01:31:37.149 --> 01:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
have gone to court their court has
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
charges have been dismissed to
 
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
facilitate their guns being
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
returned okay did you find out if this
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
is an early bill or not this is not an
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
early Bill therefore uh okay we're not
 
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
restricted on the time frames to get it
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
done okay um unless anyone has question
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
questions I'll assign a subcommittee and
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
we can dig into it
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
further go ahead representative
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
site it's this um is the I don't see the
 
01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
issue the connection between a
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
background check and return of weapons
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
is the is the nub of this that you need
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
a background check if your weapons are
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
being restored what what's the Nexus
 
01:32:14.669 --> 01:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
here representative what happens
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
currently in the cases of a 173b if
 
01:32:19.229 --> 01:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
you're under a protective order that
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
protective order
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
expires once that order expires as you
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
heard testimony last week or you may
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
have not if I can't recall if you were
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
here or not but an individual can go to
 
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
a Firearms dealer purchase a brand new
 
01:32:32.109 --> 01:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
firearm that same day however the
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
firearms that are being held by the
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
police or by an FFL would actually be
 
01:32:37.950 --> 01:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
required to have a court order to
 
01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:39.719 align:start position:0%
release those Firearms which means a
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
separate appearance before a court of
 
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
that AB
 
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
zuse I I do have a a question because
 
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
one of your amendments seems to be
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
almost like a completely different bill
 
01:32:59.950 --> 01:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
from the one you originally proposed um
 
01:33:01.629 --> 01:33:01.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
 
01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
2024 uh
 
01:33:07.629 --> 01:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
0531 um on line one States amend the
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
title of the bill by replacing it uh
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
with with the following and then on line
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
five it says amend the bill by replacing
 
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
all after the enacting Clause I don't
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
actually see anything in the amendment
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
um that contains anything from the
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
original Bill unless I'm missing
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
something uh no the new Amendment which
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
531h is that the one you're referring
 
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
to that one would be replacing the
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
language itself this is kind of a
 
01:33:36.990 --> 01:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
background issue which should be
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
Germaine to the original
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
Bill your Amendment actually replaces
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
your bill correct
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
okay it depends whether or not it's
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
germine whether or not it can be
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
replaced the whole bill as long as it's
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
Germain to the topic of the original
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
bill um which is using using the state
 
01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
as well as Nicks to restore fire so
 
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much the same subject um
 
01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
okay further
 
01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none I will Appo a
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%

bill

01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%

Linda Harriet Gite out of NASA and I
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%

01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
um providing the information for this
 
01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.550 align:start position:0%
um providing the information for this
bill

01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
um the bill would mandate state that law
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement reports all suspected hate
 
01:35:56.430 --> 01:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
crimes to the Civil Rights unit of the
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office within 72
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
hours it would also mandate that the
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office create and
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
maintain a public database of these hate
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
crimes and submit an analysis of the
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
data to the governor Senate President
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
and Speaker of the House on an annual
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
basis this database would not include
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
any identifying information for either
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
the victims or suspects in these
 
01:36:28.990 --> 01:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
cases this legislation is necessary
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
because currently there is no mandate
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
for this information to be gathered or
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
maintained by any law enforcement agency
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
upon reaching out to various Municipal
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
police departments none were able to
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
detail a process they have for reporting
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
these types of
 
01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:47.719 align:start position:0%
crimes we worked with the Attorney
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
General's office in drafting this
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
language and they have said they will be
 
01:36:53.709 --> 01:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
sending written testimony to the
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%

this no I think that they're going to be
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
be folks after me that probably would
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%

01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman for allowing
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%

01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
taking a question Linda representative
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
goth right I apologize um I just wanted
 
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
to ask knowing what you have gone
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
through in Nashville I wonder if you
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
could illustrate for the committee what
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
members of the city board and Nash have
 
01:37:50.109 --> 01:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
gone through and some of the things that
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
have happened that uh cause you to bring
 
01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:54.679 align:start position:0%
this bill forward
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
oh well I can probably give I've been
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
here since 79 and I probably give tons
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
of examples of things that have happened
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
that have not gone into this category
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
that should have gone into this category
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
and and we should have records of it and
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
um around hate crimes and I think even
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
last year I think when we had a
 
01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
representative that um there was
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
graffiti um um put on a um the side of a
 
01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
building downtown in Nashua you know um
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
speaking of him and he was um Latino
 
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
so we've looked at we have we have
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
currently today there's a black
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant in one of um downtown in NASA
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
and they actually plased the nword all
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
over his property and his business so
 
01:38:51.310 --> 01:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
for us we feel that we're not not
 
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
getting the the data captured where it
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be captured and that should be
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%

I was 8 years old and had someone spray
 
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
paint our driveway with a 20ft swastika
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
and juw go home um and um I did not live
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire at that time but it was
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
was handled by the uh local police
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
department being saying basically oh
 
01:39:59.070 --> 01:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
that's too bad and there was no further
 
01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
action taken um wasn't reported anywhere
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
recorded anywhere um we know from
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
organizations outside of New Hampshire
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
that for example uh crimes of
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism have increased
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
tremendously in the past several years
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
um but it's not tracked in New Hampshire
 
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
as a New Hampshire specific resource we
 
01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:22.679 align:start position:0%
know that hate crimes against people of
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
color have increased across the state
 
01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
but again there's no specific data and
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
without data we don't have a way to
 
01:40:33.629 --> 01:40:33.639 align:start position:0%
address it right um I I had been hoping
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
to add to this bill something requiring
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
school districts to report incidents at
 
01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
their schools and discovered some
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
technicalities that we have to work
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
through before we can do that but um the
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
the reality is that these incidences are
 
01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
continuing to happen the um they're
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
isn't great recordkeeping there's not a
 
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
great way to see what the trends are so
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
that we can work on ways to address it
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully stop the cycle of hate crimes
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
and look for ways to remedy the issue
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's really important
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we create a better and stronger
 
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
database by having this go to the the
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
AG's office thank
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:41:21.390 --> 01:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
an thank you Mr chair and and thank you
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative zelik um I'm wondering I
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
know you know we had spoken about um the
 
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
process of restorative justice um what
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
we call it in our school district is
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
restorative community and I think a lot
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
of times when we're talking about
 
01:41:37.709 --> 01:41:37.719 align:start position:0%
compiling the data uh what we're
 
01:41:39.149 --> 01:41:39.159 align:start position:0%
thinking about we need to do with that
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
is Target law enforcement but I think
 
01:41:42.990 --> 01:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
there are other Alternatives and i' I'd
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
love for you to speak to that because
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
this kind of um notion of restorative
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
justice is just that especially for
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
youth who may um be doing for a lack of
 
01:41:55.470 --> 01:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
a better way dumb kid stuff um that ends
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
up uh you know that is considered a hate
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
crime and in other ways that we can
 
01:42:01.149 --> 01:42:01.159 align:start position:0%
address that and help to remedy the
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
problem absolutely I mean I'm I'm not an
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
expert in the law I'm not a lawyer um
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't want to pretend to be
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
but we know that uh juveniles at a
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
certain age are are sometimes charged as
 
01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
adults and including hate crimes which
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
also have Federal implications but
 
01:42:16.109 --> 01:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
beyond just New Hampshire
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
implications um restorative justice
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
models look at fin ways of having people
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
identify why they created a problem or
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
why they took an action that they did
 
01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
and then making whole the person that
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
they damaged so for example if um
 
01:42:35.709 --> 01:42:35.719 align:start position:0%
someone hung a noose in front of
 
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
someone's home and caused them trauma
 
01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
and fear as a result of the Noose and
 
01:42:42.669 --> 01:42:42.679 align:start position:0%
and words that might be affiliated with
 
01:42:46.589 --> 01:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
it um we might you know we could punish
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
them by giving them a fine assessing
 
01:42:50.109 --> 01:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
them a fine or giving them jail time
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
which may or may not depending on the
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
levels of it of it um may or may not
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
accomplish a goal of having them no
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
longer create uh commit those kinds of
 
01:43:00.189 --> 01:43:00.199 align:start position:0%
hate crimes whereas a restorative model
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
would allow us to help them to identify
 
01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:03.639 align:start position:0%
the cause of it I don't know that that
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
goes directly to this bill no um but I
 
01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
think that by tracking like if there are
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
pockets of crime like if we know for
 
01:43:13.629 --> 01:43:13.639 align:start position:0%
example that in one Community it's
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
happening a lot then maybe we look at
 
01:43:16.589 --> 01:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
what are the Dynamics in that community
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
that can be repaired thank you I just
 
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak to what this St is
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
useful for yeah thank
 
01:43:27.149 --> 01:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
you that oh representative Newman I just
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to verify that there's no
 
01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
identifying data in this that it's a
 
01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
random number that would just describe
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
what what happened right it's a random
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
number but perhaps you know like if
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
we're seeing for example that in one
 
01:43:40.270 --> 01:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
town or Community there's a huge number
 
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
and in other towns there aren't then we
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
have a better idea of how to address and
 
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
and look at
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
resources thank you chair calls uh
 
01:43:50.639 --> 01:44:04.629 align:start position:0%
resources thank you chair calls uh
representative

01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you again for allowing me to
 
01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
speak uh my name is Maria Perez I'm a
 
01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
state representative from District 43 in
 
01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
Milford I'm here to uh speak in support
 
01:44:15.679 --> 01:44:16.589 align:start position:0%
Milford I'm here to uh speak in support
of

01:44:16.589 --> 01:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
1462 one of the reason that I'm
 
01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill because
 
01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
probably many of you know I was a victim
 
01:44:25.950 --> 01:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
of couple times
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
already um harassing uh because of my
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
background and many people in my my
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
culture they they've been getting emails
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
hateful emails telling them that they
 
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
need to go back where they came from or
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
they don't have the right to to be
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
alive couple months ago I received a
 
01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
email from a why nationalist group here
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
in uhans telling me
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
then my family needs to go back to
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
Cuba and then I'm I'm a myo just because
 
01:44:59.070 --> 01:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
my mom is an indigenous person and my
 
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
dad is a a white
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
person and then my f my family is not
 
01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
welcome here and then he put my personal
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
information in the website which is very
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
danger that puts my family in danger and
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
this is not the first time that this
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
person is doing it it's been happening a
 
01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:19.719 align:start position:0%
couple times and every time that I go to
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
the police department I mean what I've
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
been told is like please come back and
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
tell us when something real happened so
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
that mean I have to wait till I get hurt
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
or one one of my reals get hurt for
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
someone to do something about hateful
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
and hate crimes here in new hire that's
 
01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
one of the reason I'm doing this because
 
01:45:41.709 --> 01:45:41.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not the only one many families going
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
through this and people not paying
 
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
enough attention people think that new
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
hire is safe for people who look like me
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
but it's not we have a lot of hate and
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's happening more and more and people
 
01:45:56.589 --> 01:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
now feel like more they can be more
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
vocal about
 
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
it please pay attention we need to keep
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
people safe we're not here to erase
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
anyone in anyone we're not here to say
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
I'm better than you or you're better
 
01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
than me I just want to have it
 
01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
equal equal R like everyone
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
else I don't feel safe anymore to be
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
honest every time that I come in and
 
01:46:24.750 --> 01:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
testify or every time that I vought in a
 
01:46:27.790 --> 01:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
bill my name gets put in public and
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
sometime not on the right way I don't
 
01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
feel safe hate crimes are happening and
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
it happen more because people feel they
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
have the right to do it thank you thank
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%

01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
all of the Reps for introducing this
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
bill um after I approached
 
01:47:21.629 --> 01:47:21.639 align:start position:0%
representative Murray wanting to make
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
hate crime information more transparent
 
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with lgbtq Community
 
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
organizing in New Hampshire since
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
2017 and have called been called upon
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
many times to Rally train de escalators
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
and community members to respond to hate
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
activity I was somewhat surprised to
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
find out that local law enforcement in
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are not even required to
 
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
report hate crimes to the New Hampshire
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office it's clear
 
01:47:48.589 --> 01:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
that we need to take some steps toward
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
better data collection and transparent
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
parency I feel generally safe in my
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
community of do as a white queer person
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
who isn't often seen as transgender or
 
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
non-binary but that is not true for many
 
01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
others no matter who we are whether
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
we're black indigenous Latina Asian or
 
01:48:09.189 --> 01:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
white lgbtq cisgender or heterosexual we
 
01:48:10.990 --> 01:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
all want to live in safe communities
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
where we don't have to fear violence
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
where our voices are heard and our
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
rights are respected no one wants to
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
live in a community where crimes based
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
on hate and bigotry happen but
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately hate crimes have happened
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
in many corners of our state some of
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
these make the news but not all do
 
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
instead of turning away from these
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
problems everyone living in the granite
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
state no matter their race gender sexual
 
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
orientation should have transparent
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
information about the hate crimes that
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
are happening near them those targeted
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
by hate crimes should also have their
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
safety and privacy respected without
 
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
being forced into News Headlines by
 
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
creating a database that includes
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
pertinent Anonymous information about
 
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
types of hate crimes committ committed
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
in towns and cities across New Hampshire
 
01:48:55.149 --> 01:48:55.159 align:start position:0%
and by requiring the Attorney General to
 
01:48:57.149 --> 01:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
summarize and analyze hate crimes and
 
01:48:59.470 --> 01:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
report to the governor Senate President
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
and Speaker of the House of
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives we can begin to better
 
01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
assess and analyze the problem and help
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters make informed decisions
 
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
you see no questions thank you for your
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
testimony chair calls captain
 
01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:28.669 align:start position:0%

01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
good morning again Mr chairman and
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh again my
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
name is Victor Muzzy I'm here to
 
01:49:33.629 --> 01:49:33.639 align:start position:0%
represent uh the New Hampshire
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety uh on this topic
 
01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
and would simply say that we we have a
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
neutral position I guess uh relative to
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
um this bill what I can offer is
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
currently under RSA 106 b14 C which is
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
the Uniform Crime reporting system
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
statute and I guess I'll read that in
 
01:49:56.109 --> 01:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
part to uh which says law enforcement
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
agencies operating within the state of
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire shall submit crime reports
 
01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Safety Division of
 
01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
State Police based on the specifications
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
prescribed by the Federal Bureau of
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
Investigations criminal justice
 
01:50:08.910 --> 01:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
Information Services Uniform Crime
 
01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.070 align:start position:0%
Information Services Uniform Crime
reporting

01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:50:13.629 --> 01:50:13.639 align:start position:0%
program uh full sentence there um
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
basically the report it then the RSA
 
01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
then goes on to talk about number of
 
01:50:18.189 --> 01:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
offenses and arrests and crimes
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
occurring Within jurisdictions um
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements um relative to
 
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
when those will be compiled and it says
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
July 1st of the following year and we
 
01:50:30.669 --> 01:50:30.679 align:start position:0%
basically have to make those reports
 
01:50:32.430 --> 01:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
available to to several entities and
 
01:50:34.350 --> 01:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
members of the public if you know upon
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
their inquiry uh section two talks about
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
um if a law enforcement agency has no
 
01:50:41.709 --> 01:50:41.719 align:start position:0%
records management system with niers u
 
01:50:44.189 --> 01:50:44.199 align:start position:0%
relative to ners capabilities that the
 
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
department of safety would be um provide
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
them a means by which to report and
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
that's important because currently uh as
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
part of that process and part of the
 
01:50:56.910 --> 01:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
ners or UCR requirements we and all all
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
agencies that operate in the state are
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
currently collecting um bias motivation
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the following
 
01:51:05.790 --> 01:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
categories race ethnicity and ancestry
 
01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
religious bias sexual orientation bias
 
01:51:11.589 --> 01:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
disability bias gender bias and gender
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
identity bias so we're already capturing
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
that anyhow um I suppose
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the bill I think
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
maybe that should be shared on a more
 
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
intimate basis with the Attorney
 
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
General's office for the purpose that
 
01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
out is outlined in the bill but I
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
thought it was important to at least
 
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
articulate that we are capturing that
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
now um and and collecting that now and
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
obviously have have to make it available
 
01:51:37.709 --> 01:51:37.719 align:start position:0%
to those that don't have a records
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
management system in order to do that so
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
I offer that to the committee for for
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
their consideration relative to uh what
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
you've heard already today and I would
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions thank you
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
is that information that you collect or
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
any of it even the the the redacted
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
versions of it available to the
 
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
public the tally I guess is available to
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
the public by way of our ners uh
 
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
reporting website um and we have two
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
areas now that we we manage and maintain
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
one of those is more geared towards data
 
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
analysts I guess it's a little bit
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
harder to kind of sift through it's it's
 
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
um not as pretty to look at I guess but
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
it's there we are currently working on
 
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
um what we call um with our vendor it's
 
01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
uh a TOS website and that's theme
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
oriented um I forget what the acronym
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
stands for But ultimately it's it's a
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
more userfriendly
 
01:52:31.069 --> 01:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
um website that presents information in
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit more of a um I don't want
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
to say generic but easily more easy to
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
digest um
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
presentation and um we have three themes
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
on there right now with the intent to
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
expand that to six um and that will
 
01:52:49.149 --> 01:52:49.159 align:start position:0%
include some domestic violence and I I
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
forget what the two the categories are
 
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
and so we we do have that I'll say
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
a desirable format I suppose but it it
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
is there and so um but again I think as
 
01:53:06.149 --> 01:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
I as I understand and read this bill
 
01:53:07.790 --> 01:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's it sort of sounds like the intent
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
would be to present that information to
 
01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
the AG's office and then for them to
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
draft or create a report that's a little
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
bit more consumable I guess to those
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
interested in so
 
01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:21.030 align:start position:0%
interested in so
um

01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
currently this information um is
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
available is it not from the FBI from
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
their website doesn't it track for
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
example you can sort how many crimes
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
against who who was theant who what was
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
the weapon used that type of thing yes
 
01:53:38.350 --> 01:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
is that would that information that's
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
currently available from the FBI be any
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
different than
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
this well and I I what I can say is we
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
have a repository um that can be
 
01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
searched specific to New Hampshire you
 
01:53:51.310 --> 01:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
know and which is separate really from
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
the FBI's database the FBI's numbers I
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
guess should include New Hampshire's um
 
01:53:58.589 --> 01:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
and so we have a third party vendor that
 
01:54:00.430 --> 01:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
we work with that also works with the
 
01:54:02.830 --> 01:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
FBI where we report um and make those
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
things available to our public I guess
 
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
sort of separate from the FBI but I'm
 
01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
just asking is is it is the information
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
currently available or would this be
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
redundant or not would this be something
 
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
new that we could I see this as sort of
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
an add-on to what we're currently doing
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
to maybe make it a bit more consumable
 
01:54:25.149 --> 01:54:25.159 align:start position:0%
and make it a bit more user friendly or
 
01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
usable okay I guess what we provide is
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
um basically a tally you know you had
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
this number of crimes that were reported
 
01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:35.719 align:start position:0%
as having this type of bias and so it it
 
01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't offer I guess the total picture
 
01:54:40.709 --> 01:54:40.719 align:start position:0%
that maybe the intent of this bill would
 
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
meaning it doesn't necessarily relate
 
01:54:44.669 --> 01:54:44.679 align:start position:0%
the victims and the suspects and the
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances um at the moment so that's
 
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
I guess an add-on to what we're
 
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
currently doing this is to maybe make
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
that a little more
 
01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
robust my my last question would be how
 
01:54:59.550 --> 01:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
do in other words I want to be I want to
 
01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
be confident in the data that I get so
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
if if how does the um State Police or
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
any Department submit data with regards
 
01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
to a hate
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
crime is it after its investigated and
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's actually been determined to be a
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
hate crime or just that there was an
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
allegation that it was a hate crime
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
because what we don't want is to get
 
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
numbers from somewhere that just have
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
allegations that it could inflate the
 
01:55:26.830 --> 01:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
numbers artificially correct and that
 
01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
was a thought that I I had and we had
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
discussed and so at the moment I'm not
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
exactly sure if it's simply the fact
 
01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
that there was an allegation there or
 
01:55:38.669 --> 01:55:38.679 align:start position:0%
whether it was determined I'll say
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
through a conviction that it was in fact
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
a hate crime so I think we have to
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
probably get a little bit more clarity
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
around where that determination is made
 
01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
and how if a victim is certainly
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
reporting that is that really what we
 
01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
intend to capture and Report out on or
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
is the intent to capture and Report out
 
01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
on proven cases I guess that were found
 
01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
to be you know hate crime motivated um I
 
01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
think a conviction will be too high of a
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
bar because plea Bargains happen and
 
01:56:08.669 --> 01:56:08.679 align:start position:0%
then it goes away but I think there
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
should be some type of bar perhaps that
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
that the public can have confidence in
 
01:56:15.069 --> 01:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
the numbers right and I don't you know
 
01:56:16.990 --> 01:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's I guess it would be C or case
 
01:56:18.629 --> 01:56:18.639 align:start position:0%
dependent or circumstance dependent to
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
say okay just because it was reported
 
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
this way through the investigation they
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
met this threshold and therefore we can
 
01:56:26.589 --> 01:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
categorize it as a you know I don't know
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
what that threshold would be in the
 
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
investigation but certainly I mean a lot
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
of this is is would be up to the
 
01:56:34.109 --> 01:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
victim's determination it's how the
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
victim feels given the circumstances and
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
it through the investigation I would
 
01:56:40.669 --> 01:56:40.679 align:start position:0%
assume it's not something just made up
 
01:56:42.669 --> 01:56:42.679 align:start position:0%
it would have to be quantifiable
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
certainly an image painted on someone's
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
driveway I would think is pretty clear
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
and convincing to the law enforcement
 
01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
agency that okay yep
 
01:56:53.069 --> 01:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
um I guess it would be case specific but
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
MH okay probably you're right conviction
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
level's too high I think it needs to be
 
01:56:58.910 --> 01:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
through somewhere in the middle the
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
investigation representative
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
rhs thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm I'm hoping you
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
can help me clarify something so under
 
01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:09.910 align:start position:0%
can help me clarify something so under
RSA

01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
651 and it's
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
651 B6 and a whole bunch of numbers um
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
it says when substantially motivated to
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
commit the crime because of hostility
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
towards the victim's religion race Creed
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation is defined in RSA uh
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
2149 so this is under the extended term
 
01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
of imprisonment is what I'm looking at
 
01:57:38.510 --> 01:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
so how would If This Were to be enacted
 
01:57:41.870 --> 01:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
how would it be reported differently
 
01:57:43.629 --> 01:57:43.639 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm reading that it already
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
is reported differently if there's an
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think this bill would cause it
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
to be recorded any differently but
 
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
maybe summarized differently or again
 
01:58:02.589 --> 01:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
what we're currently reporting is just a
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
tally to say this crime that was
 
01:58:07.629 --> 01:58:07.639 align:start position:0%
reported was had a biased motivation
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
what I think the bill does is extend
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
extend that to gather and track the
 
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
surrounding circumstances information
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
about the victim information about the
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
suspect and so certainly the and I did
 
01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
this morning at the enhanced penalty
 
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
statute that you're reading
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I think the intent there is if at the
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
conclusion of the trial the finding is
 
01:58:32.709 --> 01:58:32.719 align:start position:0%
guilty and there is some provable
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
element suggestive of a bias motivation
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
or a hate crime then I think that's what
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
that statute is speaking
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
to so I don't know if that really
 
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.270 --> 01:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure either okay
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
01:58:56.589 --> 01:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
new thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:58:58.830 --> 01:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm really
 
01:59:00.350 --> 01:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about especially when we're
 
01:59:02.430 --> 01:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
talking about hate crimes um the
 
01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639 align:start position:0%
prevention right we saw in our school
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
district uh kind of an explosion for a
 
01:59:09.870 --> 01:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
while there of um of a variety of um
 
01:59:12.069 --> 01:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
things that happened within the school
 
01:59:14.910 --> 01:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
system but did not rise to the level of
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
a police investigation and so uh you've
 
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
said you know that this information is
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
gathered we've talked about kind of what
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
the threshold is I also think that that
 
01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
would be very important uh information
 
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
to anonymously uh because you know uh
 
01:59:30.069 --> 01:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
underage children things like that um
 
01:59:31.470 --> 01:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
but that would also be useful
 
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
information for us targeting um
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
prevention and so I'm wondering is is
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
that information or to your knowledge is
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh would information that is happening
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
within the school district that doesn't
 
01:59:45.149 --> 01:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily rise to the level of an
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
investigation is that also Quantified in
 
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
a way that can be useful for targeting
 
01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
getting um prevention not that I'm aware
 
01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
of I what I would Envision is if the the
 
01:59:57.550 --> 01:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
district or the the school thought it
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
Rose to the level to call the police
 
02:00:01.390 --> 02:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
certainly if the police came and took a
 
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
report and and took that information
 
02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
that would be the only way that we the
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
state would end up to my knowledge that
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
W with that at all so if if the school
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
is privy to information that they don't
 
02:00:12.910 --> 02:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
believe Rises to the level of calling
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
the police then I would say we would
 
02:00:17.229 --> 02:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
through this means would not have that
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
that information which which is
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
important um if that's the overall goal
 
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Stone thank you
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
question so just to clarify if it's a
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
juvenile offense would that necessarily
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.629 --> 02:00:39.639 align:start position:0%
tracked if the suspect were a juvenile
 
02:00:42.069 --> 02:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
it would be tracked the difficulty would
 
02:00:44.589 --> 02:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
be is um certainly for this purpose it
 
02:00:48.270 --> 02:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
would be anonymized anyways relative to
 
02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
so I I think
 
02:00:51.629 --> 02:00:51.639 align:start position:0%
tracking it whether the suspect is a
 
02:00:53.149 --> 02:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
juvenile or an adult doesn't really
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
matter for the purposes of this because
 
02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
there is no pii associated with it it's
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
an instance of a hate crime and so where
 
02:01:03.870 --> 02:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
normally if if in an adult situation we
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
may release the arrese name and data and
 
02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
information relative to that we wouldn't
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
release the juveniles now nothing would
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
change relative to this we still
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do that but this is not really
 
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
what this is speaking to it's it's
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
generalizing the data I guess to see
 
02:01:21.069 --> 02:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answers the question but
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
I may be more follow
 
02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
up so an example is a call for criminal
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
mischief on property it's a swas sticker
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's been spray painted is that going
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
to be coded as a hate crime or is it
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
going to be coded strictly as aival
 
02:01:38.189 --> 02:01:38.199 align:start position:0%
Mischief call it's going to be coted as
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
a hate crime currently yep okay thank
 
02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
Muse just wanted to to know if you you
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
could elaborate on what you mean by a
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
tally so so for instance when you say
 
02:01:55.950 --> 02:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
that a tally is publicly available is
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
that something like just the the number
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
of hate crimes it's it's an indications
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
in the reporting of that event that
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
there is some bias motivation okay so
 
02:02:09.870 --> 02:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's fairly generic at the moment
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
meaning it's determined somewhere in the
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
investigation and so you know the
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
example that representative Stone gave
 
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
certainly a smashed mailbox with no
 
02:02:21.069 --> 02:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
indication that it involves some bias is
 
02:02:23.069 --> 02:02:23.079 align:start position:0%
just that criminal mischief criminal
 
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
mischief that clearly has an indicator
 
02:02:29.069 --> 02:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
like an Insignia that that's offensive
 
02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
um is going to be reported as that and
 
02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
so current data Gathering is is whether
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
or not it's present it's a yes no type
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
answer you know is is this investigation
 
02:02:46.069 --> 02:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
or is this crime um or part of
 
02:02:49.229 --> 02:02:49.239 align:start position:0%
it motivated by some bias yes or no I
 
02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
mean so it's it's kind of that generic I
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
guess at the moment so that's where the
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
tally comes from and that's broken down
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
by a fence for us and we can break it
 
02:02:58.229 --> 02:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
down by a few other things location and
 
02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
County and and whatnot but it's I guess
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's sort of that simple at the moment
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
to say now relative to the bill we
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
obviously in the confines of that
 
02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
investigation have who the suspect is
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
who the victim is and several other
 
02:03:15.629 --> 02:03:15.639 align:start position:0%
factors that this this bill speaks to in
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
and putting that picture together a
 
02:03:19.470 --> 02:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
little better but at the moment it's is
 
02:03:22.189 --> 02:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
this crime bias motivated if so by what
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
bias one of the six or seven that that I
 
02:03:31.069 --> 02:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
presented follow Muse followup
 
02:03:31.079 --> 02:03:32.990 align:start position:0%
presented follow Muse followup
yeah

02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:03:36.189 --> 02:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
so I understand that there are there's
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
probably more data that is available uh
 
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes that you're not
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
putting up in the public tally
 
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
um would it be possible using the data
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
that you collect now um to do something
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
like um uh in in addition to Simply
 
02:03:56.830 --> 02:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
talling up tallying up the uh the uh the
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
number of incidents to be able to
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
describe uh for instance uh where the
 
02:04:05.229 --> 02:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
communities where these incidents are
 
02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
taking place or the counties where these
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
incidents are taking place um which
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
groups um have been uh you know how
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
group different groups are are being
 
02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
targeted by these incidents in a way
 
02:04:19.229 --> 02:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
that it would actually like let's say
 
02:04:22.109 --> 02:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
let somebody a member of the public be
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
able to look at a particular town or
 
02:04:27.390 --> 02:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
Community to get an idea or are more
 
02:04:29.549 --> 02:04:29.559 align:start position:0%
hate crimes Happening Here than in other
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
places certainly yeah I think we we can
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
do that um with what we currently
 
02:04:37.870 --> 02:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
capture and the and the way that it's
 
02:04:40.030 --> 02:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
being captured sort of behind the scenes
 
02:04:42.549 --> 02:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
so to say the extent by which we can
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
break that down in how many different
 
02:04:46.109 --> 02:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
ways I I can't answer that but I I think
 
02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
we have some room to be able to paint a
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
um clearer picture with what we are
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
capturing and what our current
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
capabilities are thank
 
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.229 --> 02:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill I think the only thing that I kind
 
02:05:12.669 --> 02:05:12.679 align:start position:0%
of noticed is
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
um as I was reading through it in on
 
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
line 15 it says the of the suspects and
 
02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
as long as unknown is okay for the
 
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
purposes of the bill that that might be
 
02:05:29.229 --> 02:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
sufficient and I say that because
 
02:05:33.149 --> 02:05:33.159 align:start position:0%
currently according to FBI ucci ners
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
reporting um race is only required for
 
02:05:38.189 --> 02:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
arrests and so if we're getting into
 
02:05:40.589 --> 02:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
reporting the race of suspects who in
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
theory have yet to have been arrested
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
for something
 
02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
that how do we capture that are we
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
mandated to to capture that because we
 
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
believe it's a hate crime and for the
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
purposes of this bill we we should be
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
asking those questions is it based upon
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement's perception or is
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
it based upon the uh the involved
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
participants their their self-report of
 
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
that information and so not so much a
 
02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
downfall I guess but a point of clarity
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
for the bill to say um that's one of
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
those difficult subject I guess it
 
02:06:14.549 --> 02:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
depends on the intent um I I think it
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
may have more value if it's based upon
 
02:06:19.390 --> 02:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of of the overall
 
02:06:21.310 --> 02:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
intent if it's based upon the perception
 
02:06:25.470 --> 02:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
of the officer but I know that that's a
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
difficult topic also because we don't
 
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
want to make that wrong we don't we
 
02:06:30.310 --> 02:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to have that information be
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
inaccurate or incorrect and so that I
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
guess causes pause and and and not so
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
much concern but just an
 
02:06:41.709 --> 02:06:41.719 align:start position:0%
observation um the only other concern
 
02:06:44.589 --> 02:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
that I have is the format you know in
 
02:06:44.599 --> 02:06:46.109 align:start position:0%
that I have is the format you know in
which

02:06:46.109 --> 02:06:46.119 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
um this bill would expect us and I guess
 
02:06:51.189 --> 02:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
I say us the department of safety to be
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
able to convey this information to the
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office only because
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
we are the aggregator of that on a
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide basis we had a point of
 
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
contact for the FBI uh Uniform Crime
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
reporting U program and we administer
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
that program and so we spend a lot of
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
time every year um helping the local
 
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
departments ensure the accuracy and
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
timely submission of their data and so
 
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:21.390 align:start position:0%
timely submission of their data and so
um

02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:24.030 align:start position:0%
 
I

02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
think making sure that the way that
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
we're reporting that or able to report
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
that to the Attorney General's office um
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
is is in
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
a an easy format in a format that's
 
02:07:36.549 --> 02:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
consistent with how we're currently
 
02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
Gathering it and the ability for us to
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
break that down otherwise there may be
 
02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
some additional expenses if we have to
 
02:07:43.549 --> 02:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
reconfigure the current platform in
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
order to correctly report out the way
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
the the bill would would um request the
 
02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
only other thing that I'm surprised
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
there and maybe there is a local um
 
02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
Department here that's going to testify
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
to this but certainly having them post
 
02:07:57.629 --> 02:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
this information on their website I have
 
02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
to presume is going to come at some cost
 
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
um you know how that gets presented when
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
that gets presented um things like that
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
um certainly for us I mean we have a
 
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
website so we would certainly fall into
 
02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
that and I guess I don't have an answer
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
to that um I assume we we have a Web
 
02:08:17.470 --> 02:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
Master if you will on standby on salary
 
02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
or what have you that probably wouldn't
 
02:08:21.069 --> 02:08:21.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily cost us anything directly
 
02:08:23.709 --> 02:08:23.719 align:start position:0%
but um I guess the logistics or the
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
practical application there's some not
 
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
concerns but
 
02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:31.270 align:start position:0%
concerns but
just

02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
considerations thank you representative
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
Newman I have a question about um I
 
02:08:40.549 --> 02:08:40.559 align:start position:0%
tried to find a definition of hate
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
crimes and could not find one in the law
 
02:08:45.030 --> 02:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
but it it took me to the the uh part of
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
the law that was ex you talked about
 
02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
extended sentences but then later you
 
02:08:53.470 --> 02:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
said that that that if there is an ARR
 
02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
if there is not an arrest if you don't
 
02:08:58.270 --> 02:08:58.280 align:start position:0%
arrest someone for the crime it's just
 
02:09:00.510 --> 02:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
reported do you have any information at
 
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
all that that is provided to the
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
attorney general so the Attorney General
 
02:09:06.549 --> 02:09:06.559 align:start position:0%
could make a decision about whether
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
reported I'm not sure I like that we're
 
02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
giving the Attorney General's office now
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
no I'm just saying that the the bill as
 
02:09:18.910 --> 02:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
it's written G
 
02:09:20.669 --> 02:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
says to the attorney general will make
 
02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
the determination what needs to be
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
reported so so he would have to know
 
02:09:29.229 --> 02:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
what kind of information is available
 
02:09:31.549 --> 02:09:31.559 align:start position:0%
correct and my question is what do you
 
02:09:33.149 --> 02:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
have any kind of information that's
 
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
available if arrest if an arrest is not
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
made or or yes because the crime itself
 
02:09:42.350 --> 02:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
is still reported and again the way it's
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
the current reporting reporting process
 
02:09:47.669 --> 02:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
is happening is if the investigating
 
02:09:50.189 --> 02:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
agency feels feels that the crime is
 
02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
motivated by some bias even though an
 
02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
arrest is not made that case is flagged
 
02:09:56.109 --> 02:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
with a yes meaning that's one of our
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
numbers in the tally and it's broken
 
02:09:59.470 --> 02:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
down further by Will which of those
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
biases is it and so the the arrest is I
 
02:10:04.030 --> 02:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
guess kind of Irrelevant for the
 
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
purposes of reporting my comment was
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
relative to the capturing the race of
 
02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
suspects so if I simply have a suspect
 
02:10:12.750 --> 02:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
and I can't prove or feel like I can't
 
02:10:14.830 --> 02:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
bring the case forward and prosecute it
 
02:10:16.189 --> 02:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
it still technically would be a
 
02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
reportable hate crime in my opinion and
 
02:10:20.510 --> 02:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
definition based upon the bill but so I
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I might up that that
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
does clarify everything I just wanted to
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
make sure because excuse me just follow
 
02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:31.599 align:start position:0%
up and and so a race crime is typically
 
02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
the list that's in that is in the uh
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
enhanced penalty the the normal list
 
02:10:41.669 --> 02:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
that goes along with that correct thank
 
02:10:47.069 --> 02:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:08.430 --> 02:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
Murray um thank you for hearing my
 
02:11:13.229 --> 02:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
testimony uh my name is Grace Murray and
 
02:11:15.790 --> 02:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
I'm from Amhurst New Hampshire uh I'm
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of New Hampshire
 
02:11:18.589 --> 02:11:18.599 align:start position:0%
youth movement to ask ask that you
 
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
support hb1
 
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
1462 in my opinion we should be doing
 
02:11:26.350 --> 02:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
everything we can to stop hate crimes
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
and I think the very least we could be
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
doing is reporting them properly and in
 
02:11:31.629 --> 02:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
a way that can limit the amount that
 
02:11:31.639 --> 02:11:33.109 align:start position:0%
a way that can limit the amount that
they

02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
happen um I'm here to make uh just three
 
02:11:39.790 --> 02:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
brief points um so I'll keep it short um
 
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
number one I think people need to make
 
02:11:43.390 --> 02:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
informed decisions about where they're
 
02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
moving and where they're living and I
 
02:11:46.990 --> 02:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
think that this data is actually
 
02:11:49.390 --> 02:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
extremely important to that
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
um number two we need young people in
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
our state and this is an issue that is
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
important to young people and if we want
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
to keep young people in our state I
 
02:11:57.510 --> 02:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
think it's important we listen to the
 
02:11:59.709 --> 02:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
issues that they care
 
02:12:03.229 --> 02:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
about and number three we need data to
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
make good personal choices in good
 
02:12:07.870 --> 02:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and I think it's impossible
 
02:12:09.390 --> 02:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
for us to expect you as our state
 
02:12:11.229 --> 02:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
legislators to meet good legislation if
 
02:12:13.870 --> 02:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have the data um and if you
 
02:12:16.750 --> 02:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
don't have all the facts to support
 
02:12:19.950 --> 02:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
that by knowledging that hate crimes um
 
02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
by by acknowledging crimes motivated by
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
hatred of a certain people groups or
 
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
identities exist and by not reporting
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
them properly um it can feel like The
 
02:12:29.069 --> 02:12:29.079 align:start position:0%
Stance being taken is that this
 
02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
community doesn't need to be heard um or
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
that they don't matter supporting this
 
02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
legislation is a good first step in
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
rectifying that um thank you and I can
 
02:12:42.109 --> 02:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.430 --> 02:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
any see no questions thank you for your
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank
 
02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:48.709 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank
you

02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
Megan hello my name is Liam Manan I'm
 
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
currently a resident of conquered and
 
02:13:05.069 --> 02:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
I'm here speaking today as the general
 
02:13:06.669 --> 02:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
manager of a business that has been
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
targeted by hate crime activity numerous
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
times in the last 18 months and as a
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
queer transgender man who's lived in New
 
02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for my whole life um I'm sure
 
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
many of you have probably heard about
 
02:13:20.109 --> 02:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
the incident took place on Father's Day
 
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
in 2023 outside of T Toler if you
 
02:13:25.470 --> 02:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
haven't um I'll be brief a known hate
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
group neonazis from ns13 one targeted
 
02:13:30.030 --> 02:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
our shop because of drag Story Time
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
which we host once a month um they
 
02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
stormed the alley they were banging on
 
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
the Windows they were hailing Hitler the
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
whole thing um this not the only
 
02:13:40.189 --> 02:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
incident that has happened at my place
 
02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
of work in November the proud boys uh
 
02:13:45.549 --> 02:13:45.559 align:start position:0%
protested the first story hour we hosted
 
02:13:49.470 --> 02:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
at the new Cafe um in March of 2023 an
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
incendiary device was placed in the
 
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
planners outside of the shop and set off
 
02:13:56.589 --> 02:13:56.599 align:start position:0%
during a drag show in April of 203 a
 
02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
flyer circulated insinuating a summer of
 
02:14:00.910 --> 02:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
Vengeance against T Toler because we
 
02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
have storytime and drag shows for all
 
02:14:06.109 --> 02:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
ages and in December of 23 a few days
 
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
after the AG announced their
 
02:14:11.629 --> 02:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
investigation of the incident in June um
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
a couple of men got into the story time
 
02:14:16.229 --> 02:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
and were disruptive and we suspect they
 
02:14:18.510 --> 02:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
may be affiliated with what happened
 
02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
before um and just a few weeks ago at
 
02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
our first story of 2024 the same men
 
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
were actively outside um who had
 
02:14:30.990 --> 02:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
Disturbed the previous event so I'm sure
 
02:14:32.549 --> 02:14:32.559 align:start position:0%
that some of you have heard of the big
 
02:14:34.270 --> 02:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
ones but there are smaller things that
 
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
happen and so I think all of us here can
 
02:14:37.990 --> 02:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
agree on one thing whether we're
 
02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
straight queer cisgender transgender
 
02:14:44.069 --> 02:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
black Asian white immigrant citizen Etc
 
02:14:46.030 --> 02:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
we all want to live in a space that's
 
02:14:47.709 --> 02:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
safe and we don't have to fear violence
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
and we want a safe place for our
 
02:14:51.069 --> 02:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
children to grow up a safe place for our
 
02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
friends and family to gather and I think
 
02:14:55.310 --> 02:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
having a database like this that's more
 
02:14:57.950 --> 02:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public like uh Grace
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
was saying it's like to make informed
 
02:15:01.669 --> 02:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
decisions about where to move where to
 
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
work where to go and spend time um I
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
think that's really important and I
 
02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:08.119 align:start position:0%
think everybody living in New Hampshire
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
should should be able to have more
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
transparent information and versus just
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
a tally you know the way it is now most
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to understand you
 
02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
know we all just had to ask him a bunch
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
of questions to understand how the
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
current system works Al I think having a
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
slightly more broken down and easier
 
02:15:26.709 --> 02:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
thing to understand for the the lay
 
02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
person is essential um New Hampshire has
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
a hate problem and I believe that uh
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
this is a first step towards solving
 
02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
that problem and so please support this
 
02:15:41.549 --> 02:15:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:15:47.549 --> 02:15:47.559 align:start position:0%
scitec hav't they gotten tired you think
 
02:15:51.549 --> 02:15:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your
 
02:15:56.830 --> 02:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
testimony is there anyone else wishing
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
testify this bill was not done so seeing
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
none Clos public hearing with that I
 
02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on House Bill
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:16.719 --> 02:16:20.589 align:start position:0%
 
bill

02:16:20.589 --> 02:16:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:23.069 --> 02:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy members of the committee my
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
name is Le bney and I represent Grafton
 
02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
District 11 thank you for the
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce hb52 relative
 
02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
to alcohol rated offenses and
 
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
prohibitions this bill came about after
 
02:16:37.070 --> 02:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
the police chief in my town received
 
02:16:38.830 --> 02:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
complaints of beer cans regularly
 
02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
appearing on the side of the road in
 
02:16:42.990 --> 02:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
specific areas of town while
 
02:16:44.669 --> 02:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
investigating these incidents it was
 
02:16:46.190 --> 02:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
determined that the prevailing reason
 
02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
people litter in this way is to avoid
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
the open container law laws prohibiting
 
02:16:53.230 --> 02:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
open containers do not prevent people
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
from having alcohol in the vehicle but
 
02:16:56.990 --> 02:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
they do create a very strong incentive
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
to toss containers on the side of the
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
road to avoid enforcement and penalties
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
thus forming the impetus for this
 
02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
bill 10 other states have some form of
 
02:17:09.629 --> 02:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
allowance on open alcohol containers
 
02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
Alaska Arkansas Connecticut Delaware
 
02:17:15.309 --> 02:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
Louisiana Mississippi Missouri Virginia
 
02:17:18.429 --> 02:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
Tennessee and West Virginia one thing
 
02:17:20.110 --> 02:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
many of these states have in common with
 
02:17:21.790 --> 02:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that tourism is a major
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
component of their economy the argument
 
02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
on economic terms is simple allowing
 
02:17:28.110 --> 02:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
open alcohol containers and vehicles
 
02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
contributes to more alcohol consumption
 
02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
and therefore more
 
02:17:33.629 --> 02:17:33.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue while the original idea for the
 
02:17:36.349 --> 02:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
bill was just to repeal prohibition on
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
open containers we felt that a repeal
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
should include alternative tools for law
 
02:17:42.190 --> 02:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement to take drunk drivers off
 
02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:43.309 align:start position:0%
enforcement to take drunk drivers off
the

02:17:43.309 --> 02:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
road Parts one and two of the bill allow
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
police officer upon already establishing
 
02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable articulable suspicion that a
 
02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
driver of a vehicle may be under the
 
02:17:56.190 --> 02:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
influence to require the driver to
 
02:17:58.349 --> 02:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
submit to a horizontal gaze and stigmus
 
02:18:00.589 --> 02:18:00.599 align:start position:0%
test the result of which could then be
 
02:18:02.669 --> 02:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
used to establish probable cost for
 
02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:05.599 align:start position:0%
further action a horizontal gaze a
 
02:18:07.389 --> 02:18:07.399 align:start position:0%
stigmus test does not require the driver
 
02:18:09.669 --> 02:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
to exit the vehicle and is relatively
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
simple to perform performing the test
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
also provides more opportunities for the
 
02:18:16.349 --> 02:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
officer to interact with the driver and
 
02:18:18.589 --> 02:18:18.599 align:start position:0%
ascertain sobriety
 
02:18:20.990 --> 02:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
in summary open container prohibition
 
02:18:22.709 --> 02:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
creates an incentive to litter while
 
02:18:24.589 --> 02:18:24.599 align:start position:0%
removing the prohibition could have
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
positive economic impact on tourism and
 
02:18:29.549 --> 02:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
to combat negative effects of repealing
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
the prohibition this bill includes an
 
02:18:32.910 --> 02:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
extra tool for police to assess drivers
 
02:18:36.110 --> 02:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
that may be impaired I'm open to working
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
with the committee on any amendments to
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
particularly for parts one and two of
 
02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
the bill to reduce any possible Fourth
 
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment concerns but also part three
 
02:18:45.790 --> 02:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
if the committee feels some restriction
 
02:18:47.469 --> 02:18:47.479 align:start position:0%
should remain related to open container
 
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:18:56.349 --> 02:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm care what
 
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is kind of trying to
 
02:19:04.110 --> 02:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
guide Behavior right um if you're saying
 
02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
that people are more likely to throw uh
 
02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
their container out so that an officer
 
02:19:10.669 --> 02:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
does not see it because this law is this
 
02:19:13.150 --> 02:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
way we're trying to encourage behavior
 
02:19:16.270 --> 02:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
and I guess my question is wouldn't
 
02:19:18.910 --> 02:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
being pulled over over with an open
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
container in your car also encourage the
 
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
officer to detain you and uh and to to
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
be more likely um to go through that
 
02:19:31.230 --> 02:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
process of testing you and all that kind
 
02:19:33.549 --> 02:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
of stuff doesn't that kind
 
02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
of I'm just wondering about if we're
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
encouraging behavior wouldn't that also
 
02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
encourage people to want to throw the
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
container out because they don't want to
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
be tested in that way uh thank you for
 
02:19:44.830 --> 02:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
the question if I understand correctly
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
so uh an open container could be in the
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
back seat right it could be somebody in
 
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
the back seat that's drinking not
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily the driver so just kind of
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
going by you know first principles
 
02:19:56.590 --> 02:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
thinking if if the goal is to prevent a
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
drunk driver right that's that's the
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
whole reason for all of these laws is to
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
prevent a a driver behind the wheel of
 
02:20:05.790 --> 02:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
being drunk um then an open container
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
law is kind of aside you know you're
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
hoping that there's a correlation
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
between an open container in the vehicle
 
02:20:15.070 --> 02:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
or or disallow prohibiting open
 
02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
container would also prevent drunk
 
02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
drivers but it's not you know it's not
 
02:20:21.150 --> 02:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
one and the same right you can have an
 
02:20:22.750 --> 02:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
open container and it couldn't it could
 
02:20:24.030 --> 02:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
be somebody else drinking in the vehicle
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
the passenger in the back for example
 
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
and not the driver can I follow up
 
02:20:29.230 --> 02:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
quickly um thank you for that
 
02:20:31.309 --> 02:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
clarification um
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
um is the is the premise that someone
 
02:20:37.429 --> 02:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
would have a a half a bottle of wine in
 
02:20:40.349 --> 02:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
um a bag in their back seat and if they
 
02:20:42.429 --> 02:20:42.439 align:start position:0%
were um thinking that they were going to
 
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
be pulled over they would reach into the
 
02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
back of the car and throw that out and
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
that's the problem that that we're
 
02:20:50.190 --> 02:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
address uh so I mean that that's
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
certainly possible the specific issue
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
that we had in Grafton is that people
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
would well people would throw mostly
 
02:21:01.110 --> 02:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
empty containers right so they would be
 
02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
drinking a beer while you know in the
 
02:21:05.469 --> 02:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
vehicle and then they would just toss it
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
out so there wouldn't be anything in the
 
02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
you repr s thank you and thank you for
 
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm just looking up the details of
 
02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
how this test works because that was
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
something I was unfamiliar with it seems
 
02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
very similar to the test that is used
 
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
often to determine if people have the
 
02:21:32.110 --> 02:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
ability to track their Vision accurately
 
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of use of alcohol but just
 
02:21:36.429 --> 02:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
people who have Vision issues um is
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
there a way for someone uh to know
 
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's someone who's under the
 
02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
influence versus someone who simply has
 
02:21:46.349 --> 02:21:46.359 align:start position:0%
visual tracking problems based on what's
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
in here thank you thank you for that
 
02:21:50.469 --> 02:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
question so uh the police already do
 
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
that test the difference is uh they can
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
they have to ask the driver um and and
 
02:21:58.870 --> 02:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
the driver can refuse unless they had
 
02:22:00.990 --> 02:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
probable cause right unless they smell
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol or there's other obvious signs
 
02:22:05.309 --> 02:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
that they're they're impaired um this
 
02:22:07.389 --> 02:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
would allow them to do the same test
 
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
following the same procedure but uh with
 
02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
a lighter um it would be articulable
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
suspicion so for example you're driving
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
be a police driving behind somebody and
 
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
they're you know swerving on the road
 
02:22:18.910 --> 02:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
now the swerving could be because
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
they're playing on their phone or kids
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
are in the back or something like that
 
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
right not necessarily they're under the
 
02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
influence um so it it allows them but
 
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
they but they have a suspicion that
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
something's going on so it would allow
 
02:22:33.550 --> 02:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
them to to require to do that test as
 
02:22:35.309 --> 02:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to currently where you have to
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
have uh probable cause right they have
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
to either smell alcohol see somebody
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
um no further questions thank you thank
 
02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
this the chair recognizes Lieutenant
 
02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:24.510 align:start position:0%
this the chair recognizes Lieutenant
storm

02:23:24.510 --> 02:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my name is uh Lieutenant
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
Chris storm I am uh from the Department
 
02:23:30.429 --> 02:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
of Safety Division of State Police I am
 
02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
currently the highway safety liaison for
 
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
the State Police I am also the state's
 
02:23:35.070 --> 02:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
field sobriety coordinator for the whole
 
02:23:37.870 --> 02:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
state as far and I can uh answer uh
 
02:23:39.269 --> 02:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
representative celik's question that she
 
02:23:42.030 --> 02:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
had prior to that um first and foremost
 
02:23:43.550 --> 02:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
um the department of safety is opposing
 
02:23:45.389 --> 02:23:45.399 align:start position:0%
this bill and I I'll just read you some
 
02:23:47.269 --> 02:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
few notes that uh that I put down uh
 
02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
first of all we'd like to thank them for
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
um supporting law enforcement in uh
 
02:23:52.510 --> 02:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
trying to uh reduce the number of uh
 
02:23:55.469 --> 02:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
DWIs that we have on our our roadways uh
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
I would like to point out our concerns
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
with the potential implications of
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
suspending individuals um for just
 
02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
refusing horizontal gaze in stagos on uh
 
02:24:05.590 --> 02:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
the side of the road it's important to
 
02:24:07.550 --> 02:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
note that the refusal of hdn test alone
 
02:24:08.830 --> 02:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
should not be the sole reason for
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
suspending someone's license um there
 
02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
are various factors that should be taken
 
02:24:14.349 --> 02:24:14.359 align:start position:0%
into consideration when determining the
 
02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
administrative license suspension it's
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
essential for law enforcement to
 
02:24:19.990 --> 02:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
consider totality of the circumstances
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
and utilize a combination of tests and
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
observations to make it fair impartial
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
and accurate assessment of someone's
 
02:24:28.510 --> 02:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
impairment although hgn is an excellent
 
02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
um test for deterring um detecting
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
impairment it's also important for law
 
02:24:34.030 --> 02:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement to conduct all standardized
 
02:24:36.309 --> 02:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
field sobriety tests just conducting
 
02:24:38.110 --> 02:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
horizontal gaze and Status does not
 
02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
provide comprehensive assessment of that
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
particular individual's
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
impairment different individuals may
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
exhibit varying signs of impairment and
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
relying solely on one test may not
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
provide a complete picture of their
 
02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
condition by conducting multiple field
 
02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
sobriety test law enforcement can gather
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
accurate and reliable evidence to
 
02:24:57.269 --> 02:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
determine whether an individual is under
 
02:24:59.469 --> 02:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
the influence of alcohol or drugs this
 
02:25:00.990 --> 02:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
approach helps to ensure that law
 
02:25:02.590 --> 02:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement makes informed decision and
 
02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
help upholds fairness and accuracy in
 
02:25:06.830 --> 02:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
their assessments conducting all field
 
02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
sobriety test should also help minimize
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
the potential of Errors of that
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
particular law enforcement officer it is
 
02:25:14.429 --> 02:25:14.439 align:start position:0%
also very important to note that not all
 
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
drug categories cause hdn if law
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement doesn't do all the fields of
 
02:25:21.269 --> 02:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
bar is possible to miss that particular
 
02:25:23.070 --> 02:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
um individual that may be under the
 
02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
influence of
 
02:25:27.630 --> 02:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
drugs um this bill um makes it clear
 
02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
that um open container is also an
 
02:25:33.790 --> 02:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
allowable thing um we oppose that for uh
 
02:25:36.349 --> 02:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
numerous um reasons one we don't want um
 
02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
open alcohol containers with that that
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
that potential for any operator actually
 
02:25:42.269 --> 02:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
drink um alcohol while operating a
 
02:25:44.190 --> 02:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle that then may uh lead to
 
02:25:46.230 --> 02:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
impairment as uh as they travel down our
 
02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:48.190 align:start position:0%
impairment as uh as they travel down our
roadways

02:25:48.190 --> 02:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
roadways
 
02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
um this bill makes it clear um to take
 
02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
um impair that um representative takes
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
impaired driving um very seriously um
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
but we need to address the refusal of
 
02:25:58.990 --> 02:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
implied consent as a whole in New
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as we are one of the worst
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
states in the country as far as refusals
 
02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
go um there's currently a bill um Senate
 
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 418 that was within um the Senate
 
02:26:09.790 --> 02:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
um that should be coming over here to
 
02:26:11.550 --> 02:26:11.560 align:start position:0%
the house that addresses many of the
 
02:26:13.150 --> 02:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
issues that we're already very concerned
 
02:26:15.710 --> 02:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
about as far as the refusals go so we
 
02:26:17.630 --> 02:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
ask that um
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
you uh support that bill um I will take
 
02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
any questions as far as uh field
 
02:26:25.389 --> 02:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
sobriety as far as uh hgn goes or the
 
02:26:25.399 --> 02:26:26.309 align:start position:0%
sobriety as far as uh hgn goes or the
open

02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
open
 
02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
container thank you lieutenant currently
 
02:26:31.469 --> 02:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
if you refuse the breathalyzer your
 
02:26:33.309 --> 02:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
license is suspended is that correct
 
02:26:35.630 --> 02:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
that is correct sir but if you refuse
 
02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
the field sobriety there's no
 
02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
consequence that's a First Amendment
 
02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
issue is that correct so yes and no so
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
on the side of the road you are correct
 
02:26:44.190 --> 02:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
um there is no penalty for refusing
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
anything upon the side of the road but
 
02:26:47.790 --> 02:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
the implied consent in that informed
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
piece that we would have to then do on
 
02:26:51.309 --> 02:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
the side of the road also makes it very
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
complicated and very convoluted that we
 
02:26:55.150 --> 02:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
would have to inform somebody that they
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
are required to do this but then
 
02:26:58.030 --> 02:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
continue on with other standardized
 
02:27:00.030 --> 02:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
field sobriety tests on the roadway so
 
02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
that would be very confusing especially
 
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
if that individual is under the
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
influence of something would make it
 
02:27:08.389 --> 02:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
very confusing gotcha um with regard to
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
the horizontal gaze and nagas and
 
02:27:13.309 --> 02:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
frankly the other test as well is it not
 
02:27:14.830 --> 02:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
common practice to ask first do you have
 
02:27:16.110 --> 02:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
any medical conditions that would
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit you from um performing
 
02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
successfully on these tests yeah so New
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we actually have um a Supreme
 
02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
Court case called state to First the
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
hood and all police officers here in New
 
02:27:26.830 --> 02:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are trained under the
 
02:27:28.750 --> 02:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
standardized field sobriety testing um
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
battery which is conducted by the
 
02:27:31.790 --> 02:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
national highway traffic safety
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
administration and that Supreme Court
 
02:27:36.510 --> 02:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
law says that we need to inform people
 
02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
and do everything exactly the way that
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
we were trained on the side uh for those
 
02:27:42.670 --> 02:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
individuals on the side of the road so
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
the answer to your question is yes there
 
02:27:46.349 --> 02:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
is a medical um questioning that happens
 
02:27:48.030 --> 02:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
prior to administering standardized
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
field sobriety and lastly for me um I
 
02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
Heard the sponsor say that you could
 
02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
perform the horizontal Gaze on the
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
stagis test while the operator was
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
seated the vehicle is that that's
 
02:28:00.510 --> 02:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
correct um so that the head has to be
 
02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
aligned with the body to do that
 
02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
perfectly so it would be very difficult
 
02:28:05.389 --> 02:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
if that operator was turning to the left
 
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
and their head was not exactly in line
 
02:28:08.590 --> 02:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
with the body because you can actually
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
induce something called pan Which is
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
positional alcohol and the stagna so
 
02:28:14.269 --> 02:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
they could actually increase what that
 
02:28:15.710 --> 02:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
individual looks like or actually
 
02:28:17.070 --> 02:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
decrease what you're actually seeing
 
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
depending on the particular individual
 
02:28:20.349 --> 02:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
that would cause the accuracy of the
 
02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
test to be thrown out the window yes if
 
02:28:23.469 --> 02:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
their head is not in line with the body
 
02:28:25.710 --> 02:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
it absolutely is in accurate test thank
 
02:28:27.910 --> 02:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
you further questions for the lieutenant
 
02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative s it's perfectly legal
 
02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
for me to drink a Coke while I'm driving
 
02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
right certainly is why can't I have a
 
02:28:36.670 --> 02:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
Budweiser while I'm driving if I'm under
 
02:28:40.349 --> 02:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
008 and not impaired well if you're not
 
02:28:42.670 --> 02:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
impaired that's fine but the the the
 
02:28:46.110 --> 02:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
problem with drinking in driving is each
 
02:28:48.030 --> 02:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
individual metabolizes alcohol
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
differently right you could be
 
02:28:51.469 --> 02:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
increasing um as you continue to drink
 
02:28:53.590 --> 02:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
and as you go as time goes on while you
 
02:28:54.670 --> 02:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
have that open container you're
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
consuming alcohol your blood alcohol
 
02:28:58.389 --> 02:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
obviously the more you consume the
 
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:04.269 --> 02:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
up I would also answer that question
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
because I would say because we said so
 
02:29:10.070 --> 02:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
Representative no thank you Mr chair and
 
02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question just
 
02:29:13.950 --> 02:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
really quickly if if I were pulled over
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
and I had uh and my passenger had an
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
open Budweiser or something would you be
 
02:29:22.590 --> 02:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
more or less likely to test me uh and be
 
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
suspicious of me uh driving into the
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
influence so that's a great question so
 
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
twofold once obviously we'd smell the
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
odor of alcoholic beverage coming from
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
that vehicle right so it's very hard to
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
determine exactly who that particular um
 
02:29:36.990 --> 02:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
that particular odor is coming from so
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
we would have to do some work we'd have
 
02:29:39.990 --> 02:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
to ask some questioning and we'd have to
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
start by asking probably that individual
 
02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
step from the vehicle if they'd be
 
02:29:45.870 --> 02:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
willing to conduct field sobriety test
 
02:29:47.710 --> 02:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:29:49.269 --> 02:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant is open contained an
 
02:29:49.279 --> 02:29:50.469 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant is open contained an
arrestable

02:29:50.469 --> 02:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
arrestable
 
02:29:52.910 --> 02:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
offense so obviously everything's an
 
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
arrestable offense but nor normally we
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
would just uh issue that individual a
 
02:29:59.950 --> 02:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
citation okay so how often in your
 
02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
experience do you run across people with
 
02:30:04.269 --> 02:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
a bunch of empty beer cans all over the
 
02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
back seat floor um that does not result
 
02:30:10.590 --> 02:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
in an arrest is it quite often quite
 
02:30:11.950 --> 02:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
it's more normal that you don't arrest
 
02:30:14.269 --> 02:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
for that offense unless you have an oui
 
02:30:17.790 --> 02:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
with it is that yes sir thank you
 
02:30:19.750 --> 02:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you oh
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
did you
 
02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
have okay who did you point
 
02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
you sure absolutely
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
um any other people wishing to testify
 
02:30:39.630 --> 02:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
on this bill who have not testified on a
 
02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none I hereby close the
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 1
 
02:30:45.439 --> 02:30:47.750 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 1
152

02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
152
 
02:30:49.790 --> 02:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
and that concludes our business for
 
02:30:51.469 --> 02:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
today representative scitec wanted to
 
02:30:52.750 --> 02:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
say something I may address the
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
committee and the lieutenant in
 
02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
1991 uh I know the representative who
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
spoke against open container and he lost
 
02:31:03.269 --> 02:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
to Karen Wadsworth before she was a
 
02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
clerk she was a rep from Lebanon I up
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
that way not Lebanon anyway uh I made
 
02:31:13.630 --> 02:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
that point then I make it again it's I
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
want to support law enforcement but it
 
02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
just seems over the top I could be a
 
02:31:21.429 --> 02:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
passenger drinking my bud and you're
 
02:31:25.870 --> 02:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:28.590 --> 02:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
you did you just say that that you are
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
going to lose your re-election bit I'm
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:45.359 --> 02:35:38.710 align:start position:0%
 
said

02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:44.960 --> 02:36:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
out

02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:44.880 --> 02:39:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:19.269 --> 02:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
iiz um representative scitec to make a
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
motion I'm going to move that we that
 
02:39:25.309 --> 02:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
this bill be recommended as
 
02:39:29.269 --> 02:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
itl I'll second uh 1502 and seconded by
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative here GA would you like to
 
02:39:33.070 --> 02:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion representative site
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
yes uh what we heard uh was that this
 
02:39:40.830 --> 02:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
was ostensibly a litter uh protection uh
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill that's not the right word uh to
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
prevent litter from people who are
 
02:39:50.670 --> 02:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
avoiding the
 
02:39:54.830 --> 02:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
um open container prohibition we've in
 
02:39:57.150 --> 02:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
the testimony from the state police we
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
heard that uh there is a practical
 
02:40:02.429 --> 02:40:02.439 align:start position:0%
problem in administering this test
 
02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
because you have to have uh the proper
 
02:40:10.469 --> 02:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
alignment uh in order that the this uh I
 
02:40:13.469 --> 02:40:13.479 align:start position:0%
test I can't pronounce it at the moment
 
02:40:16.269 --> 02:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
uh be effective and accurate there are
 
02:40:19.389 --> 02:40:19.399 align:start position:0%
also constitutional problems in stopping
 
02:40:21.309 --> 02:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
somebody without
 
02:40:24.990 --> 02:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
in initiating this kind of test without
 
02:40:28.670 --> 02:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
probable cause and for that reason this
 
02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
bill would require uh may not even be
 
02:40:36.150 --> 02:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
may not even be able to be saved with an
 
02:40:38.670 --> 02:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
amendment uh the with respect to the
 
02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
open container portion of the bill it's
 
02:40:44.590 --> 02:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
really uh the the this is would be
 
02:40:46.429 --> 02:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
flogging a dead course it's already
 
02:40:49.790 --> 02:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
failed in our in my view our view I will
 
02:40:51.630 --> 02:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
hope in The committee's View on the
 
02:40:54.269 --> 02:40:54.279 align:start position:0%
grounds that I've just talked about so
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's my uh statement thank you
 
02:40:57.389 --> 02:40:57.399 align:start position:0%
representative gath would you like to
 
02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
speak to your second yes um I agree with
 
02:41:03.309 --> 02:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
everything that um the representative um
 
02:41:06.670 --> 02:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
produced um it says here that
 
02:41:09.190 --> 02:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
um what I liked about it was that he
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
said that this was not a complete
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
approach to the situation so um but he
 
02:41:17.110 --> 02:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
also mentioned that they have a bill
 
02:41:19.550 --> 02:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
that they would like us to look at um
 
02:41:21.349 --> 02:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's coming from the Senate that seems
 
02:41:22.790 --> 02:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
to be more
 
02:41:27.429 --> 02:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
complete 1418 thank you any further
 
02:41:29.630 --> 02:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
discussion being none I'd ask clerk to
 
02:41:30.830 --> 02:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
