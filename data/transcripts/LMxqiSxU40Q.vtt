bur thank you much for for that honor
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
um what I can say is about strategic
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuits against public
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
participation uh some people like them
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
some don't they uh address a specific
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
problem but they do close the door to
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
courtrooms uh in some respects uh I will
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
in the interest of full disclosure
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
indicate that I am a sponsor of a
 
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
different uh a co-sponsor of a different
 
00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
anti slap bill from representative
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
buroughs which I think is a better bill
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
it's more focused on a specific problem
 
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
uh my belief is this this bill is far
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
too General and therefore the balance of
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
good and harm uh shift and therefore I
 
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
would recommend
 
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
itl anyone else wish to be heard so the
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
only thing that I would say I I I think
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
I generally agree with what
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative bur said the the thing
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
that I felt when we had this bill a
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
is I think it's very unlikely that one
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
of these slap bills actually will
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
produce the The increased time to
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
resolution of a case that is that is
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
claimed because I think it would be the
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
rare case in which it's not really
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
disputed whether the the intent or
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
effect of the of the lawsuit was to
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
hinder First Amendment rights my
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
suspicion is in most cases there will be
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
a big fight about that there will have
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
to be Discovery and so it will take as
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
long as it would usually take the other
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
thing that concerned me about this uh
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
bill is that there is at least some
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
language in the bill that refers to that
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
uses the term prosecution which could
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
arguably mean that this bill and
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
the so-called
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
expedited um manner of of disposing of
 
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
cases could apply to criminal cases and
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
it's a very general proposition in the
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
criminal law as I'm sure representative
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
Burch knows that there aren't any
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
summary judgment motions in criminal
 
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
cases if a if an indictment is returned
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
the case goes to trial so for all those
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
reasons I I share representative bur's
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
view anyone else wish to be heard on
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
391 all right seeing none um I would ask
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the role the motion is
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%

I frankly I don't remember who but one I
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
got a message that one of the Reps who
 
00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:51.559 align:start position:0%
was interested in that uh would like to
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
be here if possible and can't be here
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
until two and what I told the person who
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
gave me that information is I would try
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to delay our proceedings
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
for this but if if I can accommodate her
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
by doing the other bills first I would
 
00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
uh I would do that so maybe she can be
 
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
here to hear what we have to say so I'm
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
going to skip 400 and go um to four uh
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%

warrants to be in the law and is uh one
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%

all right motion's been moved and
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
seconded representative mcf Farin would

you wish to like to speak to your motion
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
certainly uh in the spirit of keeping
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
things brief I will say that I think
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
that the information that is requested
 
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
here is warranted and appropriate and
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
will be useful for further legislation
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
as we heard from the the bill sponsor uh
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
and I hardly recommend the bill anyone
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard on
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
have I really want other people to do
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
this but
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
have no problem with providing
 
00:26:59.470 --> 00:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
information um and and I think we do a
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
good job of providing information um and
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
I don't remember if it's four or five
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
items and I think they're quite
 
00:27:11.389 --> 00:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable this list would require a lot
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
of items it require it will require
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
spending money which we don't like to do
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
to get the details uh that are required
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take into account the fact
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
that these are all matters that aren't
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
resolved within two or three months or
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
one year so that they come up again and
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
again and again and I think that um
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
there are better ways to spend um time
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
and money that would give us information
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
that could better inform our
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking than is required uh under
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you anyone else wish to
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative Oregan and
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
representative CH yes I mean they do the
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
AG does Express the opinion that he
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
thinks the federal the feds would pay
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
for the cost of it but I still think
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
it's I'm sorry could could you repeat
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
that rep I didn't quite hear you oh I
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
I'm also opposed to the OTP and the cost
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
um it's the cost is significant and the
 
00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
AG seems to think the feds would pay for
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
it but just given all the chaos in
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
Washington DC I think there's no
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they will pay for it and
 
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
even you know even they will pay for it
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's money that doesn't need to
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
be spent whether it's at a state or
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
federal level so it's an unnecessary
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
bill so I would uh so that's just one of
 
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
several reasons why I would not want to
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
vote for it right representative tur
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
yeah um I I also agree there there's
 
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
nothing sort of wrong with the content
 
00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:42.519 align:start position:0%
that's being requested but as as I
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
brought up in the the hearing the idea
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
that it's not a unique report of each
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
forfeiture is troubling because it does
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
sort of feel like the same uh activity
 
00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
could end up on multiple years of of
 
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
reporting and sort of uh exagger r or or
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
not allow us to duplicate the or UND
 
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
duplicate the the forfeitures that are
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
being that are being listed so I feel I
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
feel like something like it would be
 
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
good but this one maybe not anyone else
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
representative Burch thank you Mr chair
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
I I also am troubled a bit by it uh
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
because I don't think it's necessary we
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
already collect data we may collect data
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
on Five Points this will maybe add
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
another 15 points
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure the cost of the
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because we have to collect the
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
data as well as collated put it out and
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
distribute it so there are significant
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
costs uh and it may be unnecessary the
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
idea of collecting it because maybe at
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
some future use we might want to have it
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
at some future time but we'll soak to
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers now I think is is not the way
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
to go thank you anyone else wish to be
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
heard on 509 so I guess the the only
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
thing I would say and and um I was not
 
00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
at this hearing but um what
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
was my understanding is that no one from
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
the AG's office was here for the hearing
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
or at least if they were they didn't say
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
um you know this is going to be
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
unaffordable we can't do this is going
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
to be a huge problem and it's and since
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that would have to um
 
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
be in charge of getting this information
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
that that is I think the fact that they
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
didn't say that is pretty significant so
 
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
for those reasons I intend to support
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
the OTP motion any yes representative
 
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
Smith could just respond to that
 
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.149 align:start position:0%
Smith could just respond to that
um

00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
uh when the AG shows up here which they
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
do when they have to they are very clear
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
that they are not taking a position that
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
it is our job to set the policy and once
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
the policy is established they'll do
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
what they required to do so the fact
 
00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
that they didn't come and say
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
um you know that they had problems with
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
this I don't think is um I think the
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
word would be causitive in terms of
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
having us decide it's rare that we get
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
something from the AG or from any
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
Department that says definitively that
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
they support or oppose a bill well I I I
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
guess I would say respon I I agree with
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
you to this extent I think it is true
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
that they rarely say take a position I
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
you know support or oppose but what they
 
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
often do do and in fact um I mean the
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
most recent example that comes to mind
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh is the hearing we had um last week on
 
00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.470 align:start position:0%
uh is the hearing we had um last week on
uh

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
HB uh 195 and
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
522 they where somebody came and said
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
you know these here are some problems we
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
have with the wording and you should
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
change this or you should change that so
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is I think what the AG's
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
office will do even if they don't take a
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
position on the bill if they see that
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
there's you know something is going to
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
cost a lot of money or there needs to be
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
additional resources or something like
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
that I my my experience has been that
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
they usually will say that kind of thing
 
00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
and again I was not at the hearing but
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that they did not
 
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
say that at the hearing in this case
 
00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
representative mcfar uh thank you Mr
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah I I believe you're correct
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
and on top of that uh my recollection of
 
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
the hearings that transpired that day
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
was that we had a number of law
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials here to speak
 
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
about not just that bill but related
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
bills and the topic of the information
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
around forfeitures came up and it was
 
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
clear from the responses that however
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
they may have felt on the bills they
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
felt that they had the information at
 
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.269 align:start position:0%
felt that they had the information at
their

00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
fingertips anyone else yes
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you Mr chair
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
um I would also oppose OTP on this um
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
one of the problem problems I see is
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
that the bill provides that the uh
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
attorney general would report 120 days
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
after the close of the fiscal year um
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
and that might CA take a case that uh is
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
proceeding over two fiscal years and
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
split the data about one particular case
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
between two fiscal years which seems to
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
me to defeat sort of to defeat the the
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of this um I mean it's very
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
possible that one case is going to
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
extend over uh more than one fiscal year
 
00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:33.559 align:start position:0%
and then you end up with bifurcation of
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
the data and I don't I don't think from
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
a practical point of view that this
 
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
works very well thank you anyone else
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
officers of the Department of Education
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
to issue subpoenas and uh the chair
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative kutab for a
 
00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:27.079 align:start position:0%

made and seconded representative kutab
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
motion I think
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
we've discussed this bill extensively
 
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
both last year and this year and I did
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
go through and I saw that there were
 
00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.630 align:start position:0%
go through and I saw that there were
multiple

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
other departments which had allowed for
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
their either commissioner commission or
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
board to all issue uh subpoenas and the
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
doe the doe commissioner was essentially
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
kind of the only one who didn't have it
 
00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:08.839 align:start position:0%
there were 10 other Commissioners who
 
00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:11.079 align:start position:0%
all have it including the lottery
 
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner the revenue commissioner
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
the insurance commissioner the Labor
 
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.390 align:start position:0%
the insurance commissioner the Labor
Commissioner

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioner
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
um It Go the L Dees the list goes on and
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
then there's several boards councils and
 
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
commissions including the Liquor
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
Commission and the executive branch
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
um so I just I think it's really
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
important that we make sure
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
that our commissioners have the tools
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
that they need need to get their job
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
done thank you anyone else wish to be
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
heard on HB
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
520 represent I'm sorry
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
got representative bur thank you um I'm
 
00:37:00.309 --> 00:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to the OTP on on this um for a
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
host of reasons
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
probably I hate to relativ them but
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
certainly one of the more important
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
reasons is the doe came in and said
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
we've been able to get all the
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
information we want
 
00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
already without this uh in-house
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
expansion of power so if there isn't a
 
00:37:28.109 --> 00:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
problem why are we working on a solution
 
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh secondly we know that the attorney
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
general has the authority already to do
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill does and in essence this
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
is I don't know whether it's a power
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
grab or a Turf issue or whatever but it
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
seems as if the Department of Education
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
wants to run the show Itself by having
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
its own hearing examiner its own
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
prosecution so to speak of the case its
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
own subpoena power at the invest vatory
 
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
stage where the person being
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
investigated has no equivalent power to
 
00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:08.839 align:start position:0%
compel evidence and witness uh Witnesses
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
for themselves so it's an unbalanced
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
proceeding it's an unnecessary
 
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
proceeding and um for those and probably
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
other reasons uh I urge the OTP to be
 
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
defeated right any uh representative
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
Smith um thank you I want wonder if um
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh someone um supporting the leg
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
legislation would help me better
 
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
understand um the connection between the
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill and the
 
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
testimony um the uh the bill says that
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
the subpoena um has to do with the
 
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
violation or possible violation of the
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
educator code of conduct
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
by a certified
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
educator um the uh code has to do with
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
child safety it has nothing to do with
 
00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum and yet the
 
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
examples that have been given by people
 
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.990 align:start position:0%
examples that have been given by people
who

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
support um
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh this bill all had to do with
 
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.069 align:start position:0%
uh this bill all had to do with
curriculum

00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:33.079 align:start position:0%
and um I I think that this is an attempt
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
to either have a sheep in Wolf's
 
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
clothing or a wolf in sheep's clothing
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which but whatever it is I
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
don't think it is
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
um uh I don't think that the language of
 
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
the bill uh specifically
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
supports the arguments that have been
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
presented to us in favor of the bill
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard yes
 
00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.030 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard yes
representative

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
CA I'd like to also mention that every
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
other New England State they all have
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
this power um and so I really just don't
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
think that it's unreasonable for them to
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
have it the even in Connecticut Rhode
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
Island Maine Massachusetts and Vermont
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you anyone else wish to be
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
heard representative
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
ter uh I don't know if this would be the
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate time to offer an amendment
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
um I think I think we probably ought to
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
vote first on the OTP and then consider
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment well well no because
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
because I I think technically speaking
 
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
if you were to do that Mr chairman once
 
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
the OT passes that's it it's no okay
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right there was to be
 
00:40:47.319 --> 00:40:49.349 align:start position:0%
okay all right there was to be
consideration

00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay all right no that's okay
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
it would have to be now all right so no
 
00:40:59.309 --> 00:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
that's fine so representative tur uh do
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
you I turn the floor to you what do you
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
want to do did did you have a comment
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
before I would it be okay if I just
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
added a brief additional comment to my
 
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
comments of course of course thank you
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I appreciate the the leniency
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
on that I didn't want to forget the
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
concern I had that there's no protection
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
for Student Records in this
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'm concerned also about
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill would create an ability
 
00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:29.079 align:start position:0%
to pea
 
00:41:32.589 --> 00:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
children all right thank you all right
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
um all right so representative tur uh
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
yes so I i' I'd like to offer Amendment
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh 0842 H uh to House Bill 520 and I'll
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
speak to it is there a second for
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
that all right so um motion is um made
 
00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
second all right uh yes representative
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
CH go ahead yeah thank you Mr chair so
 
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh let me summarize the amendment first
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
which is basically what it does is it
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
takes the um subpoena power as
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
originally written going to the hearing
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
officer and replaces it with the
 
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
um we heard in our testimony that that
 
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
is done by a range of state agencies the
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
amendment was
 
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
drafted um based on a uh uh RSA
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
17041 part two um which pertains to um
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh child daycare residential care and
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
child placing agency so this is very
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
consistent with the IDE aidea of
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh hearings regarding uh standing lure
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
certification Etc which some of the
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
other agencies that we we just heard
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
about don't um don't get involved with
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's a couple of reasons why I'm
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
offering this uh building on I guess
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
what what representative Burch had
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned one um we have heard that
 
00:43:24.549 --> 00:43:24.559 align:start position:0%
there's no uh there has not been a need
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
for this in the past so the idea of
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
creating a completely different
 
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
structure for hearing these um I don't
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
think is really warranted when we have
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
when we can simply allow um and this was
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
the testimony I Believe by the
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Education they're not
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to approach the AG for a
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
subpoena if we allowed that um than it
 
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
could be done through that standard
 
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
process without setting up another um
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
system the other thing that I think is
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
really almost more important and I think
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
is a sort of a structural problem with
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
the bill if it doesn't go this way is
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh the entire process refers back to
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
folks within the doe the hearing
 
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
officers work under the direction of the
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner of of the Department of
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
Education so the provisions that say
 
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
that you could make a motion to quash
 
00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:17.559 align:start position:0%
The subpoena or challenge The subpoena
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
and the even the very idea that the that
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
the um the subpoena is Justified would
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
all be heard by somebody who works under
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
the the direction of the person making
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
the subpoena and I think that's really I
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
I can't see how you get around that
 
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Education this
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
I think offers us a a solution that that
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
provides everything that that was
 
00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:45.559 align:start position:0%
originally requested so everything you
 
00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:47.319 align:start position:0%
know there there there would be no if it
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
was a good faith subpoena request the AG
 
00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:52.599 align:start position:0%
would have the power to do it and it
 
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
would provide all the access that the
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
department needs but without sort of
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
making it a a wholly contained function
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
of the department um of education so um
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
and and as you'll see the language of
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
the of the bill stays largely the same
 
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
it just largely replaces the concept of
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General with uh or the
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
concept of the hearings officer with the
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general all the other
 
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
protections and everything that were in
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
the original Bill are are still in place
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
so uh I don't see this as being
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
radically different in terms of effect
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
from what was proposed but I think it's
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
radically different in terms of uh
 
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
operational um implementation and
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
fairness so I'll stop there all right
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on the
 
00:45:45.549 --> 00:45:45.559 align:start position:0%
amendment so I guess what I would say um
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
with regard to uh the amendment is first
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
with respect to the issue of you know
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
the hearings officer works for the for
 
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
the commissioner I mean what you raise
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
representative ter sort of a fundamental
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
issue that has been litigated by the
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
courts for decades now in in the
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
administrative law context there's
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
always been that argument well the
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
hearings officer in this agency or that
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
agency is is responsible to the to the
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
boss of the agency how can they possibly
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know that's a some kind of a due
 
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
process violation they can't be fair uh
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
the courts have pretty uniformally
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
rejected that idea in the administrative
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
law context and there's no reason um for
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
treating it um uh differently here um
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would say with um and
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
Mr this maybe goes to both the um the
 
00:46:40.549 --> 00:46:40.559 align:start position:0%
amendment and the the the basic bill is
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
to the extent representative Smith you
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
were saying you know there's no sort of
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
no need for this if I recall correctly
 
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
even at the last hearing we had on 520 I
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
think that there was some evidence
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there was at least one
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
case in which the department wanted
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
records and yes they eventually got them
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
but they had to the the school district
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
or administrative unit whatever wouldn't
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
released they wouldn't turn them over
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
they had to go down there and look at
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
them and they couldn't copy them um it
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
seems to me that that's an that's an uh
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
you know one at least one example of a
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
situation where um the to me the
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
fundamental concept is if you are a
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
regulatory agency and you're entitled to
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
conduct enforc or disciplinary
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
proceedings you ought to have the
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
ability to compel someone to provide the
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
information so that they can't say go
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
pound sand in one form or another
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
whether the go pound sand is we're not
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
giving them to you at all or you can
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
come down here and look at them but
 
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
we're not going to let you them you copy
 
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
them why because the Department of
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
Education is we can't trust them is that
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
is that the theory about why they
 
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be able to look at the look at
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
the uh look at the record I I'm sorry I
 
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
just reject that um so for those reasons
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
I plan to vote against this proposed
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
amendment but for the underlying Bill
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard can I can I
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
just clarify yeah that I I I I think
 
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
again speaking to the amendment um you
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
know it's I I don't know if you have any
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
comments I feel like it's still
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
preserves the ability to compel someone
 
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:25.640 align:start position:0%
it almost is more seems to me to have
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
more weight of it's coming through
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
through an attorney general's office
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
than through a hearing officer within
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
Education all right um so I guess the
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
vote first will be on
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment um
 
00:48:44.349 --> 00:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
0842 whether to adopt that Amendment and
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
since it seems like we have a
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
controversy about it I'm going to do
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
that by roll call vote so I would ask
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
the clerk to uh call the role on the
 
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.230 align:start position:0%
the clerk to uh call the role on the
amendment

amendment thank you Mr chairman uh yes

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment should be in front of
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:47.510 align:start position:0%

00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
the essence of Representative tour's uh
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
earlier Amendment as well as a number of
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
other changes that I thought to be
 
00:52:59.069 --> 00:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
warranted and I'll just clarify them
 
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
because I see that OS has not you know
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
marked them in bold they've just kind of
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
replaced the whole language uh so the
 
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
changes that are embodied in this
 
00:53:09.309 --> 00:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
amendment include as I said
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative T is one uh that you've
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
already seen and also uh in uh one uh in
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
section one where it changes and adds
 
00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
the subp paragraph n um I have added the
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
words who is a party to a conversation
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
or who has the prior EXP explicit
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
consent of such a party uh so that the
 
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh the the statute if passed would
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
reflect that this is applicable only to
 
00:53:37.789 --> 00:53:37.799 align:start position:0%
parties to the
 
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
conversation uh or their agreed designes
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
and not a a third party with with no
 
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
consent which is the way that it read
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
previously um the next change I've made
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
is I've added the the words intended to
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
be in uh subclause one and I've added
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
the words anticipates or in sub Clause 2
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh so those are the changes and I hope
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
that they are apart from that uh party
 
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh item that they are
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory right all right so I um
 
00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
Manos oh your mic yeah sorry I'm sorry
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to just ask from
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
clarification from representative
 
00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.630 align:start position:0%
clarification from representative
McFarland

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
McFarland
 
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
um you spoke about your last two changes
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
and I I wasn't able to pick up where
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
they were you said sure So in in number
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
one it says is intended to be provided
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
because I think um at the time that the
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
recording is
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
made it could not be provided to the law
 
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency at that time I I I
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
mean I I suppose one could dream up some
 
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
sort of live streaming scenario but I
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
think that's unlikely um so the the
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
intent seems to be the important aspect
 
00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
there and then in number two um I think
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
that it is entirely plausible that
 
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
somebody might seek to record events
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
with the expectation that there's a a
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
crime uh going to occur um but they then
 
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
might be uh wrong and they might simply
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
delete the recording and I don't think
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
that that should be uh you know creating
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
a a crime
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
because they thought something bad was
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
going to happen and then it
 
00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
didn't thank you other yes
 
00:55:33.079 --> 00:55:34.470 align:start position:0%
didn't thank you other yes
representative

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
tur uh yeah thank you Mr chair so um I I
 
00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
I support uh both representative
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
McFarland's changes and I just wanted to
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
clarify the the the component that I uh
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
and again ignore the separate amendment
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you that I had
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
that I had drafted I wasn't sure if this
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
was going to come or not so um it's my
 
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
content is in here and all I did was add
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
um on line essentially line nine um and
 
00:56:03.069 --> 00:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
is not publicly disclosed or released by
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
the person or their agent the reason I
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
added that I think the the testimony
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
around this entire piece of uh law is
 
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
that it's quite outdated it's been
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
around for a long time it predates
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
the the a lot of the the ways in which
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
recordings and such are used in the
 
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
modern in the modern context um and
 
00:56:28.029 --> 00:56:28.039 align:start position:0%
there no attempts to change the
 
00:56:32.109 --> 00:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
underlying process but um The Way It Was
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
Written it would essentially say if
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
you've um provided it to law enforcement
 
00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
there were no other restrictions on what
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
you could do with it and I think for me
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
the intent was not to open the door to
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
you know giving it to law enforcement
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
then posting it on Facebook or or trying
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
to you know hear your case in in the
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
court of public opinion so I feel like
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh that ex that exclusion puts it back
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
within the context of of why in this
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
unique situation single party recording
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
allowed right yes representative Manos
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I think that um
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative mcfarling and uh
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
representative tours uh changes are well
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
meant here but I read line nine as in
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
the disjunctive with the ores and so I
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
took this to mean that the recording is
 
00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:30.039 align:start position:0%
not released by the person and to me
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
that meant for example if the victim
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
released the recording to their Pastor
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
or to their therapist or to a DV
 
00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:44.039 align:start position:0%
counselor that um that that would not be
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
permitted under this amendment and I
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
have concern about that
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
um I have concern about that thank you
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
so I would oppose the amendment yes
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative um so I I it looked like
 
00:57:58.990 --> 00:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman you might have been about
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
to speak there so I defer to you on on
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
the interpretation but I would say that
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
I think the intent is that the word
 
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
publicly uh is relevant here right that
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
that would be my interpretation too is
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
that that would not that that kind of
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
disclosure to a counselor or something
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
like that would not be considered a
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
public disclosure um and and just just
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
to add on during the hearing the word
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
the word solely came up as a possible
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
way to amend the language and I
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
specifically didn't go with that to
 
00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
allow for those type of disclosures but
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
not public disclosure because solely
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
would have limited that can I just add
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
to that yes representative man so I I
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
think I see the confusion reading it as
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
public publicly disclosed or released
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
rather than publicly disclosed or
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
released which is which is I think what
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
is if that clarifies
 
00:58:51.559 --> 00:58:53.510 align:start position:0%
is if that clarifies
problem

00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps so I you know I guess I would
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
say is um oh I'm sorry representative uh
 
00:58:58.559 --> 00:58:59.829 align:start position:0%
say is um oh I'm sorry representative uh
Burch

00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
Burch
 
00:59:04.109 --> 00:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
goad yeah so I'm kind of puzzled about
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
how both of these sections work uh or
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
subsections work so my first question is
 
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.750 align:start position:0%
subsections work so my first question is
is

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
intended to be provided to a law
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency or utilized in a
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
certain way um that intent presumably
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
does not have to be carried out it's
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
only an intent is that right
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
I respond yes of course uh so I believe
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
that is correct representative bur in
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
the example I gave earlier uh if and I
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
think one of the examples that we've
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
heard from the sponsors that they are
 
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
focused on in the reason they brought
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
this bill forward uh centers around
 
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and if we contemplate
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh domestic violence hypothesis where uh
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
there is a pattern of Behavior Uh there
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:59:58.109 --> 00:59:58.119 align:start position:0%
uh recording that
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
is set to take place of what is expected
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
to be a continuation of that pattern and
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
then that continuation does not occur in
 
01:00:09.069 --> 01:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
that instance well there would be
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
nothing in that recording that would be
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
warranting providing it to law
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency or so forth so I I I
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
think that's what I'm going with it but
 
01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm misinterpreting your
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
question all right to to go further
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
because still puzzled on that uh who is
 
01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
encompassed this is a bit from
 
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
representative Manos by or their agent
 
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.870 align:start position:0%
representative Manos by or their agent
so

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
if I I if
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
a just going to use gender wrong
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
language if a guy's calling up his
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
ex and the ex records the conversation
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
and believes there's something bad on it
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh of of this nature and they turn it
 
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
over to the
 
01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.069 align:start position:0%
over to the
um

01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
Coalition Coalition is considered their
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
agent sorry who's the Coalition oh the
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire Coalition against
 
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual yes okay are they
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
now an agent of the uh purported victim
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
or are they an independent yeah I mean I
 
01:01:21.549 --> 01:01:21.559 align:start position:0%
I think my response to that would be
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
that um I'm not going to speak for the
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill Bill and for the
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
purpose of the underlying bill I merely
 
01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:31.039 align:start position:0%
saw this as a change that improved the
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
language of the bill now you may have
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
your own opinion as to whether the bill
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
is warranted and whether it's
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate to talk to council talk to
 
01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:43.039 align:start position:0%
the Coalition you the language or their
 
01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:45.319 align:start position:0%
that's represent that's what I was say
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
that's my language so I I can answer
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
that a little bit um the the intent and
 
01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:52.039 align:start position:0%
you may or may not disagree that it
 
01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
captures it but I tried to be very
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
specific about the way this was worded
 
01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
by saying their agent it meant that they
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
are not giving it to someone else for
 
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of public disclosure so if
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
they gave it to you know their Council
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
and you know if if if they didn't intend
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
through their aid directly or through
 
01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
their agent to have it publicly released
 
01:02:16.829 --> 01:02:16.839 align:start position:0%
you know there's once something's out in
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
the world it's hard to limit what's
 
01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:22.039 align:start position:0%
going to happen to it um I think to the
 
01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
extent possible hopefully the intent in
 
01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:26.839 align:start position:0%
the language makes it clear this should
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
not be publicly released but you know
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
with without sort of limiting what the
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
person who made the recording can do
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
with it to further their court case but
 
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
still making it clear that they can't
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
release it and they can't authorize
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
someone else to release it was the
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
intent could I just clarify the the
 
01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
agent question a little if if because
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about an attorney who
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
has obligations to keep things
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
confidential that between her and her
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
client unless otherwise agreed I'm
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
talking turning it over to an agency
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
such as the Coalition uh would that be
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
would would that run a foul of this
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
amendment wouldn't the wouldn't the
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
circum wouldn't it depend on the
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances in other words if
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
the it would seem to me that that might
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
be something it would depend on the
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
particular circumstances of the cas I
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
could I don't know exactly how the
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
Coalition operates but if they were
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
providing you know if they were going to
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
be the agent some kind of a counselor
 
01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:36.039 align:start position:0%
sort of similar maybe not in terms of
 
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
providing legal expertise but in terms
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
of their obligations to the client
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
similar to a lawyer then I would say
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
that that they probably would be an
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
agent if they were if you know if they
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
were just if the uh I mean if for if for
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
example the the the person who made the
 
01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
recording um understood that the the
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
council was going to issue a press
 
01:04:02.269 --> 01:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
release based on this recording once
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
they got it then I would say that if the
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
if the person turned it over to the to
 
01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
the Coalition they would be violating
 
01:04:13.269 --> 01:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
this provision um so that's what I mean
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
that I I read the word agent to mean
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
you're somebody that's acting in the
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
interest of the person who turned it
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
over but they okay if I could just
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
follow up on the word anticipates
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
because because I think we've covered
 
01:04:27.599 --> 01:04:30.029 align:start position:0%
because because I think we've covered
agent

01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
agent
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
enough um I don't know who to direct the
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
qu oh all right
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
so I I am
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
a yeah so I am a um putative victim of
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
domestic assault the other the other
 
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
person has a history of calling me and
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
and on some call
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
is abusive and some calls
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
not and I pick up my phone and that name
 
01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:03.910 align:start position:0%
not and I pick up my phone and that name
is

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
there um under
 
01:05:07.359 --> 01:05:09.990 align:start position:0%
there um under
this

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
amendment there really isn't any reason
 
01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
to to Bar me from tape recording every
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
one of the messages from that person is
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
that right or calls so I'll answer that
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
in two parts I think first of all the
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
notion that
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
um there can be something which would
 
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
rise to the level of of law enforcement
 
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
action on a phone call um maybe I'm not
 
01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
familiar enough with the law but that
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
seems to be absurd in the example you're
 
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
raising and I I would not um be uh
 
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
expecting this to be used to claim abuse
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
over a phone call I would expect however
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
that if you had given me a similar
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
example in person in a room uh where
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
there's a history of uh somebody beating
 
01:05:59.789 --> 01:05:59.799 align:start position:0%
their partner let's say um and that
 
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen on that one occasion now
 
01:06:03.069 --> 01:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
you say to me well would that give you a
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
right to be recording on a continuous
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
basis um I think the question at hand is
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
what is what is done with the recording
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
and whether what is done with the
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
recording meets the the letter of the
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
statute as it would exist with this in
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
in in place and so it comes back to the
 
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
question of how you're using I think um
 
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
if you look at the uh uh what is it RSA
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
570a right there's a whole bunch of
 
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
exceptions in there of which this would
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
just become another
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
exception all right um anyone else have
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
any anything further to say on this so I
 
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
guess I I think personally I think this
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
is an important uh uh bill because it
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
offers the protections that
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland and
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative tur pointed out I think
 
01:06:58.029 --> 01:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
it is it seems to me that the wording is
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
you know is appropriate could there be C
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
circumstances where that have to be a
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
court would have to construe it sure but
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
I think it's it sounds to me to be
 
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
pretty clear language the other thing I
 
01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:10.119 align:start position:0%
would point out and I really I
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland pointed this
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
out to me last night at our uh at our
 
01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
caucus on this on on a number of bills
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
and I it was really an excellent catch
 
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
because I I think probably in relying on
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
the the the title of the bill which
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
talks about one one party uh consent I
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
had been assuming that this amendment
 
01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:32.839 align:start position:0%
dealt with one party consent but as he
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
quite properly pointed out it didn't
 
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
have that language in it and so if we
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
had passed it without that provision I
 
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
mean at least arguably it would have
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
allowed any non-law enforcement officer
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
to in effect conduct a wir tap where
 
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
nobody was consenting and the person was
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
um and this person was just recording
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
conversations so I think it's a it was a
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
very good catch representative McFarland
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh in some I think this is a good uh
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
bill and I intend to support the otpa
 
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
with representative McFarland's
 
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment anyone else uh have anything
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
they want to say yes yes sir so I just
 
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch real quick somebody had
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned um therapists chaplain vet
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
reps Etc uh those people are already
 
01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
sworn to privacy unless there is
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable um like very reasonable need
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
to turn it over to law enforcement only
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
and violating that privacy is covered
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
under law and under social contract and
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
under medical contract and a clergy
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
contract so talking to an entrusted
 
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
person in that capacity is already
 
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
protected under law and that's not a
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
risk in this bill all right anyone else
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
have any comment so I'm I may be wrong
 
01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:51.799 align:start position:0%
but it sounded to me like there was
 
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
generally a consensus on the amendment
 
01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
so does anybody object if why we if we
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment by a show of hands
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
if anybody does I'll do it by roll
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
call all right so then on amendment
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
0843 can I ask all those who are in
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:19.550 align:start position:0%
 
hand

01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
so 16 all right 16 and those opposed
 
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
amendment all right then on the uh bill
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
as amended um so it would be otpa on 587
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
with Amendment
 
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
0843 anybody else want to have any
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
comment they want to
 
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
make seeing none I would ask the clerk
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%

01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
motion the
 
01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.629 align:start position:0%
motion the
way

01:12:49.629 --> 01:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
people get to yes the way they reach a
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
compromise the way they balance
 
01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.229 align:start position:0%
compromise the way they balance
competing

01:12:59.229 --> 01:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
competing
 
01:12:59.239 --> 01:13:00.790 align:start position:0%
competing
demands

01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
demands
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
um uh has a mix of both private and
 
01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.830 align:start position:0%
um uh has a mix of both private and
public

01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um when we're um
 
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with a public body
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
um I believe that
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
um we can end up with a much
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
better result
 
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
if we recognize that certain parties in
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
negotiations can negotiate among
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
themselves um in a more effective way
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
privately and each of the groups of
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
course can negotiate among itself as
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
they try to reach a
 
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
resolution um I don't believe that the
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
public interest is really gained by um
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
adoption of this particular
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
legislation anyone representative
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
organ well yes well this applies only to
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
the the management side of the labor
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
contracts because a union uh a union
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
local is not a government body and um
 
01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
they're and so they're you know they
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
appropriately would discuss have their
 
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
discussions um about the contract with
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
themselves and it's probably
 
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
um a bad idea to force the uh you know
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
the negotiating committee on the other
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
side and the government side of it to uh
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
be unable to negotiate in private
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
because uh talk amongst themselves in
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
private because
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
um well I guess because I think what we
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
want to do is get to yes and reach a
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
consensus about a contract which both
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
sides like and so the uh the management
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
side would would be uh impeded in
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
getting you know in getting to a
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
contract which you know the uh which
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
their counterparts on the union side
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
would like and I think there is a there
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
this seem to be a feeling somehow that
 
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
if we did this the public you know the
 
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
public management negotiat would be
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
really really tough you know they
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make any concessions and that's
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's not necessar a good thing that
 
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
they're being really really tough and I
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't even know if that would be the
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
case they might actually most cases the
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
public is probably pretty pretty
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the uh public workers who
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
are trying to get a contract they might
 
01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
actually be easier on but anyway it's
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
easier to for them easier both sides to
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
be negotiate have the same um you know
 
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
be able to negotiate have the same
 
01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
rights to to you know speak amongst
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
themselves before they uh before they
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
agree to anything and um also of course
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
this could in any case be circumvented
 
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
by bringing a third party so if you had
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
like If you hired some lawyers that ever
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
to negotiate on your behalf they
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a public body so they would
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
be able to like uh discuss it but that
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
just kind of comp cases the
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking process I've probably
 
01:15:59.950 --> 01:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
gone on too long but anyway this is a
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
this is this is not a good bill we've
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
killed it before and we should kill it
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
again this year thanks anyone else wish
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
to be heard on uh
 
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
hb400 yes representative trip I agree
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
with representative
 
01:16:19.229 --> 01:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
Horgan anyone else wish to be heard um
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I would say
 
01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
is I have mixed feelings about this on
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
the one hand I I I sort of agree with
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
the idea that why shouldn't this be
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
public but I'm I'm concerned about the
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and the
 
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
implications of um what what a
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
negotiation in public could could end up
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
looking like and would there be you know
 
01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
would these become sort of political
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
events where the uh the troops so to
 
01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
speak from both sides show up to uh to
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
the to the negotiations uh so on on
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
balance I I I will support the itl
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
motion anyone else um have anything they
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
wish to say yes representative
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
Perez thank
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
you I understand what you're saying but
 
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
I think both sides at this point are so
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about their taxes
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
and what their money is being spent on
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
that everyone has a right to the
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
transparency of different things that
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
are being negotiated right
 
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative Anderson then
 
01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:37.629 align:start position:0%
representative Anderson then
representative

01:17:37.629 --> 01:17:37.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
man thank you Mr chair I understand both
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
sides of the
 
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
equation but something has to and I will
 
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
vote to itl but something has to
 
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
change last week I went to a school
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
meeting one of the warrant articles was
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
wages but none of us know what's in that
 
01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
contract until after the fact and I
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
think it's sad that something I think
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
they could have negotiations on Zoom you
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
I mean you don't have to let the public
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
you know be in you know interact with it
 
01:18:23.229 --> 01:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
but they could know what's going on
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you represent man yeah to to
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
answer those
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
questions the only thing that the town
 
01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
is voting on is the money being
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
allocated and that's and you have an
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity during deliberative session
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
or town meeting to do just that the
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
inner workings of the contract vacation
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
days grievance procedures promotion
 
01:18:46.669 --> 01:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
procedures to have that be public and
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
open would just would be impossible to
 
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
negotiate a contract that way your
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on the money being
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
allocated is there it's during your
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
deliberative session or your town
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
meeting so thank you all right anyone
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard on um on HB uh 400

having sat on both sides of the table
 
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
when contracts were negotiated I have
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
found that you actually are able to um
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
achieve a better contract for your town
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
when you don't have all of the noise of
 
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
the people who are listening in around
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
you you actually are able to accomplish
 
01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
more for your constituents when you can
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh bargain in a calm um and respectful
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
and um way that keeps the wishes of your
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
constituents in the front of your head
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%

Report all
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
right all right I have a qu I have a
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
question if I wanted if I ever wanted to
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
like either if I all of a sudden saw a
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
sentence that would make me want to
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
change my vote how do I go about doing
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
that think think you if you want to
 
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
change your vote on that's on this you
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
talking about on the last vote we just
 
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
yes exactly if you want to change your
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
vote i' I'd say now is the time to do it
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
either do it now or forever hold your
 
01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:17.790 align:start position:0%
either do it now or forever hold your
peace

01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
now do you want to change your vote I
 
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
did all right well then you have to so
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
so would you like to change your vote
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
all right I'm I'm going to allow that so
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
what do you you I think your vote was um
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
against the itl motion so do you wish to
 
01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.669 align:start position:0%
against the itl motion so do you wish to
change

01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
that so you now wish to vote in favor of
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
the I
 
01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
motion all right so the vote then
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
changes from 13-5 to
 
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
14-4 is that correct corre yes all right
 
01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
all right all right um that's fine
 
01:23:01.629 --> 01:23:01.639 align:start position:0%
um all right uh so we still have
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
representative Smith will write the
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
majority report representative Perez
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
will write The Minority Report all right
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yeah if I could just make one
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
comment one of the things that works
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
very well in this committee is that we
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
try to accommodate
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
individuals um to be
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
consistent um in this it would if you
 
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
want to change your vote you really have
 
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
have to be paying attention because it
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
before the vote is announced once the
 
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
vote is announced um now you can go back
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
but it's it works more smoothly if you
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
know if no no you just ask is everybody
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay with their votes or something like
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
that and then you announce the vote no I
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
I I hear you and I think you're I think
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
you're right I'm you know I try to I I
 
01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
try to accommodate people when I for
 
01:23:56.669 --> 01:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
which we are very
 
01:24:02.189 --> 01:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
appreciative um all right um 601 I think
 
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
we are now up to
 
01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.030 align:start position:0%
we are now up to
um

01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
601 uh relative uh to causes of action
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
against companies that misstate the
 
01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts of their business
 
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative trip
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
motion I move itl right is there a
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
second um I'll second
 
01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
um representative trip do you wish to
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes I do
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh when uh representative Reed
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill I was a little
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
surprised and she said that well this is
 
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
the first time around so I'm I'm really
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh get some feel of uh what the uh
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
committee thinks and that uh you know I
 
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
be I'm and that she would be more than
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
willing to work with the committee to
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
make any changes well uh the hearing
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
proceeded and uh nobody asked any
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
questions I think the only person asked
 
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
any questions was rep representative tur
 
01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
and that was the only question so uh if
 
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
she was in intending to improve the bill
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
by working with the committee you know
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
that was an object
 
01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.790 align:start position:0%
that was an object
failure

01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
failure
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh I do believe that I agree with
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative Reed that the bill needs
 
01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.109 --> 01:25:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh is just uh it's full of exemptions
 
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
for someone that wants to uh be against
 
01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.070 align:start position:0%
for someone that wants to uh be against
uh

01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh climate change or whatever but anyhow
 
01:25:50.669 --> 01:25:50.679 align:start position:0%
the the bill introduces it consists of
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
I I would uh consider it
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh falsehoods in uh advertising and uh
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that is a very subjective
 
01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
thought you know because uh if I was an
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
advertising person I'm I'm sure I would
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
stretch the truth but not make it you
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
know false but uh you know that would
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
probably give someone that's uh looking
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
to uh get after the uh fossil fuel
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
companies you know
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
ammunition and uh but uh another
 
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
another item that I think is
 
01:26:47.229 --> 01:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
uh a poor choice is that anyone wishing
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
untruthful deceptive or misleading
 
01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
environmental marketing or untruthful
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
deceptive or misleading Net Zero claims
 
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
is that the person bringing the the
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
action doesn't have to
 
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:11.719 align:start position:0%
uh have
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh suffered any ascertainable loss
 
01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
because of the uh either the marketing
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
claim or the uh zero Net Zero claim I
 
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
think that would be a that'd be a bad
 
01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
idea uh and that
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh this would be very tempting for
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
lawyers to keep these companies
 
01:27:36.430 --> 01:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
busy uh are you saying that could this
 
01:27:38.109 --> 01:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
could be the lawyer's Full Employment
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
Act is
 
01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.870 align:start position:0%
Act is
that

01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
well there are some there are some words
 
01:27:46.990 --> 01:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
that could be changed here uh but the
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
one that I really like is in the uh
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
right of action for harms connected to
 
01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:55.119 align:start position:0%
climate change is uh
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
in the major disaster
 
01:28:02.669 --> 01:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
meaning uh they include tidal waves
 
01:28:06.270 --> 01:28:06.280 align:start position:0%
tsunamis earthquakes and volcanic
 
01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
eruptions now I I have a hard time
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
believing that uh uh fossil fuels are
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
causing these
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
problems and uh that's why I uh believe
 
01:28:21.070 --> 01:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
that the the bill should be itail and uh
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
sent back for forther work all right
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on uh House
 
01:28:29.709 --> 01:28:29.719 align:start position:0%

you

you
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
Vol all right I think think we're up to
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
the last one on our list uh house bill
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
um 614 uh FN and the chair recognizes
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative Burch for a motion uh
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would move itl all
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
right uh I will second the motion
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
representative Burch do you wish to
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh thank you Mr
 
01:30:17.109 --> 01:30:17.119 align:start position:0%
chair um there's a number of
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
difficulties in this bill um one there's
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
no limit on what are considered nominal
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
damages uh that the court could aware
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
could award I mean normally it's a
 
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
dollar it could be $5 but here it could
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
be any unlimited amount there's no
 
01:30:38.189 --> 01:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
uniformity of
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
application the bill makes no difference
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
between an intentional violation and a
 
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
non-intentional violation there's no
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
requirement of malicious or recklessness
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
which is a federal standard for punitive
 
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
damages and in essence this bill could
 
01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:56.590 align:start position:0%
damages and in essence this bill could
easily

01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
easily
 
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
shift um nominal damages to punitive
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
damages um but not call it punitive
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
damages um we're talking about cases
 
01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
even when the grief citizen says there's
 
01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
no monetary damages at all uh and the
 
01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
odd situation where let's say there's a
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
search and seizure and it's determined
 
01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
lawful it's DET to be unlawful based on
 
01:31:26.109 --> 01:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
a new interpretation of the law by the
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
court uh but the officer felt that he or
 
01:31:35.709 --> 01:31:35.719 align:start position:0%
she was doing fine under a prior uh in
 
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
in uh in
 
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
effect uh application of the law my
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
reading is uh damages could still be
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
awarded uh it's there's a lot of
 
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
problems here thank you anyone else wish
 
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
to uh be heard on this um I guess the
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
only thing I would say I agree
 
01:31:56.109 --> 01:31:56.119 align:start position:0%
completely with what the points that
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
representative Burch has made the only
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
other thing that I would say is um to
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
the I I think that there is a real
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
question of the need for
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
allowing under state law a right of
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
action to to allege a constitutional
 
01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
violation because most I'm not saying
 
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely everything but the vast
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
majority of things that could be
 
01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
characterized as a constitutional
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
violation um under state law probably
 
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
constitutes some kind of common law tort
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
whether it's defamation or invasion of
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
privacy or uh assault or battery or
 
01:32:42.669 --> 01:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
false imprisonment or uh whatever um I
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
think almost all of them would uh almost
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
all of the things that could be
 
01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
characterized as a constitutional
 
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
violation would meet one of those things
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
maybe there are a few that wouldn't but
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
um for the reasons that representative
 
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
bur says I think that that's um that
 
01:32:59.229 --> 01:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to have this bill so I
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
would definitely support the itl anyone
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard all right um I
 
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
think oh I'm sorry oh yes representative
 
01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman um so I
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
I think that we have
 
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
heard opinions that there are reasons uh
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
for this bill um and I guess you know
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
some of the examples that have being
 
01:33:25.229 --> 01:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
presented to
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
me uh resonated strongly with me as as
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
being real world examples that that I
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
see uh just you know in my own district
 
01:33:37.229 --> 01:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
and in my own conversations and for
 
01:33:39.629 --> 01:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
example um I was having a conversation
 
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
just in the last couple of months
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
around uh a student who was being
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
disciplined for things that she had said
 
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
outside of the school outside of the
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
academic environment
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
um and I I think
 
01:33:59.390 --> 01:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
that you may be able to come up with
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
some other avenues uh that that would be
 
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
available there I'm not sure that I can
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
come up with them um but I do think that
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
this is an appropriate Avenue uh to to
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
put in
 
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
place anyone else wish should be heard I
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
I guess what I would say on that in
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
response to that representative
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
McFarland is again without knowing
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
exactly what the
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances um it would seem to to me
 
01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
that that would very like if somebody if
 
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
what somebody said was was used as the
 
01:34:33.790 --> 01:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
basis of disciplinary action it would
 
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
seem to me that that would at least
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
arguably be the basis of of some kind of
 
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
defamation that you that you know we you
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
said something that uh that cause that
 
01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
was the basis for us taking disciplinary
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
action against you so that you know can
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
I say that for sure no but I think
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
it it it likely would fall within that
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's that's my U response
 
01:35:00.189 --> 01:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard all right
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
so I uh the motion before us is itl on
 
01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:07.480 align:start position:0%

01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
going to have something next week and I
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
think I said no and I wasn't thinking of
 
01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
this next week we are trying to arrange
 
01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
to have um the legislative budget
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
assistant and someone from the AG's
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
office and maybe the Human Rights
 
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
Commission um here to to uh for a
 
01:37:47.790 --> 01:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
hearing on the uh the audit the
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
performance audit report um I haven't
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay you know what I'm sorry they are
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
available okay all right so I I'm
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully then we'll be able to do that
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
um the other thing uh and I hope I have
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
that material with me I think I do but
 
01:38:13.229 --> 01:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not positive um yeah um I wanted to
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
spend a minute if I could to talk about
 
01:38:17.589 --> 01:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
the the information I sent out we got a
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
this letter from representative uh Wier
 
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
about the uh the budget um you know can
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
you give me excuse me for just a second
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
while I get I think I have it in the
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
bring where else are they going to go
 
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
me uh so
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if we could just take a
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
minute to kind of go
 
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
through um so the first taking in order
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
um uh item that representative y and the
 
01:39:25.149 --> 01:39:25.159 align:start position:0%
finance committee seem to raise a
 
01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
question about is um the board of tax
 
01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
and land
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
appeals and it appears that there's a
 
01:39:37.149 --> 01:39:37.159 align:start position:0%
suggestion that they want
 
01:39:37.159 --> 01:39:39.830 align:start position:0%
suggestion that they want
to

01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
remove um this this is not this
 
01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:47.390 align:start position:0%
remove um this this is not this
is

01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
come is house bill to right okay
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry I was on the impression
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
this that this came from I sent it to
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
you but it comes from house two okay
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
right which was presented to them by the
 
01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:05.719 align:start position:0%
by the governor oh okay um that well
 
01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
they propos apparently to uh eliminate
 
01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
the requirement that the board have an
 
01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:13.159 align:start position:0%
appraiser and that the board have a
 
01:40:13.159 --> 01:40:18.910 align:start position:0%
appraiser and that the board have a
clerk

01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
um I you know
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
I and you don't see how they can do
 
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
their work it would be uh especially the
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
clerk it seem like that might be a might
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
be a problem not having a clerk um any I
 
01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
mean that my view would be to
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
say I'm very sensitive to the budget and
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
and I have to say that the I I think
 
01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
getting an appropriate budget would be
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
in my personal view the most important
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
priority but you know to the extent
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
there are choices to be made
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
I would say at least for the clerk
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
that's not a good idea and probably for
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
an appraiser since that's a large part
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
of what the btla does um anybody and
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
they're not required they're not
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
required to be appra in order to be on
 
01:41:13.629 --> 01:41:13.639 align:start position:0%
the board no that's true that's yet yes
 
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
representative mcfar so I would say two
 
01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:18.679 align:start position:0%
things the first is that I do not read
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
the changes uh as indicating that they
 
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
shall not have a clerk I just read it
 
01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
that they're taking out the requirement
 
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
to have a clerk appointed by the board
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
as a classified state employee it does
 
01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
say the board shall have such clerical
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
staff as may be necessary and may employ
 
01:41:39.589 --> 01:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
such other staff as it shall deem
 
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
necessary um the other aspect of it
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
though with regard to the
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
appraiser um you know I I I think if it
 
01:41:51.870 --> 01:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
were as simple as that we were getting
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
rid of the appraiser
 
01:41:55.950 --> 01:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
um then my view would be that the lack
 
01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
of the appraiser is maybe worse than the
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
lack of you know more more Troublesome
 
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
than the lack of the clerk but I think
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
to be honest in that case the same holds
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
true it it talks about uh having such
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
technical staff as may be necessary and
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
employing such other staff as it should
 
01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
deem necessary so I'm not sure that
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
these these two sentences that are
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
struck there really indicate that they
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
cannot bring on whether it's on a
 
01:42:22.350 --> 01:42:22.360 align:start position:0%
Consulting basis or on some other basis
 
01:42:24.589 --> 01:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
the the skill sets they need no well you
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
no you may be right I mean I guess my my
 
01:42:29.229 --> 01:42:29.239 align:start position:0%
inclination would be that I will say to
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative Wier look we have we have
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
concerns if the um if the result of
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
these changes would be that there's no
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
that there's no appraiser or no clerk
 
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
for the board if the language permits
 
01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
the board to continue to do those things
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
um that that mitigates it um but those
 
01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:55.719 align:start position:0%
are our concerns representative Perez I
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
think they're giving themselves the
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have these positions in
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
an as needed basis for example if they
 
01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
are do not feel for a particular case
 
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
they need an appraiser and might be able
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
to use an appraiser that an appraisal
 
01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
that was already came from a town or
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
whatever then they don't need it if they
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
feel that they don't need a clerk and
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
they can take notes and go from there on
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
their own it gives them them the option
 
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
of not making of coste
 
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
Effective Government how's that okay so
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
I I don't disagree with that I've um put
 
01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:37.639 align:start position:0%
I'm a little skeptical about not having
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
a clerk just uh for for an adjudicate
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
but you may be right I'm I'm I'm not
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
saying you're wrong all right
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
um uh the next one is I'm sorry
 
01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.589 --> 01:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me are you going Mr Char are you
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
going through paragraph by paragraph I
 
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to comment on RSA 498a col 16 oh
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
sure yes may I comment yeah of course um
 
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:07.639 align:start position:0%
this is the bill uh we just worked on
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
this bill I I think it was two weeks ago
 
01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh and we made changes to this uh I'm
 
01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
not quite sure how the crossed out
 
01:44:22.270 --> 01:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
language um affects the budget decreases
 
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
the budget or maintains the budget
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
um I can't imagine that the board of tax
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
and land appeals is being charged to use
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
County cour houses and we changed uh the
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
B the statute so that um the
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
parties if they can't meet at the court
 
01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
County Courthouse if one of them
 
01:44:48.189 --> 01:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
requests that that then they meet at the
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
office the board's office in conquered
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm confused used as to how this
 
01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
would be a budgetary you know I think my
 
01:45:01.390 --> 01:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
impression is that this was I mean the
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
language in in what we have before us
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
was be obviously before there was the
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
change that we made um so
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I think in some
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
sense I mean I would assume that the to
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
the extent that it says that
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
um uh the uh the hearing shall be held
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the county in which the Declaration
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
is filed unless the parties agree to the
 
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
extent they're taking that out I assume
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
if the if it's a money-saving intent
 
01:45:36.589 --> 01:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
they would the the idea would be that
 
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
the board would be able to sort of
 
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
compel people not to be in the county if
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
they if it would save money our bill
 
01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that um and who you know um
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I don't know what
 
01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
Finance would do with that ultimately
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
yes well I I don't know either but it is
 
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
one of their options incorporate our
 
01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
bill into hb2 and also if if we pass hb2
 
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
with this language and our other bill
 
01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
with our other language um they both go
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
to the Senate and the Senate might uh
 
01:46:11.790 --> 01:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
incorporate our change into its version
 
01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
of the uh hb2 although you know we don't
 
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
really want to count on them to do
 
01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:17.870 align:start position:0%
really want to count on them to do
anything

01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
but yeah no I I hear so I you know I
 
01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:21.350 align:start position:0%
but yeah no I I hear so I you know I
guess

01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
I'm the way I understand this process I
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
I thought it was appropriate to get
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
input from everybody here and I will try
 
01:46:32.109 --> 01:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
to you know convey that to uh chair Wier
 
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm not on the finance
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
committee so Finance is gonna kind of do
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
at least in terms of what they recommend
 
01:46:38.669 --> 01:46:38.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to do what they're what
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
they're going to do and I will try to
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
express our uh concerns on some of these
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
things give the language of the bill
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we yeah that we right well you
 
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
both you R Smith are alumni the finance
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
committee does it that's that's true she
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
is far more experienced than fin I just
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
spent one term there that's uh um that
 
01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.350 align:start position:0%
spent one term there that's uh um that
was

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
enough on uh the next item is
 
01:47:11.229 --> 01:47:11.239 align:start position:0%
um appears to deal with
 
01:47:11.239 --> 01:47:12.790 align:start position:0%
um appears to deal with
removing

01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
removing
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:47:25.629 --> 01:47:25.639 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
provision let me see yeah from the
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
um from the provision prohibiting the
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
um the private practice of law if I'm
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly um so the
 
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
provision of this section shall not
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
apply to the direct so that the director
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
of charitable trusts would be covered by
 
01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:49.639 align:start position:0%
the provision of not
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
um not practicing all I don't I mean I
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
to me that's this is an issue for the
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
for the AG's office that's where the
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
charitable trust is
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
located I would basically say that
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's not what does the AG say about
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
um uh the next one is um if I'm
 
01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly from from
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative wier's markings on this
 
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
it deals with the
 
01:48:25.629 --> 01:48:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:28.589 --> 01:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
uh add language that would allow the
 
01:48:28.599 --> 01:48:30.149 align:start position:0%
uh add language that would allow the
judicial

01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%

um not have to
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%

01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
right I I don't see this is what this is
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
what he sent yeah it's like this seems
 
01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
I I
 
01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:56.199 align:start position:0%
don't I don't that may be you know what
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
that may be language that that the
 
01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
governor's office sent of some you know
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
proposed change but I don't think it
 
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
applies to us right yeah so then you go
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
on to the judicial Council section right
 
01:50:09.119 --> 01:50:13.870 align:start position:0%
on to the judicial Council section right
yeah

01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
yes the next one is
 
01:50:25.629 --> 01:50:25.639 align:start position:0%
um um dealing with compensation of
 
01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
council I'm I'm on now on page 5 what's
 
01:50:32.189 --> 01:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
labeled at the bottom 57 of
 
01:50:32.199 --> 01:50:36.510 align:start position:0%
labeled at the bottom 57 of
77

01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
um and that's the judici right inv voice
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so this um and there you know of
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
course as we all know there're
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
struggling I mean there three ways that
 
01:50:52.109 --> 01:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
we get appropriate legal council and um
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
they have no choice but
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
to but to provide that Lal Council and
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
they get build for it and some of the
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
costs are lower than other costs and
 
01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
they're just trying to stretch that
 
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
dollar yeah I I mean my I
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
guess I know representative Smith
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
probably just before you were appointed
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
I know that the we the judicial council
 
01:51:21.709 --> 01:51:21.719 align:start position:0%
did uh propose to the Supreme Court to
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
make some changes uh I think both
 
01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
in uh well I think it was mostly the
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
rules but basically to to say that
 
01:51:32.510 --> 01:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
within a certain limit the judicial C
 
01:51:35.069 --> 01:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
the judge could just approve certain
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
expenditures which seemed to me at the
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
time to make sense
 
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
now I I guess my take on this
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
is I don't think what is anything that's
 
01:51:46.719 --> 01:51:47.629 align:start position:0%
is I don't think what is anything that's
in

01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
here really addresses the the the issue
 
01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
of what are they going to fund
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
how are they going to fund the judicial
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
Council if the you know whether there's
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
going to be more or less funding is
 
01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
that's hpit one is right is an is an
 
01:52:04.669 --> 01:52:04.679 align:start position:0%
issue but
 
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
this you know I don't know that it
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
matters that much depending on what the
 
01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:09.870 align:start position:0%
matters that much depending on what the
funding

01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
is so that they seem to think it would
 
01:52:15.390 --> 01:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
it would ease the way it would be the
 
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:17.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate way for them to continue I
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
guess is what I don't want to use the
 
01:52:21.149 --> 01:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
word ease because I don't think any of
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's EAS right I mean I suppose in some
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
sense maybe the th the thinking is that
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you if the and I I'm not sure what
 
01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
how much this would save but if the if
 
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have to go through the process
 
01:52:37.149 --> 01:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
of having the the judicial Council send
 
01:52:39.149 --> 01:52:39.159 align:start position:0%
it to the judge have the judge sign off
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
on something that which is just sort of
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
extra paperwork maybe that saves a
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
little money I
 
01:52:49.390 --> 01:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
I I'm skeptical but maybe
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
um all right um and then sorry there was
 
01:52:54.589 --> 01:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
uh you know what I I think I skipped
 
01:52:56.910 --> 01:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
over one thing that I think is actually
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
pretty important there is uh you'll see
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
on page 51 of
 
01:53:06.669 --> 01:53:06.679 align:start position:0%
77 there with regard
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
to children in dependency proceedings
 
01:53:14.069 --> 01:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
there is a proposal to
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
extend the dates in
 
01:53:16.719 --> 01:53:19.189 align:start position:0%
extend the dates in
which

01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:53:22.750 --> 01:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
um the appointment of council
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
for children is
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
um for lack of a better term is sort of
 
01:53:31.709 --> 01:53:31.719 align:start position:0%
fully um implemented and let me uh I I
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
asked the
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
um for the copy of the original bill
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
2024 that is referenced there
 
01:53:46.589 --> 01:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
um hang on one
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
second no they're they're extend they're
 
01:53:52.589 --> 01:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
they're pushing out the time within
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
which Council within which the statute
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
requiring Council in certain cases in
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
dependency cases takes effect and I
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
think the in other words the idea is to
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
save money they want to they want to
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
push it out for a couple of years to
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
save some money was this the CFL bill
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
on court appointed Council for kids um
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's the bill it's it's uh um
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
463 from
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
2024 which
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
became uh 2024 laws two chapter 296
 
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
section 6 and what section six says
 
01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:39.189 align:start position:0%
section 6 and what section six says
is

01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:42.850 align:start position:0%
um the that the effective
 
01:54:42.850 --> 01:54:44.669 align:start position:0%
um the that the effective
[Music]

01:54:44.669 --> 01:54:44.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:48.589 --> 01:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
dates of hang
 
01:54:59.550 --> 01:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
right the the effective date um
 
01:55:07.149 --> 01:55:07.159 align:start position:0%
that the changes made by that law to the
 
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
requirement to appoint councel to
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
represent the expressed interest of a
 
01:55:16.589 --> 01:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
child um would be pushed out that under
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
the original bill it became effective on
 
01:55:23.069 --> 01:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:26.669 --> 01:55:26.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me this proposal I guess from the
 
01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
governor would extend it by two years to
 
01:55:32.910 --> 01:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
2028 yes I really respectfully I really
 
01:55:34.350 --> 01:55:34.360 align:start position:0%
think that this should go over to the
 
01:55:36.669 --> 01:55:36.679 align:start position:0%
CFL committee to look at because this
 
01:55:39.709 --> 01:55:39.719 align:start position:0%
bill underwent extensive revisions and
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
whatnot and it has a lot to do with the
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
children who were outplaced out of state
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you guys remember but
 
01:55:47.310 --> 01:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
over at the bled sod Center who were
 
01:55:49.390 --> 01:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
really going some re undergoing some
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
really abusive situations and we need to
 
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:53.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that stuff like that doesn't
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
happen I mean they were in a rat
 
01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
infested home being really abused so I I
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
really think that the the members who
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
worked on this might be better able to
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
kind of speak to it I I get that it's
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
that it is a costly item but I I think
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
where there were the ones who heard it
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
and worked on it we should really defer
 
01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
back to them yeah no that's I I will uh
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
I will raise this with uh chair Pearson
 
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
and say you know maybe uh um you ought
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
to you ought to uh talk to to chair wer
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:56:29.470 --> 01:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
else you did have two
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%

almost better than exactly exactly um so
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
um uh what was I gonna say
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
um the reports by tomorrow morning if I
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
could please um and uh oh uh we'll have
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
uh hearing on the our last two bills on
 
01:57:59.310 --> 01:57:59.320 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and then we'll have our exec
 
01:58:02.189 --> 01:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
session I hope it goes as quickly as
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
this one went I'm not quite sure it will
 
01:58:07.870 --> 01:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
but I'm hoping um since 14 and there
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
were right we have were only nine today
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
only nine today um I just thought I'd
 
01:58:16.750 --> 01:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
mention right right and so uh we will it
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
sounds like I I need to I need to make
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
sure of this uh um but it sounds like we
 
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
will have a meeting on the
 
01:58:27.550 --> 01:58:27.560 align:start position:0%
19th uh it probably that will be the O
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
the the uh budget assistant performance
 
01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
audit on the Human Rights Commission
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
will probably be the only thing on the
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
agenda because we've now heard and will
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
have exec all our bills so it shouldn't
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
be long we'll probably start at 10: and
 
01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
you know but and you will you will each
 
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
get a
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
copy of the
 
01:58:48.119 --> 01:58:49.990 align:start position:0%
copy of the
audit

01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
and make sure you have make sure you
 
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
have a glass of wine with you when
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
before you start reading it it is really
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
tough reading very tough reading and
 
01:59:03.629 --> 01:59:03.639 align:start position:0%
this is all this was all transpired at
 
01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
the request of the Judiciary
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
Committee did I have my I read mine or
 
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.430 align:start position:0%
Committee did I have my I read mine or
chance

01:59:14.430 --> 01:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.310 --> 01:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
that um all right do we have any uh yes
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative Manos um Mr chair I
 
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
believe you mentioned there were two
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
performance Audits and um I I thought
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
you had said that and I was just
 
01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could clarify what the
 
01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
other one is if there isn't oh no I'm
 
01:59:33.069 --> 01:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
sorry I think the only one that I'm I
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
miss no it's just they're performance
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
aics all the time and they're excellent
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
but for this committee I think it's just
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
this is the only one right all
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
right right all right any um any other
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
business all right I I no I think we're
 
01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
adjourned and thank you to our
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%

01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%

01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
much all right but as as to the
 
01:59:59.350 --> 01:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
performance audits that were adjourned I
 
02:00:02.350 --> 02:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
would say to you I hope that reading
 
02:00:05.790 --> 02:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
this you will get caught up in their
 
02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
value and from now on each time that
 
02:00:13.589 --> 02:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
another one is produced that you read it
 
02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
because the quality of the work is
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
superb and it really helps to inform
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
