00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
Bill listed today uh for consideration
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
and executive session is Senate Bill 349
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
representative kushman did you have a
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
motion yes uh I move itl on this bill
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
and I can second that uh would you like
 
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion sure thank you
 
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
um so the council um is already in
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
existence and they do collaborate with
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh medical professionals already and we
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
have the commission to study the primary
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce and um state of rural Health
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire at this time and we
 
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
just added a member of um direct
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
Frontier to that commission uh to bring
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
the free market perspective of direct
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Providers um we also have a
 
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.510 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Providers um we also have a
growing

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
growing
 
00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
um Market of postpartum doulas that
 
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
offer support to women postpartum and
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
can refer for care um typically women
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
have follow-ups with their Physicians
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
after they give birth and I think that
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
um especially with the this new uh
 
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
direct Primary Care market and the
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
growing Midwifery and Doula um provider
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
base uh that we have in New Hampshire
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
and you know we already have these
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
studies on it it's uh it's a little bit
 
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
of a jump for the council to be uh going
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
into this so I I would uh I would
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
suggest that it's not the time it's a
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
little too soon um and it's not
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate and also the um we should it
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
kind of undermines community um instead
 
00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
of sending mandated reporters into
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
people's homes we should be encouraging
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
people to reach out to their supports
 
00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:34.519 align:start position:0%
that they have um and not kind of I
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
understand that it says voluntary right
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
now um but I just see it as kind of
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
putting a nose Under the Tent to kind of
 
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
creeping into people's homes so that's
 
00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
all thank you thank you I'm
 
00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:47.310 align:start position:0%
all thank you thank you I'm
representative

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman I'm sorry
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm not going to be able to go
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
along with that as I read the bill um it
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
is a report to give us a good idea of
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
where we are now and it's fine to say
 
00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
we've have all of these things but the
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
question is whether people are actually
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
accessing them or not and whether there
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
are barriers to access that ought to be
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
removed um and I want to make it very
 
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
clear that the program itself is
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
entirely voluntary so nobody goes to
 
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
anybody's home unless they are invited
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
and if somebody does not participate in
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
the program they won't be subject to the
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
report so to say that this creates
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
people going into people's h Homes and
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
Reporting is a real
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
stretch and as we
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
know every new year is a new year and
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
every new legislator and halfway through
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
we all have an opportunity to change
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
everything so uh to say that one bill is
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
going to lead to others and others
 
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
others is
 
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.829 align:start position:0%
others is
is

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:02.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:05.959 align:start position:0%
um true but it's true for every single
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
Bill we pass uh finally I would say that
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
I would hope that in the event this
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
report shows that we have needs that are
 
00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
being unmet in terms of home
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
visits after a pregnancy to support a
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
new mother which is something that I
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
think we should all be very much in
 
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
favor of particularly as it's voluntary
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
and not
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
mandatory um is something we ought to be
 
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
encouraging as a legislature and not not
 
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
um putting roadblocks so I want to be
 
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
sure that we study whether there are
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
roadblocks and and how we could perhaps
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
make services available to all who want
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
them if in fact there are people who
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
want them now and are not getting them
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
which I don't know
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
because hasn't been studied yet thank
 
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
chair initially I was looking at the
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
bill and one of the things that I saw
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
was it's not mandatory it's truly
 
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
voluntary and as a legislator one of the
 
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
things I've come to realize is the lack
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
of information to make good
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
policy and lacking that information
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
becomes critical when we're trying to
 
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
make policy decisions here in the
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislative body by colle cting the data
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
and collecting the information which is
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
again voluntary it helps Drive good
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
decision- making by legislative people
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
like myself and everyone else around
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
this room so I would be opposed to the
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
itl I would definitely want to support
 
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.670 align:start position:0%
itl I would definitely want to support
the

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
ogp other discussion representative
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr chairman um I have
 
00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:52.519 align:start position:0%
some problems with who is on this
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
Council making these recommendations in
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
this report I think there's a lot of
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest because many of the
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
enti on this Council receive federal
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
funds for increasing um cases of
 
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
domestic violence um petitions to Family
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
Court to remove children from homes I
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
think that they are way too embedded in
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
the system that goes in and corrects
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
when there are problems in families and
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
Social Services for them to be uh
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
deciding whether that this program
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
should go forward and doing this report
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
I think that it's going to come out
 
00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:29.870 align:start position:0%
I think that it's going to come out
biased

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
biased
 
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
and therefore I I don't think it's
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this Council to do it
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
um I think it would be more appropriate
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
for the primary Workforce Council to do
 
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
it or DHHS to send out a voluntary
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
survey survey to new parents after they
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
have a baby and then a report can be
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
issued by DHHS and they can do that
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
without this Bill thank you
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative L do you want to speak uh
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman uh sorry I was
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
introducing a bill so if any of this has
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
already been tread let me know um and
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
some of my research um we don't
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the data on New
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about how the different
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
implications of um DCF and and Child
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
Protection impact People based on income
 
00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:11.759 align:start position:0%
levels but when we look at some of the
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
work that's been done in other states
 
00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:16.519 align:start position:0%
they adver they impact people with lower
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
incomes at a much higher rate partially
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
because higher income people can better
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
represent themselves and uh I just as we
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
look at all of this we need to look at
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
all of all of these different factors
 
00:14:28.749 --> 00:14:28.759 align:start position:0%
because I don't think it's a problem in
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but I don't know if it's a
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire so until we can
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
have an idea if there is an income
 
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
linked issue like they have in New York
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
and in other states we just want to make
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not creating more of
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
these interactions in a vulnerable time
 
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
um but more importantly the primary care
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce can look at this and can work
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
on this and um I I I think that as we
 
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
look at our limited resources we make
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
sure that we use these limited resources
 
00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:59.550 align:start position:0%
sure that we use these limited resources
wisely

00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
wisely
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
representative uh Murphy thank you Mr
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
chairman um I also will vote um against
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
the itl motion and in part of it is that
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
number one new Futures supports this
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
bill number two DHHS supports this bill
 
00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
um that was the Bureau of family health
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
and nutrition um it does provide data I
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
think the primary care Workforce is
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
overworked at this point in right time
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
right now and if we have the data that
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
would be available it would be very
 
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
helpful but also to me the current
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
situation is somewhat discriminatory in
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
that only Medicaid patients right now to
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
qualify for home access for you know to
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
assess the the the status of their
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
newborn and their mom's care so for all
 
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
those reasons I would vote against the
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
it motion I don't believe it's perfect I
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
don't believe also that it will lead to
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
further um uh problems down the road but
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
having said that you know the the
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
primary care Workforce currently is uh
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
overburdened and I don't think we can
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
simply put upon them to check to make
 
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
sure that the home health of um a
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
newborn and a mother is um is done so I
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
will vote against the itl motion at this
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
point Thank you thank you uh
 
00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.550 align:start position:0%
point Thank you thank you uh
representative

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
tez thank you Mr chairman and uh uh
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Lon for
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
reminding us that there is a need for
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
data um until that the study and report
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
is issued we don't know if there's um
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
disparate uh anything uh by income level
 
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh I would second representative
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
Murphy's comment this actually does not
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
belong in the purview of the primary
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
care uh Workforce legislative commission
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
and um you know there is a maternal
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
mortality crisis and US ranks really
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
poorly uh compared to other countries
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
and home visiting is a proven method for
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
improving maternal and infant Health um
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
I would say uh since this is just to get
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
data and information
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
and provide a report so we can then
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
figure out is there a need what are the
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
needs um to me this is a very uh uh
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
obvious thing that I would think we
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
would all be in agreement
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
about representative
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
Shapero yes thank you Mr chairman um I
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
know on this committee and in general in
 
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature and in our country we
 
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.350 align:start position:0%
the legislature and in our country we
have

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
um competing strongly held um feelings
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
um but my sense is that people on both
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
sides of that issue speak about the
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
importance of supporting young families
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
and supporting children who are born um
 
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
into difficult situations and um so I
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
see this as kind of a pro-life Bill
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
where we're doing everything we can to
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
encourage help for for people who are um
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
bringing children into the world and
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
creating new families and
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how we veered off in
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
this discussion about people being
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
reported to DCF and having their
 
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
children removed but I don't think that
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's the focus of this bill or this
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
effort um to encourage help for people
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
who voluntarily accept that help um so I
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
will definitely vote against the it
 
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
and um support a different motion thank
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
Palmer I just wanted to speak um in a
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
positive way I'm I'm opposed to the itl
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
um there was a program that did exactly
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
this in Claremont in the mid 90s and it
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
was I think a collaboration of the city
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
and the school and the hospital I don't
 
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
remember the details it was extremely
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
popular with the parents and a lot of
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
these young kids getting them early
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
access to both health care and books and
 
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things and then the funding
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
run ran out and so I would really want
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
to see some study into how something
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
like this could be supported because
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily just a health care
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
issue it's there are a lot of aspects to
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
it that could be very
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
positive thank you any other uh
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
representative Tes yeah uh thank you Mr
 
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
chairman so to to add on um I've been
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
participating in uh work with new
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
mothers uh and have heard from many of
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
them that um in the current times people
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
don't have the kind of community
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
supports that maybe we used to and so
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
this would not supplant something this
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
is because those supports don't
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
currently exist the way we used to our
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
family structures aren't the same as
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
they used to be our communities are not
 
00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559 align:start position:0%
the same as they used to be and so many
 
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
moms even from different income levels
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
feel very alone they feel um that it's
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
hard to get the support that they need
 
00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:10.039 align:start position:0%
even to just understand like the kinds
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
of questions that arise or the kinds of
 
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:14.919 align:start position:0%
concerns that arise and so just being
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
able to have someone who is assigned to
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
you as someone who can be a support and
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
help get mothers through that first year
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
postpartum which is when we're seeing um
 
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
deaths related to substance abuse deaths
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
all sorts of other
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
um reasons why people who aren't
 
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
connected are are dying or they're just
 
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
um no one sees that they're having
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
difficulties and issues and they're not
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
connected to care when they need to be
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
so home visiting is a very well-proven
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh methodology for supporting maternal
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
and child health and making them um more
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
likely to thrive and be successful and

other discussion representative
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
frus I just would like to add that I
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
think that um I will vote against itl I
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
have been in have known some people who
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
have done these voluntary in home
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
visiting and they find lots of things
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
and a lot of support for these young
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
mothers who don't know what they what
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
they're doing right at that point so I
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
think that itl is not good thank you
 
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.070 align:start position:0%
think that itl is not good thank you
thank

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
you uh represenative Coachman thank you
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
I just want to read some of the entities
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
that if home visits are increased may be
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
finding themselves getting increased
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
State contracts if they are the ones who
 
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
are writing this report and they
 
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
encourage more State entities to go in
 
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
there it's possible that they will be
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
growing the amount of federal funding
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
and state funding they receive through
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
contracts with the state New Futures the
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coalition against domestic
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
and sex ual violence um the New
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um DCF all of those will be
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
getting increased
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
funding if you bring them into people's
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
homes and until there's due process
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
within some of these entities I think
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
that is not a safe thing to be bringing
 
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
in government entities at a at a
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerable time in people's
 
00:22:28.269 --> 00:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
lives especially if they're the ones
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
writing the report if someone else was
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
going to be writing the report who was
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
not involved in government contracts I
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
might be open to it but it's not a an
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
unbiased entity a unbiased group of
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
people who are doing this there are many
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
who are have conflicts of interest and
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
are on all different kinds of boards and
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
we see that they generate a lot of
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
revenue for themselves and I would like
 
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
to see unbiased Research into this not
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
these government
 
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
contractors representative
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
Weber the only answer to that is that
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
neither DCF nor the Coalition against
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
domestic or sexual violence have
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
anything to do with a voluntary home
 
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.430 align:start position:0%
anything to do with a voluntary home
visiting

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
visiting
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
program the intent of which is to
 
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that those kind of interventions
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
are not going be necessary in this
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
family that's item number one item
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
number two a report with data is
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
collected a recommendation may or may
 
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
not be made and then every member of
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
this body gets to decide whether we need
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
to file a bill or not and it gets the
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
same process as everybody else so um I
 
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.230 align:start position:0%
same process as everybody else so um I
think

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
that people are frightened of things
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
that simply don't exist with respect to
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
um any other discussion representative
 
00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
Tes yeah I I want to add on to what
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative Weber said which is that
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
neither of those entities nor um new
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
Futures are people who do home visiting
 
00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:15.799 align:start position:0%
home visiting falls under the Maternal
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
Child Health um uh section in the uh
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health services
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
within DHHS there's a whole maternal
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
infant and early childhood home visiting
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
program they're part of Healthy Families
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
new um America there there there there's
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
it's a whole different sector unto
 
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
itself um and it and it's has nothing to
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
do with those entities and also I think
 
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
that when a report is written it doesn't
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
mean that the stakeholders who maybe
 
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
they'll issue an RFP maybe they'll hire
 
00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:47.799 align:start position:0%
a researcher like I think that we're
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
jumping to conclusions about um uh how
 
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
the methodology for how the report will
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
be written and then again seconding that
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
these are not the people who do
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
visiting representative Lon um thank you
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
very much and I want to thank my
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
colleagues for bringing up a very very
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
important Point um the Coalition against
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence is not
 
00:25:11.789 --> 00:25:11.799 align:start position:0%
involved in home visiting new Futures is
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
not involved in in home visiting uh Nami
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
is not involved in home visiting law
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement offers are not involved in
 
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
home visiting the president of family
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
support New Hampshire maybe I'm not sure
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh the New Hampshire children's trust I
 
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
don't think they are the New Hampshire
 
00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
early childhood advisory Council May the
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health Services um
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
would uh the DCF we heard is not the
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is not the
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections is not um one
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
member of the house is and one member of
 
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate is that is the makeup of the
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
well wellness and primary prevention
 
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
Council that does not seem to be a
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
council that is aligned with home visits
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
um after birth in these in these early
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
vulnerable times this is not the right
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
group to do this that is the makeup of
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
that of that Council and it does not
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
seem like an appropriate
 
00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
tasking okay representative TZ and then
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move to a vote if we could
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
yes s just last comment sorry uh thank
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
you I I think representative Weber made
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
the point which is all the entities you
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned actually have a very strong
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:23.559 align:start position:0%
preventing the need for Nami Mental
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
Health Services the need for DCF and so
 
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
they are very interested in the topic
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
and that's why they're uh issuing the
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation that there be a report so
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
that then uh future um efforts can be
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
directed appropriately okay thank you
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
all right with that I'll I'll ask

00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
second that okay representative Le on
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
seconds would You' like to speak to your
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
motion sure um when we were discussing
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
this bill in committee um it was we were
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
all seemed to be in favor of adding
 
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
position assistance uh the question that
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
was said how do we how do we determine
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh who's the primary care or private uh
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
primary or primarily was uh discussed as
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
the as the issue and a number of folks
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
worked on this and uh so I wasn't on the
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
initial uh team that was working on it
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
however as I uh was presented with this
 
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:10.039 align:start position:0%
in discussion with uh The Honorable
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
Jerry kerk um we recognized that there
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
is a there is a challenge in trying to
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
determine who's the primary uh person
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
that would sign off on uh on
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the information to to uh
 
00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:30.039 align:start position:0%
prescribed the uh
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis and um and then I thought to
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
myself I said I I have a similar
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
situation a few years ago I had to get a
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh a therapeutic cannabis card and when
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
I when I went to get a signature I said
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
who do I go to um I have my PCP my
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist my neurologist my
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
psychologist and my cardiologist and
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
each of them had their own opinion and
 
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
of whether I should or not in almost all
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
every case they said sounds like a good
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
idea but in each one of them it was
 
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
their a primary care in their own
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
field uh so there wasn't one primary um
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
so this this inclusion of U paragraph F
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
number five was to um essentially make
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
sure that we people have the right
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
credentials to prescribe and that's what
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment is about is to clarify
 
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.149 align:start position:0%
this amendment is about is to clarify
that

00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
position thank you representative Leon
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
representative Canon for for taking this
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
I know that you were involved in the
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
initial bill that died in the committee
 
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
of conference last year and I'm glad
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
we're following up on this um so this
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue was around the word
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
primarily and at least one member um
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
over on the other body was very
 
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about that language um so
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
there was work that was done and um they
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
reached out to um the medical director
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
and Board of Medicine representative um
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
about this idea primarily responsible
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
and he said when a patient is admitted
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
to the hospital there is a physician of
 
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
record that is primarily responsible for
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
the care of the patient and the
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
Specialists provide advice and provide
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
notes back to the physician who is
 
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
primarily responsible to oversee the
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
patients's overall care this is similar
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
to the primary care provider on the
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
outpatient side for this legislation it
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
does not seem applicable
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
um because in this legislation it's not
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
about uh hospitalization or any other
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
specific event that was my commentary
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
adding so going back to his language he
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
says it's hard to determine who is
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
primarily responsible for any one
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
condition sometimes it's a PCP sometimes
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
it's a specialist such as a pain
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
management Specialist or psychiatrist
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
who's treating the qualifying condition
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
removing primarily or keeping it doesn't
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
make much difference um so that supports
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
this move to remove that word primarily
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
because as we've seen in the other
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and the more difficult it is
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
to understand the harder it is to
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
implement so this is I think good and
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
clean and I just want to note this this
 
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
amendment still keeps our initial issue
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
of making sure that it doesn't have to
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
be a pediatrician for a child it just
 
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
has to be the provider providing their
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
care so I think this is an important and
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
necessary step so thank
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
Weber I just wanted to say that I'm I'm
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
really struck by the
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
S the Brilliance of just tying it
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
the carer to the person who is treating
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
the underlying prescription for which
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis is needed so
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
the the relationship there is good and
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
tight and um I just wanted to say thank
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
you to everybody who worked on
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
this and representative Merchant I also
 
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
want to say thank you to representative
 
00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
Canon um particularly lines 13-
 
00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:58.599 align:start position:0%
16 which is more of a catchall and part
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
of it we normally don't think about
 
00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors which also could
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
provide some level of primary care and
 
00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
since they actually have the ability to
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
prescribe control drugs it allows them
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing so having that
 
00:36:15.309 --> 00:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
there I think is very important thank
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%

Lon seconds any other
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Seth King
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I just want to
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank um Representatives Ganon and
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
representatives Lon for the amendment um
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
I would just my hope is that I don't
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
know how the other body is going to take
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
that Amendment My Hope Is that they're
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
open to it um and my admonition would be
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
not to budge on it at all because my
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
concern is that in the attempt to expand
 
00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
the number of caregivers if we leave
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
that primarily in there we might
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
actually be reducing the number of
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
potential caregivers so um I hope we
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
don't budge on that when it comes time
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
for that thanks thank you
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant just as an FYI
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
the federal department of justice is
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
working the DEA to reschedule from
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
schedule one schedule three if that
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
happens then you can prescribe it
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
anyways I saw that
 
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
yeah any other
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%

uh next up is Senate Bill 402 and pres
 
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
Merchant I believe you have an amendment
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
yeah that's not the one you mentioned to
 
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
me earlier is it or is it no okay this
 
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
is the one trying to correct the U
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
language in the bill there one missing
 
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.520 --> 00:41:05.390 align:start position:0%
 
SC

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
that was the only change is the the
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
punctuation or the punctuation plus the
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
fact is on lines 13 through 16 was
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
deleting it's redundant okay so it takes
 
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
care of the
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
redundancy you want to move this
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
amendment representative yes please yes
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second second
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative Weber seconds
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
okay do you wish to speak to it further
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant yes
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
please the bill came over to us from the
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
Senate and during the testimony um the
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
hearing if you will it was determined
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
that there was a period after the line
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
11 available to the general public
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's current law and by putting the
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
comma in there it kind of confused many
 
00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
things so I reinserted the period after
 
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
the the word public to separate the two
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
so today under current law we can
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
provide covid vaccine as well as
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
influenza by a certified tech a licensed
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
pharmacy tech a pharmacist or a pharmacy
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
intern after that was also looking at
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
lines 11 it was confusing because the
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
Way It Was Written was allowing the
 
00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
certifi Texs to give the vaccines which
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
is not current law so by taking out the
 
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
reference on lines 13
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
through 16 which is really redundant is
 
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
saying that the FDA approves the
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
vaccines and it's not prohibited by the
 
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
CDC as being against the administration
 
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
of the vaccine then the pharmacist would
 
00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:46.839 align:start position:0%
at that point in time have the authority
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
to provide it to the patient as well as
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
to administer it so it's more of a
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
grammatical it's trying to clean up the
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
language more than anything else
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:01.559 align:start position:0%
and if you note on line 11 of the
 
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
amendment um in the original bill they
 
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
had stricken out the providers and left
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
half of a sentence dangling there so um
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
Mrs Casey who always comes into my brain
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
when we have sentences that aren't
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
complete or have dangling modifiers or
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
something like that is much happier
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
today than she was when we saw the
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
original Bill Mrs Casey was that your
 
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
high school English teacher or uh yes
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay it was it would be called middle
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
school now
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
junor other
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none representative
 
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
Leon uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant for bringing
 
00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:45.559 align:start position:0%
this um I see that initially um this had
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
been for vaccines licensed by the FDA
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
that are recommended by the CDC and asip
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
um and I see that the amend Amendment
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
changes it to an FDA approved vaccine as
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
ordered by the IM immunizing pharmacists
 
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
provided that the CDC doesn't recommend
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
against administration of the vaccine so
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
that also seems to be a Content change
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious about a little bit
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
more that was in the original bill that
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
came over from the Senate so it kept the
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
same language it came over from the
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
Senate from Senator bisell um thank you
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
I I actually pulled up what we have as
 
00:44:22.549 --> 00:44:22.559 align:start position:0%
amended from the Senate and um I guess
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
let me make sure that I clicked on the
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
right link opening this up but the
 
00:44:29.549 --> 00:44:29.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
when I let's see as I see that language
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
um you may have been working on the
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
under the bill before it was amended by
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
the Senate um because that language is
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:46.839 align:start position:0%
see yes you went back to um the language
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
changed is that was that has the Senate
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
amended it yes the Senate amended um
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
some of that language um so that it
 
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
would read um differently um
 
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
so the Senate as they amended it and
 
00:45:10.589 --> 00:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
sent it to us um if we were to put it
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
this way it would say that the
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
pharmacist Pharmacy intern or licensed
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
Advanced pharmacy technician under the
 
00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:18.559 align:start position:0%
supervision of an on-site immunizing
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacist May administer uh vaccines
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
licensed by the US FDA that are
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
recommended by the US CDC and and the a
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
IP or successor organization to
 
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
individuals 18 years of older is ordered
 
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
by an immunizing
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and that it has the
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
requirements in there representative
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm wondering if having discovered
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
that discrepancy we might want to put
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
this one off till next week so we could
 
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that conforms to the
 
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
bill as passed by the Senate because I
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's productive for us
 
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.309 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's productive for us
to

00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
introduce uh something that's going to
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
upset at the apple cart to the extent
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
that it might and I do want to apologize
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
to representative Merchant for not
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
reading through the amendment when you
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
sent the language
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday no problem I didn't do the
 
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.790 align:start position:0%
yesterday no problem I didn't do the
same

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
so we want to continue 402 is what I'm
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
hearing and I'll if it's okay with the
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
committee I want to be sure that at this
 
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:21.079 align:start position:0%
point in time the goal is to take what
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
was in the Senate that came over to us
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
and just changed the language to what
 
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.390 align:start position:0%
and just changed the language to what
was

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
there so okay we agree does that
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative L does that sound that
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay like what your suggest all right
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
I'll change it okay great thank you all
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
right we'll continue I'll withdraw my
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
I'll withdraw my motion on the amendment
 
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
if the second will withdraw theirs okay
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay thank you all right uh
 
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
so the amendment is withdrawn and we
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
will continue uh Senate Bill 402 to next
 
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
Wednesday next up is Senate Bill
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
458 and um representative Merchant I
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
once again you have an
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
this is the one we were talking about
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
earlier yeah about the N gerain is there
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
any no mind I was trying to think about
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
402 if I sent it over to OS quickly if I
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
could get it back but tomorrow next
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
week's fine it's not early bill right
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
the early bills are over okay yep than
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
you yes okay we've done the early bills
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
okay and where is off and we had a
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee caucus the Republicans had a
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
committee caucus earlier and we we were
 
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
suspecting this might get continued to
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
next week anyway so so yeah we need to
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh schedule a non-gain hearing according
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
to the clerk's office on this that was
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
the advice the clerk gave us I gave
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
myself which I'm passing on to the
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee okay and his rationale was the
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
even though the change is in RSA 318 the
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
change that I'm proposing is in a
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
different section of 318 therefore it
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
good and what it
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
basically the quandry we're in so to
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
speak is the fact that in the RSA
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
31837 if references
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
retail which is the old definition ofes
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
phes historically always been in the
 
00:49:05.789 --> 00:49:05.799 align:start position:0%
retail sector and so forth during that
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
time we've had now phes that evolved
 
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
into nuclear pharmacies home infusion
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
pharmacies long-term care pharmacies now
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about an in-house Clinic
 
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy by taking out that reference to
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
the quote retail sector it allows the
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy at that point in time
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
to issue a permit and based upon how the
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
owner of that permit wants to utilize
 
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
that permit would drive what rules and
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
regulations they comply with so they can
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
create they be in the board simple rules
 
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
for in-house Pharmacy that want to
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
provide medications to the patient by
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
doing it that way it allows all medical
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
providers not just oncologists to go to
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
the board and at that point in time
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
request a dispensing
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
license um it's comparable to what we
 
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
see in States of Virginia North Dakota
 
00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.270 align:start position:0%
see in States of Virginia North Dakota
South

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
South
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
Carolina North Carolina and Florida so
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
it's not a precedent that's actually
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
been done in other states throughout the
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
country so my talking with the
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
um representatives of the underlying um
 
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
request the client they do have Pharmacy
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
Personnel it's not like we're asking
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
them to hire a pharmacist they actually
 
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
have them on
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
staff at the same time it allows the
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
patient then to pick up all of the
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
medications not just part of it because
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
if you only can do oncolytics then you
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
got to get into the definition what's an
 
00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
oncolytic then you get into the issue
 
00:50:34.589 --> 00:50:34.599 align:start position:0%
what do you do with the medications for
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
no vomiting what do you do with
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
medications with what they call EG
 
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
junctive therapy then you're forcing the
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
patient to go to multiple locations to
 
00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
get their drug therapy versus it truly
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
being an integrated model which we're
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
trying to get to so they have One-Stop
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
shopping secondly by building it through
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy benefit side the patient
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
knows at that point in time what their
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility is if it goes
 
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
into the medical side of the equation a
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
lot of times the patients don't know
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
that afterwards and you get what to call
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
a medical surprise so it really kind of
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
allows for the clinic
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
to bring it internal an in-house
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy what I call a mini Pharmacy
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
actually it was do um rips and Lon which
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
I think is what we're trying to get to
 
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
so they have the ability to dispense and
 
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
that license is under the Board of
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy it allows them also at the same
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
time there's no restrictions on 30-day
 
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.109 align:start position:0%
time there's no restrictions on 30-day
Supply

00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
Supply
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
90day Supply they can do control drugs
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
so they have access to everything so the
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
patient truly can have One-Stop shopping
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the important part here
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
is that the patient doesn't have to go
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
to multiple
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
locations okay thank
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
Weber and I would just add a a couple of
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
things I mean it seems to me that this
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
really solves a bunch of problems
 
00:51:54.789 --> 00:51:54.799 align:start position:0%
because it um once it seems to me that
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
once we approve something specific
 
00:51:59.470 --> 00:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
specifically for oncologics then we will
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
be in that position that we all
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
recognize of having the next Clinic come
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
in and want different kinds of
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
prescribing and I just wanted to also so
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
this is a way of making it clear because
 
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
some people already thought that the
 
00:52:17.549 --> 00:52:17.559 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board had jurisdiction over
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
this but the pharmacy board was
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
unwilling so it makes it clear that what
 
00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:24.839 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy board's jurisdiction is and
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
then the regulation can stay where it
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
ought to be with the people who regulate
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
the dispensing of controlled
 
00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:33.799 align:start position:0%
substances and and finally I just wanted
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
to make one remark about the um duration
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
limitation I know people were concerned
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
about uh DHHS were concerned about the
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid requiring uh that things be
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
dispensed in 30-day increments but the
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
fact is that everybody's Healthcare have
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
just run up against it with treatment
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
for dry
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
eye everybody's coverage and and amount
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
of dosage is um governed by what your
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
insurance company is going to pay for
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
and the practices are very clear about
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
who pays for what and how long and
 
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
that's what the the provider then writes
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
the prescription for so I don't see a
 
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
purpose for limiting it specifically in
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
the statute because one

00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think this is um good
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
because it puts oversight of um
 
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
dispensing medications under the Board
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy um and the way I understood
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
it it wasn't that way with the infusion
 
00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.910 align:start position:0%
it it wasn't that way with the infusion
treatments

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
treatments
 
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
um and I also understand that that
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps this could have been done prior
 
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
but the pharmacy board wasn't clear that
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
they could do that what I'm not clear
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
about is how this small change in
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
language clar clarifies the situation
 
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
and makes it clear
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
that now there will be able to be um
 
00:54:17.119 --> 00:54:18.710 align:start position:0%
that now there will be able to be um
maybe

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
um dispensaries at these doctor's
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
um offices at these clinics but with
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
less um onerous regulations than a
 
00:54:31.789 --> 00:54:31.799 align:start position:0%
retail pharmacy could so could you
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
explain just how this particular
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
language um makes that
 
00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
clear yes represent SPL and looking at
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
the advisory that came opinion that came
 
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
from the Board of Pharmacy there was
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
concern over
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
the language in
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
31837 that it references retail and
 
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
therefore what the Board of Pharmacy and
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
haven't been on the board for 10 years
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
myself has trying to find creative ways
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
to allow for different uses of
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
permit again the same thing when you
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
have long-term care pharmacies you have
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
what they're call Central fill phes the
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
board was in a situation trying to be
 
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
creative as much as it could within the
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
confines of the law so by taking out any
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
reference the retail and just say the
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
board of farmacy has the ability to
 
00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:27.039 align:start position:0%
issue a permit and then the permit
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
would be controlled by the rules and
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
regulations created by the Board of
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy for that practice setting so if
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to go into a central fill
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
pharmacy then those rules and
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
regulations hospitals for instance we
 
00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:40.839 align:start position:0%
had to look at it for hospitals that
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide take home medications
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
to their patients well the board said we
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
could do it for one time only you
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't do a refill on it and that made
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
sense but this allows us to take out
 
00:55:56.029 --> 00:55:56.039 align:start position:0%
that constraint called retail which is
 
00:55:56.039 --> 00:55:57.510 align:start position:0%
that constraint called retail which is
the

00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
Genesis of the pharmacy profession
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
historically it just makes it a little
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
clear to the board that the permit is
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
location response I'm just a one
 
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
followup I'm just wondering since my
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this is not an
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
official um Amendment I'm wondering if
 
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
we could get um like a straw poll about
 
00:56:26.029 --> 00:56:26.039 align:start position:0%
whether the concept is um um supported
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
by the committee at some point before we
 
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
finish okay again it's being continued
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
anyway but um but representative Leon
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
you wanted to comment uh yes uh thank
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
Merchant for working towards um making
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
this be a process that works I continue
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
to have the concern that with only
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
taking out the for sale of retail that
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
we may not be creating many pharmacies
 
00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
we may be creating another large one and
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
that may not happen now but it may
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
happen in the future when we're not
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
around to make sure that that legisl
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
ative intent for many pharmacies that
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
are narrowly focused um with both the
 
00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
powers and the requirements narrowly
 
00:57:05.549 --> 00:57:05.559 align:start position:0%
focused to the needs of these different
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
providers is honored um I I really see
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
this as an oral par issue because with
 
00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:13.799 align:start position:0%
the infusion products the doctors are
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
able to do this because that is one of
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
the things that is their is their
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
regular care as these oncologists and
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
these infusion clinics and oral par is
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
that now there are there are pills that
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
do a similar thing to what these
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
infusions had done um this is something
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
that representative Merchant worked very
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
hard on and got some great legislation
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
passed to make sure that our other
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
treatment of this would work for oral
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
parity and it seems to me that um these
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
providers are looking just for similar
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
parody so I before we even look to
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
having something that allows them to
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
have animedics and all of these other
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
categories of these supportive drugs
 
00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
those are the antia drugs um before we
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
start looking at all of those we should
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
figure out how to craft something that
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
is narrow perhaps this should be based
 
00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
on request to the Board of Pharmacy by a
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
particular practice so that they can ask
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
for the narrow procedures that they need
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that we have enough
 
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
guard rails that as we draft the as uh
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
as they draft the administrative rules
 
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
we're able to do that and make sure that
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
it stays appropriately limited to scope
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
but um we're going to need to add some
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
sort of legislative intent or something
 
00:58:21.549 --> 00:58:21.559 align:start position:0%
else or specific language to make sure
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
that we're doing this as something
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
that's small and streamlined as opposed
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
to opening something up up that we'll
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
have more options but then we'll come
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
with more um more bureaucracy oversight
 
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
and complications when it might just be
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
easier to have them stop by and do the
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
drive-through at CVS for those other
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
drugs if it means that they're better
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
able to provide these I'm just looking
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to lower the burden
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
overall and I appreciate what
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant has done um and
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
I think that it may actually make sense
 
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
as well to go back to this original part
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
about the 30-day Supply or moving it
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
down to a 30 it started at 90 the Senate
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
sent us at to us at 60 then there's the
 
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
idea of moving to 30 because that has
 
00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
more acceptance um I think that putting
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
that into language that would be in
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
effect until the until the rules are
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
adopted and until it's a certain period
 
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
of time after the rules so that the that
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
these pharmacies actually can be created
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
would be key because um I actually
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
didn't realize until we started this
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
discussion that there's any independent
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
oncologists because all of them have at
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
least some relationships with the
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals but they New Hampshire
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
hematology and oncology does actually
 
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
have an independent office even though
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
they have these other relationships and
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to make sure that
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
we're fostering as much Independence in
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
healthcare as possible um especially as
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
we're starting to move to Big Medicine
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
all hospital-based and there's benefits
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
to that but it's also nice to have the
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
other side of the independent so I'm
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
really thankful that you're bringing
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
this forward and we're going to have a
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
non- derain Amendment heing on this so
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
that we can get this
 
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
right Thank You R Le be more than glad
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
to uh work work with you on language for
 
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.510 align:start position:0%
to uh work work with you on language for
an

00:59:58.510 --> 00:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
little further before ready free Min

before we move
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
on seeing none
 
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:20.440 align:start position:0%

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.029 --> 01:00:30.039 align:start position:0%

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
actual official amendment I only have
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
the language that gave to OS so I can't
 
01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
Forward they may have sent it to me this
 
01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:18.470 align:start position:0%
Forward they may have sent it to me this
morning

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay if they have I can upstairs and get
 
01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:27.069 align:start position:0%
okay if they have I can upstairs and get
it

01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
failing that I have the one that bu of
 
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
yours we can move on to 560 and then go
 
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
back to 559 if that's think gra that
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
Weber also has another amendment that
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
you want well let's let's wait and see
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
if yours is is available I also have
 
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
another amendment that uh all of these
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
amendments are attempts to deal
 
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
with the breadth of language so people
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
might want to consider all of them but
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
the the Amendments I have with the real
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%

Merchant I'll make a motion
 
01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.669 align:start position:0%
Merchant I'll make a motion
to

01:11:08.669 --> 01:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
pass sorry Amendment 2024 1710 which is
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment to Senate Bill
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
559 do I have a
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
second second representative waro
 
01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
seconds would you like to speak to your
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
the intent of the amendment was to
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
narrow down the issue of biological
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
products I heard from the committee
 
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
there was concerns about it being
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
somewhat broad to include exactly what
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
was being requested which is the RSV um
 
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.750 align:start position:0%
was being requested which is the RSV um
monoclonal

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
monoclonal
 
01:11:45.149 --> 01:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
antibody it's technically not a a
 
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine It's actually an immunization so
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
we may have to go back and change the
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
wording to comply with the federal
 
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
statute in order for us to get the
 
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
funding we need but the intent of it
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
that I have here was
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
to take only RSV and make that the only
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
addition to the list and I get into
 
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
opening up potentially a larger
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for other monoclonal
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
antibodies to be introduced in the
 
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry so that was the intent
 
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
of the amendment but in talking with the
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
Department just now the way I wrote it
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
is probably not going to be sufficient
 
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
to comply with the federal statute so I
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
may have to come back to the committee
 
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
next week with something else but before
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
I do that it' be nice to have a straw
 
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
poll with you folks here today to find
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
out if I have support from this
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
committee to modify the amendment so it
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
complies with the federal requirements I
 
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to hold up this committee if
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
the committee ultimately is not in favor
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
of an amendment regardless of how we
 
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
word it if the committee is in favor of
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment I would like to go back to
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
the um OS and as them to revise it based
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
upon the requirements or leas
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations coming from the
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
Department so we can comply with federal
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
law okay um representative Lon uh thank
 
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for your work
 
01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
on this representative Merchant um I
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
almost thought with the biological
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
products you should have added bio
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
similars um but as far as the attempt in
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
order to try and do this I I think that
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to try and figure out
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
what wording Works um I think we can
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
figure out whether or not it's going to
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
pass the whole committee at that point
 
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
but I think that trying to understand if
 
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
there is a way to do this without
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely opening up the barn door to
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
anything and everything would be
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
important so we can talk about this
 
01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.430 align:start position:0%
important so we can talk about this
specific

01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
topic thank you m uh president Lon I
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
would ask the chair though before we go
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
through all that work and another
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
hearing next week it's just a straw poll
 
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
if people are willing to add the
 
01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
RSV monoclonal antibody to the list if
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
the if there's no appetite here within
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
the committee it may be something we
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
have to to think about differently but
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at the committee as a
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
whole if we have a straw poll of what
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
the uh committee thinks okay um okay per
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative Merchants request uh who
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
would support such an amendment or an
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
amend it to Amendment to the
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.070 align:start position:0%
 
RSV

01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
RSV
 
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment given the fact I see enough
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
hands around the table if it's okay with
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
the share I will move forward and
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
represent L on if you want to work with
 
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:27.320 align:start position:0%

01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
set of eyes as well I I'll look at it

01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
available thank you all right so so if

01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
continuing okay um and there was a
 
01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
motion right that needs to be withdrawn
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
at this point was yes and and I was the
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
second okay so you withdraw I assume
 
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
both motion and the uh second I
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
withdrawn all right moving on to the
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
final bill to be considered an executive
 
01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
session this morning sp sp
 
01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
560 uh representative Merchant would you
 
01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:14.270 align:start position:0%
560 uh representative Merchant would you
like

01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
to been I mean you're on a rooll you
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
might as well I initially was thinking
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
of um making an amendment to the
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
bill having been on involved with the
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
prescriptions Dr affordability board and
 
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
recognizing the challenges with
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
transparency throughout the whole
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacy supply chain pvms are a major
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
piece of it but they're not the only
 
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
player but when you start looking at you
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
know manufacturers the role they have
 
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
wholesalers um
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
Insurance parties themselves are you
 
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
offering a motion yes I'm just I'm going
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
to make a motion to OTP on the original
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
Bill and not introduce an amendment
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
second representative L on seconds and
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
then please continue your remarks I just
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to get a motion out on the Mr
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
chair so I think the bill when you look
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
at what's going on in the pharmacy
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
supply chain
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
the 800lb gorilla is really the pbms and
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
how they use the formulary how they use
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
different parts to it um to influence
 
01:16:18.669 --> 01:16:18.679 align:start position:0%
how either what drugs prescribed what
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
the pricing model is going to be there's
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
rebates that go behind the scenes
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of activity within the PBM
 
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
world World itself that is really not
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
transparent and I think the goal here is
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
to allow for a legislative committee to
 
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
begin to a understand what is going on
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
behind the close The Wizard of Oz and at
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
that point in time based upon the
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
information they can ascertain is there
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
a legislation we can introduce to try to
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
bring greater transparency to the
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
marketplace at the same time ultimately
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
bring drugs becoming more affordable to
 
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
the patients so I'm in totally support
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
of the underlying bill as in introduced
 
01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
to us by the Senate with no additional
 
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
amendments representative land did you
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to you a second uh yes
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant for part being
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
part of the group to bring this forward
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh many many years ago when I was
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
working as an analyst on Wall Street
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
when my senior analyst left my company I
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
was given the opportunity to cover pbms
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
back in their infancy um it's a very
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
complex and interesting area but I was
 
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
worried about some of I was worried
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
about some of the incentives and how
 
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
they align and I didn't really feel
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
comfortable pushing that to investors in
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
order to grow that market so I stayed
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
with implantable devices um I've been
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
following this field and there's
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
definitely benefits from pbms but
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
there's also a matter of just making
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
sure that as you look to it um that
 
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
everybody says equally balanced so this
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
push and pull between manufacturers and
 
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
pbms and payers and prescribers and
 
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
patients um continue continues to be a
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
good Fair um balance of U priorities and
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
needs um I think that this is very
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
important because this is complex and um
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
it has a significant impact on the
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
overall cost of healthcare and this is
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
one that does have um an impact on
 
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid on private insurers on
 
01:18:10.629 --> 01:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
everybody and it has an impact on what
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
drugs and drugs we actually get brought
 
01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
to Market because you need to make sure
 
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
that a drug will be profitable when you
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
bring it to Market when you spend over a
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
billion dollars getting it approved so I
 
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
think that this is very important um and
 
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to be one of the
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives on there um I know that
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of times I like to know who's
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
willing to volunteer to serve before it
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
passes and hopefully representative
 
01:18:35.229 --> 01:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
Merchant maybe representative
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
Oakford thank you represent other
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Murphy thank
 
01:18:44.629 --> 01:18:44.639 align:start position:0%
you and I would only add that I would be
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
in support of the OTP for this bill
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
Alone um and I don't disagree that the
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
pbms are complex in their nature they
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
very much are it was very apparent
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
myself working with representative
 
01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
Merchant on the uh prescription drug
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
affordability board that they were the
 
01:19:05.709 --> 01:19:05.719 align:start position:0%
single most complex but also the least
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
transparent among the people involved in
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical chain so it would be
 
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
nice to have a committee to look at all
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
of the the people that have a hand in
 
01:19:22.669 --> 01:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
the distribution of pharmaceuticals but
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
the gun but the problem but the to me
 
01:19:28.629 --> 01:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
the one that is most uh or the least
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
transparent the most complex is the pbms
 
01:19:32.669 --> 01:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
and so I think this would be a good
 
01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
starting point that we could um all
 
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.189 --> 01:19:44.199 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing I'm seeing none okay
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay um with that I'll ask the clerk to
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
call a rooll a motion is out to pass on
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%

of the committee um I find myself in an
 
03:04:46.710 --> 03:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
awkward position bringing you this bill
 
03:04:50.269 --> 03:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
as introduc used in the Senate it simply
 
03:04:55.389 --> 03:04:55.399 align:start position:0%
repealed RSA 329 colon
 
03:05:00.349 --> 03:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
49 everything else besides the effective
 
03:05:04.030 --> 03:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
date in the version before you today was
 
03:05:07.190 --> 03:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
added without a public hearing and
 
03:05:10.550 --> 03:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
therefore had no input from the public
 
03:05:15.150 --> 03:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
providers or me so I bring you this bill
 
03:05:18.950 --> 03:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
as amended by the Senate with language
 
03:05:20.670 --> 03:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
that I am opposed
 
03:05:25.150 --> 03:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
to and I want to be clear I am not
 
03:05:29.150 --> 03:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to data collection and Reporting
 
03:05:33.910 --> 03:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
as long as it has strong very strong
 
03:05:33.920 --> 03:05:35.389 align:start position:0%
as long as it has strong very strong
privacy

03:05:35.389 --> 03:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
03:05:38.429 --> 03:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
protections those of you who know me
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
know that I am really interested in
 
03:05:45.630 --> 03:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
privacy and I believe that privacy is
 
03:05:49.550 --> 03:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
particularly important for for medical
 
03:05:52.910 --> 03:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
information this bill as amended by the
 
03:05:56.950 --> 03:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
Senate does not include privacy
 
03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
protections for patients it does not
 
03:06:06.030 --> 03:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
prohibit but allows for the identities
 
03:06:09.349 --> 03:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
of women who receive abortions in New
 
03:06:13.070 --> 03:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be potentially released to
 
03:06:15.429 --> 03:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
03:06:18.309 --> 03:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
Services and as you know
 
03:06:20.750 --> 03:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
that would not be a hippo
 
03:06:24.590 --> 03:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
violation because the department is a
 
03:06:26.349 --> 03:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
hippoc covered
 
03:06:30.429 --> 03:06:30.439 align:start position:0%
entity strong privacy protections would
 
03:06:34.790 --> 03:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
require that all protected health
 
03:06:39.710 --> 03:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
information be removed before mandatory
 
03:06:42.190 --> 03:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
reporting leaves the
 
03:06:46.110 --> 03:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
provider and is shared with
 
03:06:50.229 --> 03:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
HHS this bill now leaves the door open
 
03:06:54.750 --> 03:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
to letting our state government know
 
03:06:57.990 --> 03:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
specifically who is getting an abortion
 
03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for me this is
 
03:07:05.150 --> 03:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
completely unacceptable it violates New
 
03:07:08.309 --> 03:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire values and I think it violates
 
03:07:11.950 --> 03:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
our state Constitution's privacy Clause
 
03:07:15.870 --> 03:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
as well Granite Staters do not want
 
03:07:19.670 --> 03:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
government intrusion into their private
 
03:07:22.910 --> 03:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
information and this includes the
 
03:07:26.110 --> 03:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
identity of women who obtain abortions
 
03:07:27.349 --> 03:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
in New
 
03:07:30.910 --> 03:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the bill also does not de
 
03:07:34.469 --> 03:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
identify the health care providers who
 
03:07:38.910 --> 03:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
perform abortions leaving our doctors at
 
03:07:42.389 --> 03:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
risk of intimidation and threats to
 
03:07:46.990 --> 03:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
their safety we have a hard enough time
 
03:07:51.030 --> 03:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
attract ing doctors to New Hampshire and
 
03:07:53.870 --> 03:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
with labor and delivery units closing
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
around the state I don't think we should
 
03:08:00.630 --> 03:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
be making our state a less attractive
 
03:08:03.750 --> 03:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
place to practice
 
03:08:07.510 --> 03:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
medicine finally this bill gives more
 
03:08:09.190 --> 03:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
work to
 
03:08:12.950 --> 03:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
DHHS without the financial resources to
 
03:08:17.190 --> 03:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
do it I have spoken with the department
 
03:08:19.510 --> 03:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
they project they would need one and a
 
03:08:23.190 --> 03:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
half positions and a secure data system
 
03:08:26.429 --> 03:08:26.439 align:start position:0%
to comply because the department can't
 
03:08:30.469 --> 03:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
just keep this data on an Excel
 
03:08:34.229 --> 03:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet the um total cost for the
 
03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
coming fiscal year from what they said
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
to me would be over a million dollars of
 
03:08:40.800 --> 03:08:42.309 align:start position:0%
to me would be over a million dollars of

03:08:48.349 --> 03:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
ever go wrong with
 
03:08:51.550 --> 03:08:51.560 align:start position:0%

him this bill for me is an unacceptable
 
03:09:07.389 --> 03:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
violation of medical privacy thank you
 
03:09:10.309 --> 03:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm happy to answer
 
03:09:12.309 --> 03:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator
 
03:09:14.349 --> 03:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
03:09:15.870 --> 03:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
chair thank you senator for your
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
testimony um we've heard from you what
 
03:09:20.950 --> 03:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
you don't like about the bill but it was
 
03:09:24.150 --> 03:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
originally drafted by you and right what
 
03:09:25.990 --> 03:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
what what what did the bill originally
 
03:09:27.950 --> 03:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
do what was your intent of the bill to
 
03:09:31.830 --> 03:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
to begin with the intent of the bill
 
03:09:38.349 --> 03:09:38.359 align:start position:0%
originally was simply to repeal 329
 
03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
429 which says this is part of the fetal
 
03:09:46.550 --> 03:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
Life protection act and that sentence
 
03:09:50.389 --> 03:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
which my original Bill repealed said
 
03:09:53.349 --> 03:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
nothing in this subdivision shall be
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
construed as creating or recognizing a
 
03:09:59.830 --> 03:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
right to abortion this version before
 
03:10:05.389 --> 03:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
you maintains that repeal but adds to it
 
03:10:07.670 --> 03:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
what I consider to be a really
 
03:10:11.630 --> 03:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
unacceptable violation of both the
 
03:10:14.670 --> 03:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
patients privacy and also the
 
03:10:18.790 --> 03:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
physician's privacy followup follow up
 
03:10:22.630 --> 03:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um now you mentioned that it
 
03:10:24.510 --> 03:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
didn't have any public hearing I'm
 
03:10:27.990 --> 03:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
assuming it went to the Senate's H HHS
 
03:10:30.190 --> 03:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
committee and and it didn't have a
 
03:10:32.269 --> 03:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
public hearing or what can you explain
 
03:10:34.349 --> 03:10:34.359 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more in detail it went
 
03:10:37.469 --> 03:10:37.479 align:start position:0%
to the Senate Judiciary Committee it had
 
03:10:39.950 --> 03:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
a hearing on the underlying
 
03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
bill this amendment
 
03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
which gerus is in the eyes of the sen
 
03:10:50.550 --> 03:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
president was brought into committee
 
03:10:53.469 --> 03:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
adopted in committee and voted on the
 
03:10:57.550 --> 03:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
floor but did not have any input from
 
03:11:01.150 --> 03:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
anyone outside of the committee okay
 
03:11:01.160 --> 03:11:02.469 align:start position:0%
anyone outside of the committee okay
thank

questions seeing none Senator thank you

also signed up to speak is Patricia
 
03:11:21.389 --> 03:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
Tilly from the New Hampshire Department
 
03:11:35.349 --> 03:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:38.110 --> 03:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
Services good afternoon chair members of
 
03:11:39.630 --> 03:11:39.640 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for the record
 
03:11:41.469 --> 03:11:41.479 align:start position:0%
my name is Patricia Tilly I am an
 
03:11:43.670 --> 03:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner at the Department
 
03:11:46.190 --> 03:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services I have
 
03:11:48.429 --> 03:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
worked in maternal health for many years
 
03:11:49.990 --> 03:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
and I've had the opportunity to review
 
03:11:51.950 --> 03:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
many bills with similar goals as Senate
 
03:11:55.030 --> 03:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 461 I will be providing technical
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
information on the bill the department
 
03:12:00.630 --> 03:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
is not taking a position at this time so
 
03:12:01.870 --> 03:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for accommodating me and
 
03:12:03.750 --> 03:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
letting me speak early on this bill I
 
03:12:04.950 --> 03:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
know that there are many folks who want
 
03:12:07.229 --> 03:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
to weigh in as described by Senator
 
03:12:09.429 --> 03:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald and other Senate Bill 461
 
03:12:11.510 --> 03:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
redefines RSA
 
03:12:14.910 --> 03:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
32949 within the fetal Life protection
 
03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
act New Hampshire is one of only a hand
 
03:12:19.830 --> 03:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
full of states that does not man mandate
 
03:12:23.630 --> 03:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
routine collection of information around
 
03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
abortion there have been several
 
03:12:27.710 --> 03:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful efforts in the past to
 
03:12:30.110 --> 03:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
legislate data reporting systems but
 
03:12:32.030 --> 03:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
because of the privacy concerns stated
 
03:12:34.630 --> 03:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
by Senator Rosenwald technical questions
 
03:12:36.389 --> 03:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
and the financial implications the
 
03:12:39.030 --> 03:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
general court has not yet authorized
 
03:12:41.429 --> 03:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
such collection for Speed I will divide
 
03:12:43.910 --> 03:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
my testimony into our observations about
 
03:12:46.110 --> 03:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
the data and just an acknowledgement of
 
03:12:49.110 --> 03:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
the costs but before I get there we know
 
03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire in New Hampshire
 
03:12:54.910 --> 03:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
privacy is Paramount in everything we do
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
former representative Kirk is behind me
 
03:12:58.870 --> 03:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
and others are going to remind you again
 
03:13:02.630 --> 03:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
of that Duty as drafted Senate Bill 461
 
03:13:05.309 --> 03:13:05.319 align:start position:0%
seeks to limit sharing personally
 
03:13:08.309 --> 03:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
identifiable information however it does
 
03:13:10.429 --> 03:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
require some elements as you heard from
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
the senator um and then in some other
 
03:13:15.630 --> 03:13:15.640 align:start position:0%
areas that uh bring into question and
 
03:13:19.630 --> 03:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
would require to have a HIPPA compliant
 
03:13:22.349 --> 03:13:22.359 align:start position:0%
data system in order to secure and
 
03:13:25.349 --> 03:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
protect that privacy in particular it
 
03:13:28.870 --> 03:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
requires date of in place of an abortion
 
03:13:31.870 --> 03:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
performed per Hippa date of a procedure
 
03:13:34.190 --> 03:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
is protected health information this
 
03:13:36.870 --> 03:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
means we need to be sure that any data
 
03:13:39.670 --> 03:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
collection is secure and in compliance
 
03:13:42.750 --> 03:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
with HIPPA standards so starting on uh
 
03:13:45.229 --> 03:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
line eight of page one we see a full
 
03:13:48.309 --> 03:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
list of proposed data elements I talked
 
03:13:50.590 --> 03:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit about date we also need to
 
03:13:53.550 --> 03:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
address the word place there is no
 
03:13:56.670 --> 03:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
definition in the current bill of place
 
03:13:59.429 --> 03:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
so this could be an address it could be
 
03:14:02.190 --> 03:14:02.200 align:start position:0%
a broader geographical location like a
 
03:14:05.070 --> 03:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
county or it could be a facility type
 
03:14:07.830 --> 03:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
like a hospital including a specific
 
03:14:10.070 --> 03:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
name I would encourage the committee to
 
03:14:12.790 --> 03:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
consider what it is they mean by the
 
03:14:12.800 --> 03:14:13.990 align:start position:0%
consider what it is they mean by the
word

03:14:13.990 --> 03:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
word
 
03:14:17.190 --> 03:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
place um we would and in order for the
 
03:14:18.990 --> 03:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
Department to enact this we would
 
03:14:21.309 --> 03:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
clearly need we would need clear
 
03:14:24.510 --> 03:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
legislative intent moving to line 12 the
 
03:14:26.190 --> 03:14:26.200 align:start position:0%
department recommends that the cons
 
03:14:28.910 --> 03:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee consider changing gestational
 
03:14:31.269 --> 03:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
age when the abortion was performed to
 
03:14:34.870 --> 03:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
be redefined to estimated gestational
 
03:14:36.910 --> 03:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
age this would be in better alignment
 
03:14:39.469 --> 03:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
with clinical recommendations and quite
 
03:14:41.150 --> 03:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
frankly this is where rul making
 
03:14:43.030 --> 03:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
Authority similar that is granted to
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire statutes where we
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
that require Health Data reporting it
 
03:14:50.710 --> 03:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
would be helpful so because of the
 
03:14:53.269 --> 03:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
sensitivity of the proposed data
 
03:14:55.469 --> 03:14:55.479 align:start position:0%
elements the department would need to
 
03:14:58.710 --> 03:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
collect the information through a secure
 
03:15:02.070 --> 03:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
data repository this is not the kind of
 
03:15:03.790 --> 03:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
private sensitive health information
 
03:15:05.550 --> 03:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
that you want delivered you know on the
 
03:15:07.950 --> 03:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
back of a napkin or on a slip of a piece
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
of paper or an Excel spreadsheet or sent
 
03:15:13.750 --> 03:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
to an ancient fax machine especially
 
03:15:15.710 --> 03:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
when we consider that there will be
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
numbers of these rep reports coming in
 
03:15:20.950 --> 03:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
we want to do this if if required we
 
03:15:22.349 --> 03:15:22.359 align:start position:0%
need to do it
 
03:15:24.389 --> 03:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
appropriately so that means the
 
03:15:26.469 --> 03:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
department would need to develop a new
 
03:15:28.750 --> 03:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
hipa compliant electronic mechanism for
 
03:15:31.349 --> 03:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers to report data no
 
03:15:34.030 --> 03:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
such system uh currently exist or could
 
03:15:36.590 --> 03:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
be repurposed for this activity so this
 
03:15:38.710 --> 03:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
is where we get to cost there's a range
 
03:15:41.150 --> 03:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
of costs as we all know to implement any
 
03:15:43.469 --> 03:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
system there are no funds available at
 
03:15:45.389 --> 03:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
the department at this time or or
 
03:15:47.150 --> 03:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
currently scheduled to be budgeted in
 
03:15:50.030 --> 03:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
the next panium budget adding to the
 
03:15:53.110 --> 03:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
operational cost would be the need for a
 
03:15:56.990 --> 03:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
full-time um coordinator to un to uh
 
03:15:59.710 --> 03:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
look at the data report uh coordinate
 
03:16:03.269 --> 03:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
and Report the data um and an addition
 
03:16:06.590 --> 03:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
part-time Prov um it's System Manager
 
03:16:08.710 --> 03:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
administrator to maintain system
 
03:16:11.429 --> 03:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
operations onboarding facilities
 
03:16:13.750 --> 03:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining user access these are all
 
03:16:16.389 --> 03:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
standard things we have for our other
 
03:16:19.269 --> 03:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
data reporting systems in the state line
 
03:16:21.990 --> 03:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
19 highlights that the bill is effective
 
03:16:24.269 --> 03:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
upon passage but because of the
 
03:16:26.349 --> 03:16:26.359 align:start position:0%
technical requirements that I have
 
03:16:29.349 --> 03:16:29.359 align:start position:0%
detailed and financial considerations um
 
03:16:32.469 --> 03:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
an effective date of on Passage would
 
03:16:35.389 --> 03:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
really be impossible we do not have a
 
03:16:38.830 --> 03:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism today to collect the data the
 
03:16:40.990 --> 03:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
committee at the end of the day is going
 
03:16:43.389 --> 03:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
to balance the importance of this
 
03:16:46.110 --> 03:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
Private health information and the cost
 
03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
of collection
 
03:16:50.110 --> 03:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
we ask that you're in your Calculus you
 
03:16:52.990 --> 03:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
take care in defining data elements and
 
03:16:55.189 --> 03:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
ensure that adequate resources are
 
03:16:57.710 --> 03:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
available to support the development of
 
03:17:00.510 --> 03:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
necessary systems and ongoing operations
 
03:17:04.309 --> 03:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
to secure privacy thank you thank you
 
03:17:04.319 --> 03:17:06.389 align:start position:0%
to secure privacy thank you thank you
representative

03:17:06.389 --> 03:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:17:09.229 --> 03:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and thanks
 
03:17:11.950 --> 03:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
you miss Tilly for taking this question
 
03:17:16.189 --> 03:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
I know in the past when similar um bills
 
03:17:18.269 --> 03:17:18.279 align:start position:0%
have been brought to to this committee
 
03:17:19.469 --> 03:17:19.479 align:start position:0%
there they were brought with the
 
03:17:23.030 --> 03:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
intention of reporting um this
 
03:17:23.040 --> 03:17:24.229 align:start position:0%
intention of reporting um this
information

03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
to um the federal government to the CDC
 
03:17:30.189 --> 03:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
is that is that the intention of this
 
03:17:31.950 --> 03:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
bill as far as you know or do you not
 
03:17:34.830 --> 03:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
know I I can't see where it says sure so
 
03:17:36.510 --> 03:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question
 
03:17:39.070 --> 03:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative um so I don't know the
 
03:17:41.070 --> 03:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
intention of the bill um we were not
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
consulted around the intention of the
 
03:17:44.950 --> 03:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
bill I can tell you that the data
 
03:17:47.630 --> 03:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
elements that are listed in this
 
03:17:50.229 --> 03:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
particular Bill are far fewer than what
 
03:17:53.590 --> 03:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
CDC recommends um so we would have to
 
03:17:56.309 --> 03:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
figure that out moving forward of if CDC
 
03:17:58.269 --> 03:17:58.279 align:start position:0%
would even be interested in this level
 
03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
of data because the CDC actually
 
03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
recommends a much broader set of of
 
03:18:06.110 --> 03:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
information and I I just to be clear the
 
03:18:08.670 --> 03:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
CDC does not require this information it
 
03:18:11.469 --> 03:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
is on a voluntary basis just to be
 
03:18:13.910 --> 03:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
clear other questions representative
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
kosman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:18:18.550 --> 03:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
you Miss Tilly for being here um would
 
03:18:20.790 --> 03:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
the department be more comfortable if
 
03:18:23.990 --> 03:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
these records were sent to um the
 
03:18:26.349 --> 03:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
division for Vital Statistics since they
 
03:18:29.469 --> 03:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
do um similar data upkeep regarding the
 
03:18:29.479 --> 03:18:30.510 align:start position:0%
do um similar data upkeep regarding the
birth

03:18:30.510 --> 03:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
birth
 
03:18:32.830 --> 03:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
worksheet thank you for that for that
 
03:18:34.950 --> 03:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
question so in the past we have had
 
03:18:36.990 --> 03:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
bills that have looked at abortion
 
03:18:39.110 --> 03:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
statistics in which the data went
 
03:18:41.710 --> 03:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
directly to Vital Statistics the
 
03:18:43.030 --> 03:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
relationship that the Department of
 
03:18:45.030 --> 03:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services has with the
 
03:18:46.830 --> 03:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office is they
 
03:18:48.990 --> 03:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
collect um they collect the data but we
 
03:18:51.670 --> 03:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
are responsible for the health data for
 
03:18:54.189 --> 03:18:54.199 align:start position:0%
any analysis on that data so we would
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
get the information through them they
 
03:18:58.349 --> 03:18:58.359 align:start position:0%
would you know in the scenario that
 
03:19:00.670 --> 03:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
you're discussing as in previous bills
 
03:19:02.349 --> 03:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
they would incur the cost of the data
 
03:19:04.510 --> 03:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
collection system we would then incur
 
03:19:08.110 --> 03:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of the analysis thank you other
 
03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative Merchant thank
 
03:19:12.630 --> 03:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr taking the
 
03:19:15.229 --> 03:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
question I do have a concern about line
 
03:19:18.389 --> 03:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
nine age of pregnant Pat age of the
 
03:19:21.870 --> 03:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
pregnant patient and also in regards to
 
03:19:21.880 --> 03:19:22.710 align:start position:0%
pregnant patient and also in regards to
a

03:19:22.710 --> 03:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:19:26.070 --> 03:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
location if we are too specific
 
03:19:28.790 --> 03:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
indirectly we could identify the
 
03:19:30.910 --> 03:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
individual because we could link the age
 
03:19:32.830 --> 03:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
Pi a small community
 
03:19:35.670 --> 03:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
to um a patient and I think I do have a
 
03:19:38.309 --> 03:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
grave concern about that being in there
 
03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
particular if you narrow down the
 
03:19:42.150 --> 03:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
location or the place of the abortion is
 
03:19:42.160 --> 03:19:44.870 align:start position:0%
location or the place of the abortion is
relatively

03:19:44.870 --> 03:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
narrow thank you was there a question
 
03:19:51.189 --> 03:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
question qu sorry my question is what
 
03:19:53.469 --> 03:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
can we do to prevent the issue of the
 
03:19:55.910 --> 03:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
the location what do you recommend sorry
 
03:19:55.920 --> 03:19:56.790 align:start position:0%
the location what do you recommend sorry
for

03:19:56.790 --> 03:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:19:59.630 --> 03:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
the question thank you I think the the
 
03:20:02.389 --> 03:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
committee needs to consider um both
 
03:20:04.429 --> 03:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
privacy and also the accuracy of the
 
03:20:06.309 --> 03:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
data or what it is the intent of the
 
03:20:08.910 --> 03:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
data would be I can tell you that in
 
03:20:12.349 --> 03:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
other data sets when we have information
 
03:20:14.349 --> 03:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
um that has some of this protected
 
03:20:16.229 --> 03:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
health information in it for other
 
03:20:16.239 --> 03:20:17.269 align:start position:0%
health information in it for other
health

03:20:17.269 --> 03:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
health
 
03:20:19.950 --> 03:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
um areas uh we don't release when there
 
03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
are small numbers in a small area so
 
03:20:24.550 --> 03:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
again with your description we would not
 
03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
release you know potentially under five
 
03:20:31.110 --> 03:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
events in a in a town that information
 
03:20:33.429 --> 03:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
then is reported to us it is not
 
03:20:33.439 --> 03:20:34.870 align:start position:0%
then is reported to us it is not
publicly

03:20:34.870 --> 03:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
03:20:38.469 --> 03:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
released follow up thank you for that so
 
03:20:40.790 --> 03:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
in this bill the way it's written where
 
03:20:44.110 --> 03:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
would that prevent the re release of the
 
03:20:46.030 --> 03:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
the information we're talking about so
 
03:20:47.790 --> 03:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
this is um thank you for the question
 
03:20:49.630 --> 03:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the followup um this is
 
03:20:51.189 --> 03:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
where something like administrative
 
03:20:52.790 --> 03:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
rules are helpful because we could
 
03:20:56.189 --> 03:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
detail that level of what will be uh
 
03:20:58.550 --> 03:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
publicly presented and what will not be
 
03:21:00.229 --> 03:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
publicly presented you could put it in
 
03:21:02.830 --> 03:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
Statue you could put something about uh
 
03:21:04.750 --> 03:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
I think the committee needs to consider
 
03:21:06.389 --> 03:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
what the definition of place is
 
03:21:09.750 --> 03:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
primarily and then um determine if age
 
03:21:12.309 --> 03:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
is an important item for you to collect
 
03:21:14.110 --> 03:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
and then you could put in additional
 
03:21:16.189 --> 03:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
language either in the statute or give
 
03:21:18.790 --> 03:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
us the um rul making Authority where we
 
03:21:23.950 --> 03:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
disclosed if I could follow go back to
 
03:21:29.070 --> 03:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
rule making so do we have
 
03:21:31.710 --> 03:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
to it's more of a procedural question
 
03:21:33.229 --> 03:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
maybe to the chair somebody else do we
 
03:21:35.229 --> 03:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
need to include ruem Authority in here
 
03:21:37.830 --> 03:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
so the department has rule making
 
03:21:40.389 --> 03:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
Authority because without that I'm not
 
03:21:41.910 --> 03:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
sure they have broad up Ru making
 
03:21:43.150 --> 03:21:43.160 align:start position:0%
authority to accomplish what we're
 
03:21:44.950 --> 03:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
asking them to
 
03:21:47.070 --> 03:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish good question that I don't
 
03:21:50.150 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
know I mean Miss Tilly would you know
 
03:21:52.710 --> 03:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah typically in statutes like this
 
03:21:56.030 --> 03:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
there is a granting of rulle making
 
03:21:59.710 --> 03:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:02.990 --> 03:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
Weber as an initial matter Mr chairman
 
03:22:05.550 --> 03:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
um I note that I am one of the sponsors
 
03:22:08.389 --> 03:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
of the original Bill uh and it's my
 
03:22:09.710 --> 03:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that I am allowed either
 
03:22:12.750 --> 03:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
to ask questions or to speak to the bill
 
03:22:14.950 --> 03:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
but not both is that correct that's my
 
03:22:17.070 --> 03:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
understanding Okay so uh and you've
 
03:22:19.910 --> 03:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
called on me so I will go ahead and ask
 
03:22:24.389 --> 03:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
the questions um if if you know uh in
 
03:22:27.590 --> 03:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
your interactions with Vital
 
03:22:30.750 --> 03:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
Statistics uh is this the kind of
 
03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
statistic they currently correla and do
 
03:22:33.279 --> 03:22:34.229 align:start position:0%
statistic they currently correla and do
they

03:22:34.229 --> 03:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:22:34.239 --> 03:22:36.910 align:start position:0%
they
have

03:22:36.910 --> 03:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:38.590 align:start position:0%
have
um

03:22:38.590 --> 03:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
systems that are currently Geared for
 
03:22:43.189 --> 03:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
this kind of statistic as opposed to the
 
03:22:44.950 --> 03:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
ones that they currently colle they
 
03:22:46.990 --> 03:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
currently do not collect this kind of
 
03:22:49.070 --> 03:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
statistic this would be new information
 
03:22:51.150 --> 03:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
for them and you know I don't want to
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
speak for the Secretary of State's
 
03:22:54.790 --> 03:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
office or Vital Records but there would
 
03:22:58.110 --> 03:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
be providers um feasibly who would need
 
03:23:00.070 --> 03:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
to report that typically don't report
 
03:23:02.309 --> 03:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
into Vital Statistics
 
03:23:05.189 --> 03:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
now followup it's actually a different
 
03:23:06.630 --> 03:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
question sure go
 
03:23:10.990 --> 03:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
ahead so um did you give us a sort of
 
03:23:14.269 --> 03:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
estimate or any kind of a range of what
 
03:23:16.590 --> 03:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
such a system if if you were doing it in
 
03:23:21.710 --> 03:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
DHHS is this bill requires um the the of
 
03:23:24.110 --> 03:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
of the cost for a system for you short
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
so as you know there's no fiscal note
 
03:23:27.189 --> 03:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
attached to this bill so we did not
 
03:23:29.469 --> 03:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
provide one um we think that there's a
 
03:23:33.670 --> 03:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
range of costs I would prefer to um have
 
03:23:35.710 --> 03:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
the committee go through some of these
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
data elements and consider and then we
 
03:23:39.269 --> 03:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
could probably come back to you with a
 
03:23:41.990 --> 03:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
more refined number we will need a
 
03:23:44.150 --> 03:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
system and we will need someone to run
 
03:23:46.229 --> 03:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
that system is really I think the place
 
03:23:48.670 --> 03:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
where you can start okay I believe
 
03:23:50.429 --> 03:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenal mentioned a million
 
03:23:50.439 --> 03:23:52.150 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenal mentioned a million
dollars

03:23:52.150 --> 03:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:23:55.030 --> 03:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
is in in a conversation that we had
 
03:23:59.150 --> 03:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
previously that was my off the head um
 
03:24:01.630 --> 03:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
uh estimation but again we would want to
 
03:24:03.389 --> 03:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
know more exactly about the data
 
03:24:04.790 --> 03:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
elements that you're interested in
 
03:24:06.790 --> 03:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
collecting and then we can give you a
 
03:24:09.150 --> 03:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
more precise number okay but do you
 
03:24:10.990 --> 03:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
think that's well you know roughly
 
03:24:14.229 --> 03:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
accurate it's in a ballpark okay thank
 
03:24:17.830 --> 03:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
you other questions
 
03:24:28.710 --> 03:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:31.590 --> 03:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
you this for this
 
03:24:36.150 --> 03:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
year I announce if you can um I sent
 
03:24:40.349 --> 03:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
it okay uh Miss Dyer our researcher just
 
03:24:42.830 --> 03:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
informed me that she got the amended
 
03:24:44.670 --> 03:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on the bill and and at the
 
03:24:47.590 --> 03:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
present time there's no fiscal impact
 
03:24:49.950 --> 03:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
expected um how that might change in
 
03:24:53.030 --> 03:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
time remains to be seen but um is am I
 
03:24:55.710 --> 03:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
accurately yeah okay um okay so um
 
03:25:03.429 --> 03:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
moving on uh next uh signed up to speak
 
03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
is former representative Neil
 
03:25:08.070 --> 03:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
Kirk you've asked for three minutes
 
03:25:11.189 --> 03:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk I did Mr chairman
 
03:25:13.030 --> 03:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and good afternoon to you and
 
03:25:14.309 --> 03:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
to members of the committee for the
 
03:25:16.990 --> 03:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
record I'm Neil Kirk uh I live in the
 
03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
town of we and today I'm representing
 
03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:21.670 align:start position:0%
town of we and today I'm representing
myself

03:25:21.670 --> 03:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
myself
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
um this bill requires medical providers
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
to report abortion related data to the
 
03:25:29.189 --> 03:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:25:32.269 --> 03:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
and I support that concept however the
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
bill is drafted in such a way that it
 
03:25:36.670 --> 03:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
impinges upon privacy rights and I would
 
03:25:39.469 --> 03:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to amend the bill or
 
03:25:41.590 --> 03:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
study the bill to protect these privacy
 
03:25:44.309 --> 03:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
rights with respect to the patients
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
privacy rights the bill allows a
 
03:25:48.389 --> 03:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
patients personally identifiable health
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:54.750 --> 03:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
department section
 
03:25:59.309 --> 03:25:59.319 align:start position:0%
32949 bans requiring the transmission of
 
03:26:01.389 --> 03:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information to
 
03:26:03.870 --> 03:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
the department but it doesn't
 
03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
prevent a medical facility from
 
03:26:07.750 --> 03:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
providing it in other words the
 
03:26:09.830 --> 03:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
department can't require the medical
 
03:26:11.389 --> 03:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
facility to give it that kind of
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
information but nothing prevents the
 
03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
medical facility from naming names if
 
03:26:19.070 --> 03:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's so wished this could be prevented
 
03:26:21.269 --> 03:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
and patient privacy rights protected by
 
03:26:24.389 --> 03:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
adding after as requiring in that
 
03:26:27.630 --> 03:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
section the words or permitting this is
 
03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
especially important considering the
 
03:26:31.550 --> 03:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
recent privacy amendment to our state's
 
03:26:33.309 --> 03:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution which states an
 
03:26:35.349 --> 03:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
individual's right to live free from
 
03:26:38.030 --> 03:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion into private or
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
personal information is natural
 
03:26:42.309 --> 03:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
essential and
 
03:26:44.309 --> 03:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
inherent the Department of Health and
 
03:26:46.590 --> 03:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
Human Services our state has has no
 
03:26:48.189 --> 03:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
legitimate interest in learning the
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
names of women who have had
 
03:26:53.070 --> 03:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
abortions the patient's privacy rights
 
03:26:55.150 --> 03:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
are also at risk if she should get an
 
03:26:57.150 --> 03:26:57.160 align:start position:0%
abortion in a physician's home office
 
03:26:59.229 --> 03:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
and this was alluded to in one of the
 
03:27:02.429 --> 03:27:02.439 align:start position:0%
questions uh prior to my testimony yes
 
03:27:05.110 --> 03:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
even today with doctors uh being
 
03:27:07.630 --> 03:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
Consolidated in hospital practices there
 
03:27:09.990 --> 03:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
are some doctors who do maintain offices
 
03:27:12.189 --> 03:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
in their local community how are the
 
03:27:14.950 --> 03:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
patients privacy rights at risk here
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
current law defines medical facility to
 
03:27:20.510 --> 03:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
include a doctor's office so a woman in
 
03:27:22.910 --> 03:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
a small town gets an abortion at her
 
03:27:24.790 --> 03:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
hometown doctor's office and her doctor
 
03:27:26.870 --> 03:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
because his office is a medical
 
03:27:29.630 --> 03:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
facility would be uh have to be listed
 
03:27:32.670 --> 03:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
as providing one abortion and in a small
 
03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
town it may be very obvious to folks as
 
03:27:38.910 --> 03:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
to whom that woman was to preclude this
 
03:27:40.590 --> 03:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
I would ask the committee to amend the
 
03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill to ban the department from
 
03:27:46.229 --> 03:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
providing its statistical data by named
 
03:27:50.469 --> 03:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
medical facility or type of medical
 
03:27:53.349 --> 03:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
facility medical privacy rights also are
 
03:27:55.110 --> 03:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
an issue here while the bill does not
 
03:27:57.870 --> 03:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
require a medical facility to report to
 
03:27:59.510 --> 03:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
the state either the name or number of
 
03:28:02.189 --> 03:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
abortions an individual employee
 
03:28:04.510 --> 03:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
performs nothing precludes it from doing
 
03:28:07.030 --> 03:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
so the committee should amend the bill
 
03:28:09.229 --> 03:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
to ban that information from being sent
 
03:28:10.389 --> 03:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
to Health and Human
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
Services I would also ask the committee
 
03:28:14.550 --> 03:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
to amend the bill to exempt this data
 
03:28:16.750 --> 03:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
from the state's right to no law
 
03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
as we're all aware abortion related data
 
03:28:22.110 --> 03:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
is very sensitive for both the patient
 
03:28:23.870 --> 03:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
and the medical provider and it should
 
03:28:26.870 --> 03:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
not be available to any person outside
 
03:28:28.790 --> 03:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
those charged by law with collecting it
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
safeguarding it and creating statistical
 
03:28:34.670 --> 03:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
reports finally as was mentioned in
 
03:28:36.670 --> 03:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
prior testimony I would ask the court
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider that there are
 
03:28:41.070 --> 03:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
cost to this bill a secure data system
 
03:28:44.309 --> 03:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
data entry and data analysis isn't free
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
the department is probably in the best
 
03:28:47.750 --> 03:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
position position to provide a cost
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
estimate but an appropriation to the
 
03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
department by this committee even a
 
03:28:54.550 --> 03:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
dollar would be very much in
 
03:28:58.389 --> 03:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
order um one last point that I'd like to
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
make before concluding um there was some
 
03:29:04.070 --> 03:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
discussion before about Vital Records
 
03:29:06.670 --> 03:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
please recognize that Vital Records is
 
03:29:09.670 --> 03:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
not covered by Hippa any information
 
03:29:11.070 --> 03:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
that's sent to them does not have to
 
03:29:12.750 --> 03:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
meet hippo privacy
 
03:29:14.710 --> 03:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
requirements that's different if the
 
03:29:16.189 --> 03:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
information goes to Health and Human
 
03:29:19.030 --> 03:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
Services as this bill requires so if you
 
03:29:21.950 --> 03:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
amend the mill Bill to allow the data to
 
03:29:24.189 --> 03:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
go to Vital Records you are really
 
03:29:28.710 --> 03:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
exposing this data to no private privacy
 
03:29:30.790 --> 03:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
protections thank you Mr chairman I'd be
 
03:29:32.429 --> 03:29:32.439 align:start position:0%
pleased to answer any questions from
 
03:29:34.830 --> 03:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
committee members thank you um and
 
03:29:36.710 --> 03:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
earlier when I said there was no fiscal
 
03:29:38.510 --> 03:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
impact that was a different bill that we
 
03:29:40.349 --> 03:29:40.359 align:start position:0%
had received information on so I
 
03:29:43.550 --> 03:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
apologize for the confusion um the
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
original ballpark estimate of a million
 
03:29:48.309 --> 03:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
do is apparently is is correct uh
 
03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Kirk
 
03:29:50.880 --> 03:29:52.269 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Kirk
representative

03:29:52.269 --> 03:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:29:55.150 --> 03:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and welcome
 
03:29:58.110 --> 03:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
home to your very own committee room to
 
03:30:00.990 --> 03:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
the very own committee room
 
03:30:05.429 --> 03:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering you you had a place
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
where uh a statute which I think is not
 
03:30:13.030 --> 03:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
this one needed to be changed to um as
 
03:30:15.070 --> 03:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
requiring or permitting and I was
 
03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could give give me the
 
03:30:19.710 --> 03:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
the site to that statute again please um
 
03:30:21.710 --> 03:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
it is this statute it's the first
 
03:30:24.229 --> 03:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
section on the bill oh so it is in the
 
03:30:27.070 --> 03:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
bill I'm sorry it's on
 
03:30:30.309 --> 03:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
line um line four nothing in paragraph
 
03:30:32.189 --> 03:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
two of this section shall be construed
 
03:30:35.110 --> 03:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
as requiring and then add the words or
 
03:30:37.550 --> 03:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
permitting the communication of dis or
 
03:30:39.389 --> 03:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
disclosure of personally identifiable
 
03:30:41.950 --> 03:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
health information could I just ask one
 
03:30:46.110 --> 03:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
followup that um do you have an opinion
 
03:30:48.110 --> 03:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
as to whether it's stronger to say
 
03:30:50.510 --> 03:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in this statute shall be
 
03:30:53.070 --> 03:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
construed as requiring or committing or
 
03:30:56.950 --> 03:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
simply saying requiring or permitting is
 
03:30:59.429 --> 03:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
forbidden which seems to me to be a more
 
03:31:01.309 --> 03:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
direct construction considering your
 
03:31:04.830 --> 03:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
legal background uh I would I would uh
 
03:31:08.309 --> 03:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:10.469 --> 03:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
opinion the point is it needs to be
 
03:31:11.830 --> 03:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
corrected and there are different ways
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
to do it thank
 
03:31:16.710 --> 03:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
you other questions
 
03:31:19.070 --> 03:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative kushman thank you Mr
 
03:31:20.710 --> 03:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here Mr
 
03:31:23.590 --> 03:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
Kirk good to see you um I am wondering
 
03:31:26.189 --> 03:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
you said something that um caught my
 
03:31:28.590 --> 03:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
interest because now I'm concerned about
 
03:31:31.349 --> 03:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
the birth worksheet that goes to the um
 
03:31:33.790 --> 03:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Vital Statistics um it's
 
03:31:35.389 --> 03:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
not protected by Hippa and there's a lot
 
03:31:37.070 --> 03:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
of very sensitive information in that do
 
03:31:37.990 --> 03:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
you think that it would be more
 
03:31:40.429 --> 03:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate for it to go directly to the
 
03:31:42.070 --> 03:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
03:31:45.309 --> 03:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
Services to be protected probably yes
 
03:31:48.990 --> 03:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
but that's a controversial issue so uh
 
03:31:51.950 --> 03:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
tread carefully before you move in that
 
03:31:57.269 --> 03:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
direction okay thank you other
 
03:31:59.870 --> 03:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:32:04.429 --> 03:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:06.670 --> 03:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
chairman also signed up to speak is
 
03:32:16.630 --> 03:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh you've asked for three
 
03:32:23.469 --> 03:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon chairman McDonald
 
03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
and other honorable members of the
 
03:32:27.309 --> 03:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
03:32:29.550 --> 03:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
Devon chaffy and I'm here to testify
 
03:32:32.910 --> 03:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
today in opposition of sb4 61 thank you
 
03:32:35.550 --> 03:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to do so um this is
 
03:32:37.389 --> 03:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
not the first time that I have been
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
before this committee to testify on an
 
03:32:42.550 --> 03:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
abortion data collection bill in fact
 
03:32:45.030 --> 03:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature and this
 
03:32:46.229 --> 03:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh and the New Hampshire house in
 
03:32:48.030 --> 03:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
particular has considered data
 
03:32:50.269 --> 03:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
collection bills very similar to what is
 
03:32:54.550 --> 03:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
before you in s SP 461 many many many
 
03:32:57.349 --> 03:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
times in both recent years as well as
 
03:32:59.150 --> 03:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
many times over the last decade that
 
03:33:01.030 --> 03:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
I've been working at the New Hampshire
 
03:33:04.070 --> 03:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
legislature and every time the house has
 
03:33:06.630 --> 03:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
considered such legislation it has come
 
03:33:09.189 --> 03:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
to the same conclusion and it has
 
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
rejected the bill and so that really
 
03:33:14.510 --> 03:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
begs the question of why why has there
 
03:33:16.790 --> 03:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
been such consistent opposition to these
 
03:33:19.670 --> 03:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
types of bills for so many years and I
 
03:33:21.389 --> 03:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
think the answer is simple and quite
 
03:33:23.870 --> 03:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
frankly uh um has been made clear from
 
03:33:26.910 --> 03:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
the testimony prior to mine which is
 
03:33:29.590 --> 03:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
there are serious privacy concerns that
 
03:33:33.469 --> 03:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
stem from this type of data transfer and
 
03:33:35.830 --> 03:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
collection there are serious concerns
 
03:33:38.429 --> 03:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
that you heard detailed um by DG J by
 
03:33:40.710 --> 03:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of these this bill as well
 
03:33:44.469 --> 03:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
as um from uh representative Kirk uh
 
03:33:46.469 --> 03:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
about the personal prate Healthcare
 
03:33:47.950 --> 03:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
information that could be put in
 
03:33:50.550 --> 03:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy by this type of data collection
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
scheme the bottom line is we all know
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
that breaches in of personal health
 
03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
information happen and that they happen
 
03:33:59.150 --> 03:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have seen breaches
 
03:34:00.630 --> 03:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire Department of
 
03:34:02.790 --> 03:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services despite their
 
03:34:05.830 --> 03:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
best efforts to keep information private
 
03:34:08.389 --> 03:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
such breaches have compromised Social
 
03:34:10.910 --> 03:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
Security numbers addresses and Medicaid
 
03:34:14.229 --> 03:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
identifi identification numbers and such
 
03:34:16.349 --> 03:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
breaches inevitably create risk that
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
some Granite Staters personal medical
 
03:34:21.750 --> 03:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
decisions will be
 
03:34:24.990 --> 03:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
disclosed we all know that the risk of
 
03:34:27.950 --> 03:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh that healthc care data can be uh
 
03:34:31.269 --> 03:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
reidentified it's a real risk and yet S
 
03:34:34.030 --> 03:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
sp4 61 doesn't do anything to allocate
 
03:34:37.429 --> 03:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
funding to ensure the security of this
 
03:34:39.790 --> 03:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
information I also want to make a point
 
03:34:42.349 --> 03:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
that hasn't yet been made which is that
 
03:34:42.359 --> 03:34:43.269 align:start position:0%
that hasn't yet been made which is that
the

03:34:43.269 --> 03:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:34:47.070 --> 03:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
risks currently in recent years of the
 
03:34:49.469 --> 03:34:49.479 align:start position:0%
consequences of breaches of personal
 
03:34:52.110 --> 03:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
abortion data have gotten far more
 
03:34:54.630 --> 03:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
significant as more and more States
 
03:34:56.750 --> 03:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
criminalize abortion
 
03:34:58.950 --> 03:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
procedures so in short the stakes have
 
03:35:01.790 --> 03:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot higher when it comes to
 
03:35:03.950 --> 03:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
abortion data and how they can be used
 
03:35:06.309 --> 03:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
by States outside of the State of New
 
03:35:08.990 --> 03:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire after the do's decision there
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
have been significant reporting of
 
03:35:13.750 --> 03:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
harmful uses of healthcare data to
 
03:35:16.030 --> 03:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
Target those who seek abortion Act
 
03:35:19.110 --> 03:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
access there have been uh instances of a
 
03:35:22.189 --> 03:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
data broker broker selling the location
 
03:35:24.309 --> 03:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
data of people who visited abortion
 
03:35:26.510 --> 03:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
clinics there have been cell phone and
 
03:35:28.910 --> 03:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
social media app data being used in
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
abortion related
 
03:35:32.429 --> 03:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
prosecutions and right now we have at
 
03:35:34.429 --> 03:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
least 33 states that have criminalized
 
03:35:36.550 --> 03:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
abortion laws and 16 states that have
 
03:35:39.189 --> 03:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
made it a felony to perform abortions
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
some states have even threatened
 
03:35:43.630 --> 03:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
providers with lifetime sentences for
 
03:35:46.189 --> 03:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
violating these bans and at least two
 
03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
states in at least two states the
 
03:35:50.110 --> 03:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
Attorneys General have threatened
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
prosecution on conspiracy charges for
 
03:35:56.110 --> 03:35:56.120 align:start position:0%
doctors who refer patients out of state
 
03:35:57.990 --> 03:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
patients traveling out of state
 
03:36:00.309 --> 03:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
themselves as well as organizations that
 
03:36:02.229 --> 03:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
assist pregnant people and accessing
 
03:36:04.469 --> 03:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
care in states where abortion is legal
 
03:36:06.990 --> 03:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
so in other words you start wrapping up
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
please yes sir in other words what we
 
03:36:10.990 --> 03:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
see is that in states where abortion has
 
03:36:13.189 --> 03:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
been criminalized they are using their
 
03:36:15.070 --> 03:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
laws to reach outside of their state
 
03:36:17.389 --> 03:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
borders into states where abortion is
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
still legal like the St State of New
 
03:36:21.590 --> 03:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they are using data to try
 
03:36:24.349 --> 03:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
to go after individuals who are engag in
 
03:36:27.870 --> 03:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
conduct Beyond uh their State's borders
 
03:36:30.030 --> 03:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that Granite Staters
 
03:36:32.070 --> 03:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
care about privacy and their personal
 
03:36:34.630 --> 03:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
information as representative Kirk noted
 
03:36:37.070 --> 03:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's why over 80% voted in favor of
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
codifying in our state constitution an
 
03:36:41.670 --> 03:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
individual's right to live free from
 
03:36:43.750 --> 03:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion and private or
 
03:36:46.189 --> 03:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
personal information and for these
 
03:36:49.590 --> 03:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
reasons I urge you to recommend SB 461
 
03:36:51.870 --> 03:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate thank you so
 
03:36:54.750 --> 03:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh representative Seth
 
03:36:56.910 --> 03:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
King and then representative Merchant
 
03:36:57.990 --> 03:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:36:59.910 --> 03:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
taking the question I actually called on
 
03:37:03.349 --> 03:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
Seth King oh sorry that's okay sorry
 
03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh and thank you for
 
03:37:08.389 --> 03:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
your testimony it's been said earlier
 
03:37:11.469 --> 03:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing in this bill that
 
03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
explicitly requires a provider to give
 
03:37:16.870 --> 03:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
the name name or other personally
 
03:37:18.790 --> 03:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
identifiable information to the
 
03:37:20.990 --> 03:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
department but you'll have to excuse me
 
03:37:23.710 --> 03:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
I don't have the current RSA that would
 
03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
be repealed and reenacted in front of me
 
03:37:28.950 --> 03:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
is there any is there any current
 
03:37:33.429 --> 03:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
protection in law that um so for example
 
03:37:35.710 --> 03:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
there was the concern that with a
 
03:37:37.269 --> 03:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
legislation like this even though
 
03:37:39.189 --> 03:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that requires them to do
 
03:37:42.070 --> 03:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
that a provider might actually still be
 
03:37:44.030 --> 03:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
able to voluntarily relinquish that
 
03:37:46.269 --> 03:37:46.279 align:start position:0%
information is there anything in current
 
03:37:48.670 --> 03:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
law that prevents them from doing that
 
03:37:51.229 --> 03:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
now thank you representative uh King for
 
03:37:53.469 --> 03:37:53.479 align:start position:0%
your question I I don't know of anything
 
03:37:55.389 --> 03:37:55.399 align:start position:0%
and I I'm not I'm going to admit I am
 
03:37:57.590 --> 03:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
not a hipa expert but I am not aware of
 
03:37:58.870 --> 03:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
anything in current law that would
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
prevent them from doing so I also
 
03:38:03.189 --> 03:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
believe that the concern is that there
 
03:38:05.950 --> 03:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
are so so there is so much specific
 
03:38:07.710 --> 03:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
sensitive information that is being
 
03:38:09.950 --> 03:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
requested that that that that
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
information could potentially be
 
03:38:13.950 --> 03:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
reidentified even if the name wasn't
 
03:38:15.750 --> 03:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
included thank you thank you
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
03:38:19.830 --> 03:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
03:38:20.950 --> 03:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative King for
 
03:38:23.910 --> 03:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
bearing with me in regards to the issue
 
03:38:26.750 --> 03:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
raised about the state of residence I do
 
03:38:29.229 --> 03:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
understand the concern what are you your
 
03:38:32.670 --> 03:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
thoughts about having it either a
 
03:38:35.590 --> 03:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire or not a
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire so therefore
 
03:38:38.349 --> 03:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
it's not identifying per se of the state
 
03:38:40.030 --> 03:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
but whether it's internal or external to
 
03:38:42.510 --> 03:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
the state thank you representative I
 
03:38:44.389 --> 03:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
mean I would I would have to look at any
 
03:38:46.590 --> 03:38:46.600 align:start position:0%
proposed amended l language to to fully
 
03:38:48.469 --> 03:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
try to understand what the implications
 
03:38:51.630 --> 03:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
might be um I mean I think you've hit on
 
03:38:53.550 --> 03:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
a very important point the fact that
 
03:38:55.590 --> 03:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's actually identifying States makes
 
03:38:58.030 --> 03:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
this particularly concerning given what
 
03:38:59.550 --> 03:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
is happening in other states and the way
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
that they are criminally targeting them
 
03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
um I you know there is still even if you
 
03:39:07.510 --> 03:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
take out the um the state there is still
 
03:39:09.510 --> 03:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
additional very specific information
 
03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
that is requested in the bill as
 
03:39:12.750 --> 03:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
currently drafted so I think that fix
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
alone would not solve the issues um but
 
03:39:16.469 --> 03:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
certainly if there was Amendment
 
03:39:18.670 --> 03:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
language we would be willing to review
 
03:39:22.189 --> 03:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
it representative Weber thank you Mr
 
03:39:25.150 --> 03:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and and to follow up on uh
 
03:39:27.630 --> 03:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
representative meron's
 
03:39:32.710 --> 03:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
observations it would you agree that to
 
03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
Simply identify as instate or out of
 
03:39:38.429 --> 03:39:38.439 align:start position:0%
state would solve a great deal of the
 
03:39:38.439 --> 03:39:39.670 align:start position:0%
state would solve a great deal of the
privacy

03:39:39.670 --> 03:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
03:39:42.670 --> 03:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
issues uh because or or at least those
 
03:39:44.590 --> 03:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
that arise out of somebody who might
 
03:39:47.790 --> 03:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
have traveled from a state uh where
 
03:39:52.070 --> 03:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
where the laws are different but if you
 
03:39:55.630 --> 03:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
then simply say in state or out of state
 
03:39:59.630 --> 03:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
the data isn't very helpful in terms of
 
03:40:03.389 --> 03:40:03.399 align:start position:0%
data because there's no way of
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
determining who has traveled great
 
03:40:09.870 --> 03:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
distances to come for this or who as
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
many people those of us who live in
 
03:40:14.870 --> 03:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
Border towns uh get some of their
 
03:40:16.510 --> 03:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
Healthcare on one side of the river and
 
03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
some of the Healthcare on the other side
 
03:40:20.910 --> 03:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
of the river a lot of people in in
 
03:40:25.429 --> 03:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
eastern Vermont uh come to Dartmouth
 
03:40:27.710 --> 03:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
health for for their medical treatment
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
as As a matter of utter
 
03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
routine uh so would data gathered in
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
that matter manner be useful for any
 
03:40:40.469 --> 03:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
kind of policy analysis well I
 
03:40:41.790 --> 03:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so much for
 
03:40:43.309 --> 03:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
your question and I think that is one
 
03:40:44.910 --> 03:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
that the committee needs to seriously
 
03:40:47.870 --> 03:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
consider we've heard testimony including
 
03:40:50.309 --> 03:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
by DHHS about the serious privacy
 
03:40:52.229 --> 03:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
concerns with the way this bill is
 
03:40:54.790 --> 03:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
written and with this type of uh uh uh
 
03:40:57.309 --> 03:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
data collection system but what is
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
unclear is why are we trying to get this
 
03:41:01.870 --> 03:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
data so if we're going to create the
 
03:41:03.790 --> 03:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
system that creates serious privacy
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
risks to Granite Staters what is the
 
03:41:08.469 --> 03:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
benefit to it and what I am hearing is
 
03:41:11.630 --> 03:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
that this is not information that CDC is
 
03:41:13.630 --> 03:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
requesting that they wouldn't request it
 
03:41:16.429 --> 03:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
in this way and it is far far from clear
 
03:41:20.389 --> 03:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
as to what this um what this data in the
 
03:41:22.030 --> 03:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
specifically in the way that it's being
 
03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
requested here would even be used for
 
03:41:25.309 --> 03:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
and I think those are very important
 
03:41:28.469 --> 03:41:28.479 align:start position:0%
elements for the committee to consider
 
03:41:30.630 --> 03:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
followup and as a
 
03:41:33.309 --> 03:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
followup would you agree with me that
 
03:41:37.269 --> 03:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
looking at all or or most of these data
 
03:41:40.990 --> 03:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
issues that they fall into the same
 
03:41:44.670 --> 03:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
quandry where for data collection
 
03:41:44.680 --> 03:41:45.910 align:start position:0%
quandry where for data collection
purposes

03:41:45.910 --> 03:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
03:41:49.950 --> 03:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
and for policy analys you know for for
 
03:41:53.189 --> 03:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
creating having adequate data to create
 
03:41:55.870 --> 03:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
good policy we need the most specific
 
03:42:00.510 --> 03:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
data possible but that is what provides
 
03:42:02.550 --> 03:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
the most risk to privacy to
 
03:42:06.550 --> 03:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
reidentification to misuse and so the
 
03:42:10.030 --> 03:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
more protections we put for privacy
 
03:42:13.910 --> 03:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
sake the less useful the data is in
 
03:42:16.830 --> 03:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
terms of policy and analysis yes I
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so much for um
 
03:42:21.750 --> 03:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
for putting it in that way and I think
 
03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
you know I would even go a step further
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
and and really think who who do we need
 
03:42:28.510 --> 03:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
this data for policy purposes why are we
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
singling out this medical procedure for
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
data collection and I think the answer
 
03:42:37.429 --> 03:42:37.439 align:start position:0%

I'm the executive director at the
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
lovering health center in Greenland New
 
03:43:29.830 --> 03:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we are an independent
 
03:43:32.030 --> 03:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit Health Center with over 43
 
03:43:33.830 --> 03:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
years of experience providing abortion
 
03:43:35.950 --> 03:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
care in New Hampshire we're one of the
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
reproductive Healthcare facilities
 
03:43:39.630 --> 03:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
directly impacted by you move the
 
03:43:42.510 --> 03:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
microphone closer to you please of
 
03:43:45.070 --> 03:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
course so we are one of the healthcare
 
03:43:46.750 --> 03:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
facili is directly impacted by Senate
 
03:43:46.760 --> 03:43:47.950 align:start position:0%
facili is directly impacted by Senate
Bill

03:43:47.950 --> 03:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:43:50.229 --> 03:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
461 I want to note that the lovering
 
03:43:52.030 --> 03:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
health center voluntarily reports
 
03:43:53.990 --> 03:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
abortion data to two national
 
03:43:56.590 --> 03:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
organizations the gut marer Institute
 
03:43:58.389 --> 03:43:58.399 align:start position:0%
and the National Abortion
 
03:44:00.750 --> 03:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
Federation we are opposed however to
 
03:44:03.870 --> 03:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 461 for important
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
reasons Senate Bill 461 requires
 
03:44:08.670 --> 03:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
reporting abortion data with no clear
 
03:44:11.469 --> 03:44:11.479 align:start position:0%
intent to positively impact public
 
03:44:14.469 --> 03:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
health so when we consider as a Health
 
03:44:17.309 --> 03:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
Center and a facility the risks that
 
03:44:19.790 --> 03:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
data sharing could pose to our patients
 
03:44:22.429 --> 03:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
and to our facility and to our providers
 
03:44:25.269 --> 03:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
if we had a clear indication of what the
 
03:44:27.510 --> 03:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
public health impact of that data could
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
be we would be collaboratively hopefully
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
collaboratively designing a system to
 
03:44:35.429 --> 03:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
achieve that purpose that's not what
 
03:44:38.149 --> 03:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
happened in this proposed amendment that
 
03:44:40.389 --> 03:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
sits in front of you today I appreciate
 
03:44:41.910 --> 03:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
that your questions indicate you're
 
03:44:43.990 --> 03:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
willing to critically consider what this
 
03:44:47.229 --> 03:44:47.239 align:start position:0%
amendment can contains uh but there
 
03:44:50.309 --> 03:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
still is no clear discussion about what
 
03:44:52.670 --> 03:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
the public health impact the positive
 
03:44:54.710 --> 03:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
public health impact would
 
03:44:57.229 --> 03:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
be so we have shared historically a
 
03:44:59.790 --> 03:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
commitment with DHHS and bipartisan
 
03:45:02.229 --> 03:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
legislators um to improving Public
 
03:45:04.389 --> 03:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
Health but most notably as partners in
 
03:45:06.830 --> 03:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
the title 10 Family Planning program the
 
03:45:09.030 --> 03:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
defunding of Family Planning contracts
 
03:45:10.750 --> 03:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
for the Levering and contracts for all
 
03:45:12.510 --> 03:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire abortion providers over
 
03:45:14.670 --> 03:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
the last three years sends a very clear
 
03:45:14.680 --> 03:45:15.790 align:start position:0%
the last three years sends a very clear
message

03:45:15.790 --> 03:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
message
 
03:45:18.030 --> 03:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
it signals that this is not the time
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
when we can expect abortion data or more
 
03:45:23.110 --> 03:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
detailed abortion data to have any
 
03:45:25.189 --> 03:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
impact on rebuilding the successful
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
Family Planning Network that achieved
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
the lowest teenage unintended pregnancy
 
03:45:30.510 --> 03:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
rate in the country and a Family
 
03:45:32.750 --> 03:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
Planning Network across the state that
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
would naturally and effectively impact
 
03:45:38.189 --> 03:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
and reduce abortion rates abortion does
 
03:45:40.229 --> 03:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
not exist outside and separate from
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
other public health initiatives it's not
 
03:45:45.149 --> 03:45:45.159 align:start position:0%
an other in the healthcare Spectrum if
 
03:45:46.790 --> 03:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
abortion data was essential to New
 
03:45:48.469 --> 03:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Current public health
 
03:45:50.910 --> 03:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
initiatives it could already be obtained
 
03:45:53.469 --> 03:45:53.479 align:start position:0%
from public sources obtaining abortion
 
03:45:56.229 --> 03:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
data using Senate Bill 461 as amended is
 
03:45:59.630 --> 03:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
a want not a need and I see it as an
 
03:46:02.189 --> 03:46:02.199 align:start position:0%
opportunistic intentional overreach with
 
03:46:04.189 --> 03:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
potential harmful
 
03:46:07.389 --> 03:46:07.399 align:start position:0%
impacts Senate Bill 461 has no funding
 
03:46:09.429 --> 03:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
attached to create secure adequately
 
03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
managed and maintain reporting systems
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's unreasonable to ask providers and
 
03:46:15.670 --> 03:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
Facilities to report data without
 
03:46:17.309 --> 03:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
adequate cyber security and data
 
03:46:20.510 --> 03:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
management capacity Senate Bill 461
 
03:46:22.670 --> 03:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
allows for significant subjectivity in
 
03:46:24.790 --> 03:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
the interpretation of vital language
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
which folks before me have testified to
 
03:46:28.269 --> 03:46:28.279 align:start position:0%
and I have heard you consider
 
03:46:31.269 --> 03:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully thank you for that but
 
03:46:33.510 --> 03:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
absent details about specific elements
 
03:46:35.269 --> 03:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
required and addressing the concerns
 
03:46:36.790 --> 03:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
that have already been presented to you
 
03:46:39.389 --> 03:46:39.399 align:start position:0%
today we cannot support Senate Bill
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
461 this bill also requires reporting a
 
03:46:44.070 --> 03:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
patient's state of residence with no
 
03:46:47.070 --> 03:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
Shield law place to protect providers or
 
03:46:49.550 --> 03:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
patients in New Hampshire in this post
 
03:46:51.830 --> 03:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
row National landscape and considering
 
03:46:53.630 --> 03:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
the current New Hampshire landscape the
 
03:46:55.630 --> 03:46:55.640 align:start position:0%
timing and the structure of Senate Bill
 
03:46:58.309 --> 03:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
461 pose a threat to both providers and
 
03:46:59.870 --> 03:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
patients you could start wrapping up
 
03:47:02.309 --> 03:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
please yes the data that's being
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
requested is being requested at the same
 
03:47:06.229 --> 03:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
time that multiple States as we've heard
 
03:47:07.870 --> 03:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
with abortion bands are just beginning
 
03:47:10.269 --> 03:47:10.279 align:start position:0%
to exercise their right to pursue and or
 
03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
prosecute leg uh providers and patients
 
03:47:15.309 --> 03:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
who obtain abortion care with legal

the legislators who proposed this bill
 
03:47:21.510 --> 03:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
cannot safely say there is no path to
 
03:47:23.790 --> 03:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
identifying patients and or pursuing
 
03:47:26.309 --> 03:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
providers and this risk is unacceptable
 
03:47:26.319 --> 03:47:27.110 align:start position:0%
providers and this risk is unacceptable
thank

03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:47:32.110 --> 03:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:34.149 --> 03:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you very much for your
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and thank you for taking my
 
03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
question I I wanted to just ask a quick
 
03:47:42.670 --> 03:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
followup uh about the statement about uh
 
03:47:46.189 --> 03:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
the public health aspects of um having
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
any impact on rebuilding the successful
 
03:47:50.469 --> 03:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
Family Planning Network that achieved
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
the lowest teenage unintended pregnancy
 
03:47:55.870 --> 03:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
rate in the country since the defunding
 
03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
of Planned Parenthood in the centers has
 
03:48:02.750 --> 03:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
our place in in the national rankings
 
03:48:04.870 --> 03:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
changed unfortunately I'll have to defer
 
03:48:05.950 --> 03:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
that question to the Department of
 
03:48:07.469 --> 03:48:07.479 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services who would have
 
03:48:10.229 --> 03:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
that data yeah thank
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
you other questions representative
 
03:48:12.359 --> 03:48:15.389 align:start position:0%
you other questions representative
Merchant

03:48:15.389 --> 03:48:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:17.229 --> 03:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank for taking the
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking at the first
 
03:48:23.229 --> 03:48:23.239 align:start position:0%
paragraph and in that first paragraph
 
03:48:24.790 --> 03:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
the third line it
 
03:48:27.710 --> 03:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
says lovering voluntarily reports
 
03:48:29.309 --> 03:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
abortion data to two national
 
03:48:32.110 --> 03:48:32.120 align:start position:0%
organizations GM Institute in the
 
03:48:34.389 --> 03:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
National Abortion Federation can you
 
03:48:36.149 --> 03:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
share with us what those data elements
 
03:48:37.710 --> 03:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
are that being
 
03:48:37.720 --> 03:48:39.269 align:start position:0%
are that being
reported

03:48:39.269 --> 03:48:39.279 align:start position:0%
reported
 
03:48:41.990 --> 03:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely so the reported elements that
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
we submit are aggregated into Statewide
 
03:48:48.670 --> 03:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
data which is an important component of
 
03:48:51.389 --> 03:48:51.399 align:start position:0%
why we report to these two uh
 
03:48:54.189 --> 03:48:54.199 align:start position:0%
organizations is because it is it is not
 
03:48:58.269 --> 03:48:58.279 align:start position:0%
reported publicly as facility specific
 
03:49:00.389 --> 03:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
data it is aggregated into Statewide
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
data so there's benefit and there's
 
03:49:04.590 --> 03:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
certainly privacy protection in that
 
03:49:07.550 --> 03:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
process we report the number so the
 
03:49:10.189 --> 03:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
volume of abortions that we provide and
 
03:49:14.750 --> 03:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
we also report the method as defined by
 
03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
either procedural or completely managed
 
03:49:16.960 --> 03:49:17.750 align:start position:0%
either procedural or completely managed
with

03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:49:22.269 --> 03:49:22.279 align:start position:0%
medications and that is what we provide
 
03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr
 
03:49:27.950 --> 03:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
chair would then would you be opposed to
 
03:49:30.189 --> 03:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
that data also going to the state
 
03:49:32.429 --> 03:49:32.439 align:start position:0%
database if we're just basically sending
 
03:49:34.189 --> 03:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
it to two national organizations could
 
03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
we therefore send that kind of data to
 
03:49:40.309 --> 03:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
the state so the state would have that
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:47.870 --> 03:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
I feel that the state can access that
 
03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
data if they want aggregate data it's
 
03:49:51.870 --> 03:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
available it's available at the GOP
 
03:49:53.630 --> 03:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
marker Institute website today so you
 
03:49:55.229 --> 03:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
can see what the estimated volume of
 
03:49:56.590 --> 03:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
abortions provided in the state of New
 
03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are today um and I would say
 
03:50:02.950 --> 03:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
that without the secure systems that we
 
03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
would expect and confirmation of what
 
03:50:07.149 --> 03:50:07.159 align:start position:0%
the public reporting would look like and
 
03:50:08.950 --> 03:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
that it would be aggregated not
 
03:50:10.870 --> 03:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
identified by facility those would be
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
important elements for us to ensure part
 
03:50:15.469 --> 03:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
of the legislation if it's proposed post
 
03:50:17.670 --> 03:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
now the followup thank you Mr
 
03:50:20.710 --> 03:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
chair in regards to the data going to
 
03:50:23.670 --> 03:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
these two organizations and its
 
03:50:25.870 --> 03:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
aggregated and you talked about the fact
 
03:50:27.950 --> 03:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
that in the state of New Hampshire are
 
03:50:29.910 --> 03:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
you talking about multiple locations in
 
03:50:32.429 --> 03:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire sending data to the gut
 
03:50:34.429 --> 03:50:34.439 align:start position:0%
marker Institute versus doing it
 
03:50:36.349 --> 03:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
individually TR trying to follow what
 
03:50:37.710 --> 03:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
your folks are doing and if that's the
 
03:50:40.790 --> 03:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
case is it mandatory or is it voluntary
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
because part of the data in here in the
 
03:50:44.670 --> 03:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
bills it shall be done versus it may be
 
03:50:47.469 --> 03:50:47.479 align:start position:0%
be done yes so it is voluntary data
 
03:50:49.670 --> 03:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
reporting is voluntary at this point
 
03:50:53.110 --> 03:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
although um I believe if you wanted to
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
verify with the G mocker Institute how
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
they if they believe their data is
 
03:50:58.269 --> 03:50:58.279 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and reflective of activity
 
03:50:59.950 --> 03:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire the answer
 
03:51:02.349 --> 03:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:05.429 --> 03:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
yes and the second part of your question
 
03:51:08.550 --> 03:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
um I have concerns
 
03:51:10.469 --> 03:51:10.479 align:start position:0%
about which I didn't mention in my
 
03:51:12.349 --> 03:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
testimony but I do have concerns about
 
03:51:15.630 --> 03:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of the word shall so I'm
 
03:51:20.189 --> 03:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about how you validate the
 
03:51:22.750 --> 03:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
data I Supply you or any facility
 
03:51:24.510 --> 03:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
supplies to the Department of Health and
 
03:51:27.510 --> 03:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
Human Services with an unfunded
 
03:51:29.950 --> 03:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
unstaffed um mandate is how do you
 
03:51:33.070 --> 03:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
validate that data without accessing
 
03:51:36.309 --> 03:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
Private health information and so if the
 
03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
data that we are supplying
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
voluntarily is considered inadequate in
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
some way I would ask how do you ensure
 
03:51:45.710 --> 03:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
this legisl that the data we're
 
03:51:48.349 --> 03:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
supplying is adequate to you and that's
 
03:51:50.189 --> 03:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
a fundamental concern that I
 
03:51:53.590 --> 03:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
have representative Leon uh thank you Mr
 
03:51:56.110 --> 03:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here um
 
03:51:58.110 --> 03:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
I looked at the gut marcker Institute
 
03:52:00.349 --> 03:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
and all I saw was a bar graph where it
 
03:52:03.750 --> 03:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
was on a 5,000 scale so trying to have
 
03:52:05.670 --> 03:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
an understanding of what the actual data
 
03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
are in New Hampshire was essentially
 
03:52:10.870 --> 03:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
impossible um I don't know if that's
 
03:52:13.189 --> 03:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
available more granularly and you said
 
03:52:15.710 --> 03:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
that it is a vol voluntary is this all
 
03:52:17.070 --> 03:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
of the abortions that are happening in
 
03:52:18.790 --> 03:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or just those which are
 
03:52:20.750 --> 03:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
chosen to be re
 
03:52:22.830 --> 03:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
reported uh because it's voluntary it's
 
03:52:24.429 --> 03:52:24.439 align:start position:0%
those that are chosen to be reported
 
03:52:28.229 --> 03:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
however uh our understanding and my
 
03:52:29.950 --> 03:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it's fairly
 
03:52:31.149 --> 03:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
accurately reflection of what's
 
03:52:32.349 --> 03:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
happening in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:52:35.910 --> 03:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
there is a state specific map uh through
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
the GP marker Institute that is
 
03:52:40.229 --> 03:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
available um uh that does become more
 
03:52:42.990 --> 03:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
granular so I would encourage you to
 
03:52:44.670 --> 03:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
Simply explore that website perhaps some
 
03:52:47.469 --> 03:52:47.479 align:start position:0%
more detail but there is an abortion map
 
03:52:49.030 --> 03:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
that covers not only the state of the
 
03:52:50.910 --> 03:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
legislation in the state but also the
 
03:52:52.630 --> 03:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
volume of abortions provided in more
 
03:52:56.149 --> 03:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
detail follow um thank you um so as I
 
03:52:57.990 --> 03:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
clicked into the state and I went to the
 
03:53:00.149 --> 03:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
data on New Hampshire it was a bar graph
 
03:53:02.670 --> 03:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
measured on the 5,000 granularity
 
03:53:04.510 --> 03:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's something else but if so
 
03:53:06.309 --> 03:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's pretty hard to find in there my
 
03:53:09.269 --> 03:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
other question is um do you uh take all
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
the information within the state and
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
then send it to G marer or do each of
 
03:53:14.830 --> 03:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
the individual providers their
 
03:53:16.830 --> 03:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
information individual providers send
 
03:53:23.149 --> 03:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:28.030 --> 03:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Kaya mon
 
03:53:45.630 --> 03:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:47.510 --> 03:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
you've asked for two
 
03:53:50.309 --> 03:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
minutes yes good afternoon members of
 
03:53:51.389 --> 03:53:51.399 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Kayla
 
03:53:52.790 --> 03:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
Montgomery I'm the vice president of
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
public affairs for Planned Parent of
 
03:53:56.110 --> 03:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
Northern New England and Planned Parent
 
03:53:58.830 --> 03:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire action fund um we have
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
testified on background on this bill for
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
a number of years in front of this
 
03:54:05.790 --> 03:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
committee and we continue to express
 
03:54:07.950 --> 03:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
that we are fine with the collection of
 
03:54:10.830 --> 03:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
abortion statistics if done securely and
 
03:54:13.710 --> 03:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of legitimate EP
 
03:54:15.750 --> 03:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
epidemiologic iCal purposes as we can
 
03:54:18.269 --> 03:54:18.279 align:start position:0%
all agree that good data equals better
 
03:54:21.550 --> 03:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
Public Health outcomes now PPN and our
 
03:54:23.429 --> 03:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
four Health Centers here in New
 
03:54:25.469 --> 03:54:25.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are nonprofit healthc care
 
03:54:27.309 --> 03:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
providers who follow all state and
 
03:54:29.469 --> 03:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
federal laws and if this bill were to
 
03:54:31.670 --> 03:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
pass we would most certainly comply um
 
03:54:33.870 --> 03:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
but we do have a few concerns so many
 
03:54:35.590 --> 03:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
things have already been addressed so I
 
03:54:38.590 --> 03:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
will try and keep this brief um there
 
03:54:41.229 --> 03:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
was already a robust discussion around
 
03:54:43.149 --> 03:54:43.159 align:start position:0%
um how concerns around how this
 
03:54:45.870 --> 03:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
information could be used in postr World
 
03:54:47.710 --> 03:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
um so I will just say that that's also a
 
03:54:49.950 --> 03:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
concern for us well New Hampshire
 
03:54:51.630 --> 03:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any shield laws in place
 
03:54:53.189 --> 03:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
and we I think we can all agree that
 
03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
nobody would want any of this
 
03:54:58.670 --> 03:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
information weaponized or used um
 
03:55:00.469 --> 03:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
against the state of New Hampshire or
 
03:55:02.349 --> 03:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
against any patients who are coming to
 
03:55:02.359 --> 03:55:03.110 align:start position:0%
against any patients who are coming to
our

03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:55:06.149 --> 03:55:06.159 align:start position:0%
state um we talked a little bit about
 
03:55:09.070 --> 03:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
gutmacher Institute uh we at Planned
 
03:55:10.710 --> 03:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
Parenthood Northern New England we also
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
provide information and uh data to The
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
gutmacher Institute um this is linked in
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
my um testimony um anyone can go online
 
03:55:21.790 --> 03:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
and look at that information uh they
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
collect aggregate data so there's no
 
03:55:26.750 --> 03:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
risk to patients or providers and we
 
03:55:29.229 --> 03:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
have been working with them for decades
 
03:55:31.189 --> 03:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh we have full trust in how they're
 
03:55:33.389 --> 03:55:33.399 align:start position:0%
using their data and that it is being
 
03:55:35.830 --> 03:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
used for good Public Health outcomes so
 
03:55:37.110 --> 03:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
that is certainly something we will
 
03:55:38.910 --> 03:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
continue we will continue to work with
 
03:55:41.710 --> 03:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
them um and uh continue to provide
 
03:55:44.910 --> 03:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
information to them um one that hasn't
 
03:55:48.110 --> 03:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
been discussed yet is uh the section
 
03:55:50.790 --> 03:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
that says uh any prescriptions written
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of inducing abortion um
 
03:55:56.189 --> 03:55:56.199 align:start position:0%
this is a a place that would great it
 
03:55:57.429 --> 03:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
would be good to see a little bit of
 
03:55:59.990 --> 03:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
clarity uh in this line because I
 
03:56:02.670 --> 03:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
believe the intent of that line is to
 
03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
determine whether an abortion is
 
03:56:08.670 --> 03:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
medication or procedure um and if that's
 
03:56:10.309 --> 03:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
the case it should probably just say
 
03:56:12.550 --> 03:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
that because as it is written it's a
 
03:56:14.990 --> 03:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
little bit confusing of what would be
 
03:56:16.670 --> 03:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
required of us to
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
report um prescription medication is
 
03:56:23.030 --> 03:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
really specific to the individual so
 
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's unclear if we would have to list
 
03:56:26.590 --> 03:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
say the names or the doses or the
 
03:56:29.149 --> 03:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
quantity for each patient and that type
 
03:56:31.389 --> 03:56:31.399 align:start position:0%
of data collection is really more about
 
03:56:33.790 --> 03:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
individualized medical care and it's not
 
03:56:37.510 --> 03:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
a vital statistic so that's one area um
 
03:56:40.790 --> 03:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
that needs some clarity and uh DHHS
 
03:56:43.790 --> 03:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
already talked about this but I just um
 
03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
I also o want to reiterate it because uh
 
03:56:48.110 --> 03:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's probably the most pressing
 
03:56:49.429 --> 03:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
thing for Planned Parenthood at the
 
03:56:51.550 --> 03:56:51.560 align:start position:0%
moment is that this bill doesn't address
 
03:56:54.309 --> 03:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
the method of how this data is collected
 
03:56:56.950 --> 03:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
so we see in lots of other states there
 
03:56:59.670 --> 03:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
is a secure online portal for instance
 
03:57:02.389 --> 03:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
in Maine you know that is a PPN an e
 
03:57:04.229 --> 03:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
State we go in and we enter the data
 
03:57:06.309 --> 03:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
through our secure online portal but
 
03:57:09.229 --> 03:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
it's not specified here uh if we would
 
03:57:13.110 --> 03:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
have to fill this out daily um where do
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
we do it do we fax the form do we mail
 
03:57:17.389 --> 03:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
it do we walk it over to the
 
03:57:19.469 --> 03:57:19.479 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office uh it's not
 
03:57:22.189 --> 03:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
specified and it it also isn't specified
 
03:57:24.349 --> 03:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
the Cadence of the collection it says at
 
03:57:26.269 --> 03:57:26.279 align:start position:0%
least annually or as reported by the
 
03:57:27.790 --> 03:57:27.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner you could start wrapping up
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
please sure so that could mean daily and
 
03:57:31.349 --> 03:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
the reason that this is really pressing
 
03:57:34.590 --> 03:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
is because there is an immediate um date
 
03:57:36.510 --> 03:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill so we would have to figure
 
03:57:39.910 --> 03:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
out those Logistics right away um so in
 
03:57:43.309 --> 03:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
closing if um the legislature decides uh
 
03:57:45.030 --> 03:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
a formal collection of abortion data in
 
03:57:46.750 --> 03:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for clear and specific
 
03:57:48.670 --> 03:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
Public Health purposes they should
 
03:57:50.429 --> 03:57:50.439 align:start position:0%
present a detailed method of secure
 
03:57:52.550 --> 03:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
collection and we certainly understand
 
03:57:54.630 --> 03:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
the concept of this bill but with roie
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
Wade overturned and the reproductive
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
healthc care landscape and complete
 
03:58:00.670 --> 03:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
chaos in this country the New Hampshire
 
03:58:02.670 --> 03:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
legislature should take every precaution
 
03:58:04.389 --> 03:58:04.399 align:start position:0%
to protect abortion providers and
 
03:58:06.990 --> 03:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
patients privacy in the granite state
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Seth
 
03:58:11.030 --> 03:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:58:13.510 --> 03:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
your testimony um you briefly mentioned
 
03:58:16.630 --> 03:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
Maine and it sounded like you spoke of
 
03:58:18.670 --> 03:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
it in a positive light uh the
 
03:58:20.990 --> 03:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
information you give in Maine uh you
 
03:58:24.550 --> 03:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
seem fairly happy with can you tell me
 
03:58:24.560 --> 03:58:25.389 align:start position:0%
seem fairly happy with can you tell me
what

03:58:25.389 --> 03:58:25.399 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:58:28.349 --> 03:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
information is required to be given in
 
03:58:31.389 --> 03:58:31.399 align:start position:0%
Maine and and juxtapose that with what
 
03:58:34.189 --> 03:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
is being asked to be required in this
 
03:58:36.309 --> 03:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
bill is there anything in this bill that
 
03:58:38.670 --> 03:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
is required but is not in main or vice
 
03:58:41.670 --> 03:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
versa sure so the state of Main and I
 
03:58:43.349 --> 03:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
I'm using main as example because it's a
 
03:58:44.510 --> 03:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
state that I work in and so I'm
 
03:58:46.910 --> 03:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it but um Maine has
 
03:58:50.229 --> 03:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
like a state specific CDC um which is a
 
03:58:52.870 --> 03:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
part which is a division of their Public
 
03:58:55.110 --> 03:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
Health um so it's an entire you know
 
03:58:57.349 --> 03:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
hippoc compliant website that's already
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
in existence and the information that
 
03:59:02.750 --> 03:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
they ask um they actually used to ask a
 
03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
lot more specific information they used
 
03:59:07.110 --> 03:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
to ask about education and about race of
 
03:59:09.189 --> 03:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
the patient they have since um taken
 
03:59:13.750 --> 03:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
that away um but it is uh it is a system
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
that is in place that there's a lot of
 
03:59:18.550 --> 03:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
confidence with abortion providers that
 
03:59:21.670 --> 03:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
the information is secure follow up
 
03:59:24.670 --> 03:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
follow up do you know or recall if they
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
asked for the date and place of the
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
abortions performed in the age of the
 
03:59:28.680 --> 03:59:29.710 align:start position:0%
abortions performed in the age of the
pregnant

and I am here today to ask the committee
 
04:01:08.990 --> 04:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
to oppose Senate Bill 461 Senate Bill
 
04:01:12.550 --> 04:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
461 is risky for patients with no
 
04:01:16.110 --> 04:01:16.120 align:start position:0%
benefits Senate Bill 461 proposes such
 
04:01:18.070 --> 04:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
detailed data collection that an
 
04:01:20.590 --> 04:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
individual patient could be traced to an
 
04:01:23.630 --> 04:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
individual clinic or procedure these
 
04:01:26.389 --> 04:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
details include the patient's age the
 
04:01:29.070 --> 04:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
date and collection of the procedure the
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
state of residence of the patient
 
04:01:34.750 --> 04:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
gestational age of the patient and any
 
04:01:37.229 --> 04:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
prescriptions written for the purpose of
 
04:01:40.429 --> 04:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
inducing an abortion as a scientist and
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
a researcher I love data but for every
 
04:01:46.349 --> 04:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
data Point collected there should be a
 
04:01:48.750 --> 04:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
justification the justification should
 
04:01:51.269 --> 04:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
explain the reason for each data point
 
04:01:53.590 --> 04:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
and the contribution that that data
 
04:01:56.590 --> 04:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
point will make to an individual or
 
04:01:59.870 --> 04:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
Society Senate Bill 461 puts patient
 
04:02:02.670 --> 04:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
privacy at risk yet the benefits of this
 
04:02:04.590 --> 04:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
data collection are not stated in the
 
04:02:07.950 --> 04:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
bill in fact in the proposed Senate Bill
 
04:02:11.590 --> 04:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
461 there are no benefits to patients or
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
to the people of New Hampshire the risk
 
04:02:16.870 --> 04:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
RK of data breach intentionally or
 
04:02:19.550 --> 04:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
unintentionally puts at Great potential
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
harm those who have contributed the data
 
04:02:25.830 --> 04:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
to this data set as I spent time
 
04:02:27.550 --> 04:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
understanding this bill some questions
 
04:02:30.309 --> 04:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
came to mind what are the benefits of
 
04:02:32.189 --> 04:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
mandating this data
 
04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
collection who will benefit from this
 
04:02:37.510 --> 04:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
data what are the benefits of sharing
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
this private data with the general court
 
04:02:41.550 --> 04:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
of the State of New
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire overall there are often
 
04:02:46.349 --> 04:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of data
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
collection we all have seen examples of
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
that the collection of individual
 
04:02:54.550 --> 04:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
patient data related to their abortion
 
04:02:57.710 --> 04:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
is risky to patients and I urge you to
 
04:03:00.910 --> 04:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%

04:03:30.870 --> 04:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
amendment without a real clear purpose
 
04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
that exposes patients to unnecessary
 
04:03:36.990 --> 04:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
risk for unclear benefit that I think
 
04:03:39.469 --> 04:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
poses a burden upon healthc care
 
04:03:42.870 --> 04:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
providers again with no understanding of
 
04:03:47.309 --> 04:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
why and finally uh does expose my
 
04:03:49.269 --> 04:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
providers and other providers in the
 
04:03:51.469 --> 04:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to significant
 
04:03:53.710 --> 04:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
Peril in light of many of the points
 
04:03:55.790 --> 04:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
that the speakers ahead of me have
 
04:03:59.429 --> 04:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
suggested uh with regards to the uh
 
04:04:02.469 --> 04:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
current uh sort of State the current uh
 
04:04:07.750 --> 04:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
map of uh of access to abortion care uh
 
04:04:09.670 --> 04:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
which could have significant Downstream
 
04:04:12.309 --> 04:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
consequences to our ability to have
 
04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
adequate providers in the state of New
 
04:04:16.990 --> 04:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to care for granite
 
04:04:20.070 --> 04:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
Staters I am happy to take any questions
 
04:04:23.790 --> 04:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
but can assure the uh group today that
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
this would this data collected in its
 
04:04:29.950 --> 04:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
current uh iteration I think there is
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
very significant risk posed even with
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
the consideration as suggested by some
 
04:04:37.750 --> 04:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
of removing the state uh is an
 
04:04:39.790 --> 04:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
individual in state or out of state I
 
04:04:41.830 --> 04:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
think there is still significant uh
 
04:04:45.790 --> 04:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
Peril given the uh inevitable uh you
 
04:04:47.590 --> 04:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
know artificial intelligence and or
 
04:04:51.030 --> 04:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
ability to uh kind of collocate data I
 
04:04:52.590 --> 04:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
think all of us have experienced this
 
04:04:54.030 --> 04:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
when we've innocently done a Google
 
04:04:56.590 --> 04:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
search on a particular trip to a
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
particular place and then suddenly we
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
are targeted thereafter with cookies and
 
04:05:02.670 --> 04:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
the like and without any provision for
 
04:05:04.710 --> 04:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
who is collecting this data what are the
 
04:05:07.550 --> 04:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place to really lock that
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
down uh and again with no clear benefit
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
in mind I think this exposes my
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
providers at risk I think this exposes
 
04:05:18.630 --> 04:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
patients to risk and I think It
 
04:05:20.590 --> 04:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately exposes the people of the
 
04:05:22.910 --> 04:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
Granite State to risk this is a slippery
 
04:05:25.389 --> 04:05:25.399 align:start position:0%
slope and I would urge that we strike
 
04:05:27.229 --> 04:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
down uh Senate Bill
 
04:05:29.750 --> 04:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
461 thank you representative
 
04:05:32.910 --> 04:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:05:35.149 --> 04:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question could you
 
04:05:38.229 --> 04:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
give an example of the type of perel
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
that might be
 
04:05:44.990 --> 04:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
um that might occur to uh a provider an
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
abortion provider um in New Hampshire if
 
04:05:51.950 --> 04:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
as a result of this kind of data
 
04:05:55.030 --> 04:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
collection and data reporting absolutely
 
04:05:57.590 --> 04:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
so let me give a a the first example
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
which at this point would be absent The
 
04:06:01.830 --> 04:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
Shield law that you've heard many people
 
04:06:04.830 --> 04:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
allude to if one of our providers in the
 
04:06:06.630 --> 04:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire were to
 
04:06:08.950 --> 04:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
administer services to a patient who
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
comes from a state where that uh
 
04:06:14.349 --> 04:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
provision of care is illegal in some
 
04:06:16.990 --> 04:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
scenarios that provider if that could
 
04:06:19.269 --> 04:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
actually be traced to the provider which
 
04:06:21.790 --> 04:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
I would submit to the group is feasible
 
04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
very much feasible in the context of the
 
04:06:27.870 --> 04:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
current uh uh Bill Amendment um that
 
04:06:29.990 --> 04:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
provider could potentially be subject to
 
04:06:32.990 --> 04:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
legal action uh revoking their license
 
04:06:37.070 --> 04:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
um Jail uh at in the state of origin uh
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
where that patient came from more
 
04:06:41.189 --> 04:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
proximally however I would submit to you
 
04:06:44.269 --> 04:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
that there are uh certainly individuals
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
who who would use this information if it
 
04:06:48.990 --> 04:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
could be traced to a specific provider
 
04:06:51.910 --> 04:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
to um Target that provider to Target the
 
04:06:54.269 --> 04:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
place where that abortion was provided
 
04:06:56.389 --> 04:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh placing both patients other patients
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
who come to seek care from that facility
 
04:07:01.630 --> 04:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
as well as the provider in Peril and
 
04:07:04.349 --> 04:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
then again it's not a far-fetched uh
 
04:07:06.149 --> 04:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
conclusion that they could figure out
 
04:07:08.070 --> 04:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
where my provider lives or a provider
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
who who offered these services and they
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
could find that person at home with
 
04:07:13.950 --> 04:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
their families so all of this is
 
04:07:15.950 --> 04:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
feasible and there is precedent for
 
04:07:17.590 --> 04:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
every scenario I've just
 
04:07:17.600 --> 04:07:19.590 align:start position:0%
every scenario I've just
outlined

04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
outlined
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um when these kind of
 
04:07:25.109 --> 04:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
bills have come up in the past I've been
 
04:07:27.790 --> 04:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
contacted by a
 
04:07:31.469 --> 04:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
constituent whose uncle was a physician
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
abortion provider I think in Buffalo or
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
around Buffalo who was shot and killed
 
04:07:42.510 --> 04:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
so are you also concerned about violence
 
04:07:46.309 --> 04:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
um affect ing yourself or providers in
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
your practice I'm absolutely concerned
 
04:07:50.349 --> 04:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
about that I mean I don't need to remind
 
04:07:52.630 --> 04:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
you of the terrible episode we had uh
 
04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
with a with an Irate family member who
 
04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
came and and shot one of our providers
 
04:07:59.309 --> 04:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth some years ago admittedly
 
04:08:01.950 --> 04:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
different circumstances but all of this
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
has happened before um every single
 
04:08:06.670 --> 04:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
month we read about you know some irate
 
04:08:08.269 --> 04:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
individual who shows up on the doorstep
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
of a medical center provoked by whatever
 
04:08:12.790 --> 04:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
reason I think this just gives another
 
04:08:14.189 --> 04:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
piece of Amun
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
to those individuals and places our
 
04:08:18.910 --> 04:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
healthare system both patients and
 
04:08:20.109 --> 04:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
providers in
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:26.030 --> 04:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none representa for the
 
04:08:27.950 --> 04:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
record I will be submitting um written
 
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
testimony from one of our other
 
04:08:30.790 --> 04:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
providers Dr Amy Paris who's the
 
04:08:32.910 --> 04:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
director of Family Planning and OBGYN
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
research so that will come around okay
 
04:08:41.510 --> 04:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:44.269 --> 04:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
all also signed up to speak is Jason
 
04:08:52.030 --> 04:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:57.510 --> 04:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:00.790 --> 04:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
sir am I on now y awesome thank you Mr
 
04:09:03.109 --> 04:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
chair uh for the record my name is Jason
 
04:09:04.670 --> 04:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
Hennessy I president of New Hampshire
 
04:09:06.389 --> 04:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
right to life I also have some
 
04:09:08.030 --> 04:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
experience that might be pertinent to
 
04:09:09.870 --> 04:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
this I played a leadership role as part
 
04:09:12.269 --> 04:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
of a national epidemiology study and one
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
of my responsibilities was overseeing
 
04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
the compliance of the medical data that
 
04:09:17.550 --> 04:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
we collected with Federal privacy rules
 
04:09:19.630 --> 04:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
I as a researcher I also published novel
 
04:09:21.870 --> 04:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
research and privacy in uh
 
04:09:24.750 --> 04:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
internationally peer-reviewed
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
forms one thing I want to just point out
 
04:09:28.830 --> 04:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
is that according to G marcker which is
 
04:09:32.189 --> 04:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
a uh pro-abortion research group 46
 
04:09:34.630 --> 04:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
States and the wa and the and Washington
 
04:09:39.309 --> 04:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
requirements so right now the fact is
 
04:09:44.030 --> 04:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
that the only people who have this data
 
04:09:46.109 --> 04:09:46.119 align:start position:0%
are the private providers themselves
 
04:09:47.550 --> 04:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
they release it when it meets their
 
04:09:49.990 --> 04:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
interests and don't release it when it
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't and you can you can understand
 
04:09:54.030 --> 04:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
why in a competitive industry you would
 
04:09:55.550 --> 04:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
want to keep that data
 
04:09:58.149 --> 04:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
private but I I I submit to you that the
 
04:10:00.630 --> 04:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
legislature and the public needs this
 
04:10:03.149 --> 04:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
data so for instance how do we know how
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
safe abortion is in New Hampshire I've
 
04:10:06.590 --> 04:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
seen on a lot of promotional materials
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
that abortion is safe inlegal New
 
04:10:10.950 --> 04:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how do we know we have no data
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
the people who have the data they
 
04:10:14.469 --> 04:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
they're not going to share it if it's if
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't meet their interests there's
 
04:10:18.349 --> 04:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
been a lot of uh there's been a lot of
 
04:10:19.349 --> 04:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
students around the fetal Life
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
protection act over the last couple of
 
04:10:22.630 --> 04:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
years in terms of how many late term
 
04:10:24.630 --> 04:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
abortions have happened how many haven't
 
04:10:26.750 --> 04:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have any data because there's
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
no data
 
04:10:32.710 --> 04:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
collection uh so the qu so the question
 
04:10:34.990 --> 04:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
is uh do we already do this and the
 
04:10:36.670 --> 04:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
answer is we already collect a lot of
 
04:10:38.910 --> 04:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
personal data I'll draw your attention
 
04:10:40.429 --> 04:10:40.439 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Comprehensive
 
04:10:43.870 --> 04:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
Health Care information system chis
 
04:10:45.510 --> 04:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
a version of which is publicly available
 
04:10:47.830 --> 04:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
to anybody and this includes procedure
 
04:10:50.710 --> 04:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
date times provider places of I think
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
most uh health insurance transactions
 
04:10:55.070 --> 04:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire health insurance
 
04:10:57.070 --> 04:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
providers there's also the adverse
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
reporting adverse event reporting form
 
04:11:01.309 --> 04:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
which also includes time and dates and
 
04:11:02.710 --> 04:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
04:11:04.590 --> 04:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
location um I also want to draw your
 
04:11:08.910 --> 04:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
attention to the 2022 study from the CDC
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
uh the abortion surveillance this is a
 
04:11:12.870 --> 04:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
national study that comes out every few
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
years and New Hampshire is called out 22
 
04:11:19.109 --> 04:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
times because we don't provide any
 
04:11:21.429 --> 04:11:21.439 align:start position:0%
data we're we're called out in the in
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the limitations right at the
 
04:11:22.920 --> 04:11:24.469 align:start position:0%
terms of the limitations right at the
beginning

04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
04:11:26.750 --> 04:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
So and I've heard a couple of times
 
04:11:28.149 --> 04:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
where people ask the question why do we
 
04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
need this well the CDC report has
 
04:11:31.710 --> 04:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
several reasons uh I'll just give you a
 
04:11:33.990 --> 04:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
couple evaluating programs aimed at
 
04:11:35.950 --> 04:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
promoting Equitable access to patient-
 
04:11:37.309 --> 04:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
centered contraceptive care in the
 
04:11:39.269 --> 04:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
United States to reduce unintended
 
04:11:41.670 --> 04:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
pregnancies assess changes in clinical
 
04:11:43.229 --> 04:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
practice patterns over time in
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
information in this report on the number
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
of abortions performed through different
 
04:11:47.870 --> 04:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
methods and at different gestational
 
04:11:49.790 --> 04:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
ages provides a denominator data that
 
04:11:51.830 --> 04:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
are necessary for analyses on the
 
04:11:54.429 --> 04:11:54.439 align:start position:0%
relative safety of abortion
 
04:11:56.429 --> 04:11:56.439 align:start position:0%
procedures now we've also heard some
 
04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
conversation about the cost and who
 
04:12:01.349 --> 04:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
should be doing this with DHHS or Vital
 
04:12:03.309 --> 04:12:03.319 align:start position:0%
Statistics um I'll just point out that
 
04:12:06.030 --> 04:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
as I was reviewing the uh the laws in
 
04:12:08.469 --> 04:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states main Vermont and
 
04:12:10.710 --> 04:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont calls it a fetal
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
death report and they include this
 
04:12:16.030 --> 04:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh I believe as part of their of their
 
04:12:18.670 --> 04:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
equivalent of our Vital
 
04:12:23.229 --> 04:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
Statistics so um also I've heard some
 
04:12:24.550 --> 04:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
04:12:26.670 --> 04:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
privacy uh one thing I'd call your
 
04:12:28.429 --> 04:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
attention to is that there is not one
 
04:12:30.870 --> 04:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
example of harm that's happened in any
 
04:12:34.710 --> 04:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
of the 46 States or DC over the decades
 
04:12:36.550 --> 04:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
that this data has been collected that
 
04:12:38.309 --> 04:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
can be tied back to start wrapping up
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
please okay thank you Mr chairman uh in
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
conclusion I I just want to also State
 
04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
we do request a couple of changes uh
 
04:12:46.750 --> 04:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
first one would be to keep the field
 
04:12:49.269 --> 04:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
Life protection in intact uh we have
 
04:12:50.750 --> 04:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
we've heard no testimony that this has
 
04:12:53.469 --> 04:12:53.479 align:start position:0%
caused this language has caused any harm
 
04:12:55.389 --> 04:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
uh we would include the reporting of
 
04:12:55.399 --> 04:12:56.750 align:start position:0%
uh we would include the reporting of
post-abortion

04:12:56.750 --> 04:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
post-abortion
 
04:12:58.830 --> 04:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
complications include a penalty so that
 
04:13:00.429 --> 04:13:00.439 align:start position:0%
it's enforceable for instance Vermont
 
04:13:04.189 --> 04:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
assesses a $500 uh VI ticket for
 
04:13:06.790 --> 04:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
violation uh give give some Ru making
 
04:13:08.790 --> 04:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
authority to whichever Department you
 
04:13:11.189 --> 04:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
decide and in terms of
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality uh has uh has a very
 
04:13:16.429 --> 04:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
short law it includes confidentiality
 
04:13:18.070 --> 04:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
requirements and with that I would be
 
04:13:19.630 --> 04:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you Mr
 
04:13:23.109 --> 04:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative Seth King
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
04:13:27.910 --> 04:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
testimony um sounds like there are 46
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
States um many of which are very
 
04:13:36.790 --> 04:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
favorable for um pro-abortion Advocates
 
04:13:41.790 --> 04:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
that take some sort of data um and I'm
 
04:13:44.830 --> 04:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
04:13:46.950 --> 04:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
when you look at the list here A through
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
f is are all of these things in all
 
04:13:53.870 --> 04:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
these other states or does this bit of
 
04:13:55.790 --> 04:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
legislation go above and beyond what is
 
04:13:58.269 --> 04:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
asked in these other states or I mean it
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're hoping that we'll at
 
04:14:01.189 --> 04:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
least catch up to where everybody else
 
04:14:03.550 --> 04:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
is because we're so far behind does this
 
04:14:05.950 --> 04:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
go too far is there any is there
 
04:14:07.469 --> 04:14:07.479 align:start position:0%
anything in this list that you would be
 
04:14:10.349 --> 04:14:10.359 align:start position:0%
find getting rid of to you know maybe
 
04:14:12.630 --> 04:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
catch up with where Vermont or Maine or
 
04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
Mass chusetts are for example would you
 
04:14:17.149 --> 04:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
be fine with getting rid of A and B and
 
04:14:19.830 --> 04:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
then keeping C through F uh what are
 
04:14:21.670 --> 04:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on this uh thank you
 
04:14:23.269 --> 04:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative I I unfortunately made
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
the Cardinal mistake of not bringing up
 
04:14:26.990 --> 04:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
a copy of the law U but what I will say
 
04:14:28.750 --> 04:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
is that as I reviewed the other states
 
04:14:30.750 --> 04:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
for instance I've got the main law right
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
in front of me it has date in place
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
abortion was performed the age of the
 
04:14:36.309 --> 04:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
person on whom the abortion was
 
04:14:38.670 --> 04:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
performed um I believe most of these
 
04:14:40.870 --> 04:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
concerns these data points that other
 
04:14:42.510 --> 04:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
people are concerned about have been
 
04:14:44.429 --> 04:14:44.439 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up these other states
 
04:14:48.389 --> 04:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
like Vermont and
 
04:14:50.670 --> 04:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts why do they even have this
 
04:14:52.830 --> 04:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
here I mean it sounds like generally
 
04:14:55.229 --> 04:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
speaking people that are pro abortion
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't like this information being there
 
04:14:59.349 --> 04:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
and yet in states that are very Pro
 
04:15:01.950 --> 04:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
abortion they have this information did
 
04:15:04.750 --> 04:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
this information get slipped in under a
 
04:15:07.710 --> 04:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
a very short Republican regime or what
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
happened why why is it that these states
 
04:15:12.309 --> 04:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
even have this information uh if if they
 
04:15:14.149 --> 04:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
generally don't like it thank you
 
04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative uh I cannot speak to the
 
04:15:18.349 --> 04:15:18.359 align:start position:0%
intent legislative intent for why they
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
have it but I can I can call your
 
04:15:23.070 --> 04:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
attention back to that 2022 uh CDC
 
04:15:24.750 --> 04:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
report where they outlined several
 
04:15:26.429 --> 04:15:26.439 align:start position:0%
reasons why they think at a national
 
04:15:28.990 --> 04:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
level uh this is very important for
 
04:15:32.429 --> 04:15:32.439 align:start position:0%
health outcomes thank you representative
 
04:15:34.429 --> 04:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so we heard
 
04:15:38.000 --> 04:15:38.950 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so we heard
prior

04:15:38.950 --> 04:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
prior
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that the data that is being
 
04:15:47.950 --> 04:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
asked for in this bill is just a
 
04:15:50.510 --> 04:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
completely incomplete data set and the
 
04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
fact the CDC is not going to be very
 
04:15:55.830 --> 04:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
useful to them so I'm trying to square
 
04:15:58.229 --> 04:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
your testimony saying this is data that
 
04:16:01.269 --> 04:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
the CDC wants versus other testimony
 
04:16:03.189 --> 04:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
that is saying this is a completely
 
04:16:05.830 --> 04:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
incomplete data set so I'm wondering if
 
04:16:08.269 --> 04:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
you kind of you know round out that
 
04:16:12.429 --> 04:16:12.439 align:start position:0%
Circle for me how did this data how was
 
04:16:14.710 --> 04:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
this select Ed um and how does it
 
04:16:16.269 --> 04:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
compare with these other states because
 
04:16:18.109 --> 04:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
it seems to me actually we would want to
 
04:16:20.990 --> 04:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
be taken away with adding and I'm just
 
04:16:22.830 --> 04:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to square the circle so
 
04:16:25.950 --> 04:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh so if you
 
04:16:27.790 --> 04:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
look at the CDC report there's actually
 
04:16:29.670 --> 04:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of data that they would like to
 
04:16:32.149 --> 04:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
collect that is not in here but as I
 
04:16:33.670 --> 04:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're called New Hampshire is
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
called out 22 times because of data we
 
04:16:38.149 --> 04:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
don't collect so it'll be something like
 
04:16:41.389 --> 04:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
oh here here's the uh abortions by uh
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
gestation limit and says New Hampshire
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't report this uh you know if we
 
04:16:48.189 --> 04:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
can get that down I mean more data is
 
04:16:50.389 --> 04:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
better than less data and other states
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
collect a heck of a lot more data than
 
04:16:55.149 --> 04:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
this um but this this is a very good
 
04:16:57.229 --> 04:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
start follow
 
04:17:00.269 --> 04:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
up uh thank you Mr shared thanks for
 
04:17:01.750 --> 04:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
taking the follow-up question which is
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
not really a follow-up but um
 
04:17:06.030 --> 04:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk talked a lot about
 
04:17:08.030 --> 04:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional Amendment we have
 
04:17:10.590 --> 04:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
which I totally supported and I continue
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
to support and so he was raising a lot
 
04:17:15.070 --> 04:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
of the privacy concerns that I share but
 
04:17:18.309 --> 04:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
he also went through a lot of fixes that
 
04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
he would put in place to kind of address
 
04:17:24.229 --> 04:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
those concerns um are you supportive of
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
those um or what are your thoughts on
 
04:17:29.429 --> 04:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative uh my
 
04:17:31.670 --> 04:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
opinion it would be that collecting
 
04:17:32.910 --> 04:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
something is better than collecting
 
04:17:35.590 --> 04:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
nothing and so if that's what if if if
 
04:17:36.550 --> 04:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
that's what the committee would be
 
04:17:38.269 --> 04:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
comfortable with uh we would be in
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
support of that representative
 
04:17:43.349 --> 04:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
and I concur with represent McLean New
 
04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has in its
 
04:17:50.950 --> 04:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
DNA privacy um so much so that we have
 
04:17:53.429 --> 04:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
it in our own state constitution and I
 
04:17:55.109 --> 04:17:55.119 align:start position:0%
really get nervous when we start having
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the state to collect data in any way
 
04:17:59.590 --> 04:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
that resembles personal data it could be
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
a even if you try to De identify it
 
04:18:04.910 --> 04:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
number two what question I have to you
 
04:18:07.429 --> 04:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
is that would you be okay with I think
 
04:18:10.750 --> 04:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
we do it many times is the opt out let
 
04:18:12.269 --> 04:18:12.279 align:start position:0%
the patient opt out of it if they don't
 
04:18:15.189 --> 04:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
want their information collected instead
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
of us mandating it that the patient
 
04:18:19.149 --> 04:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
always reserves that right to protect
 
04:18:21.269 --> 04:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
their privacy and therefore they can opt
 
04:18:24.630 --> 04:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
out of it thank thank you representative
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh one thing I'll call your attention to
 
04:18:29.309 --> 04:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
is that uh most studies that I've seen
 
04:18:30.990 --> 04:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
the way that they collect information is
 
04:18:33.109 --> 04:18:33.119 align:start position:0%
that they collect even personal
 
04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable data maybe at
 
04:18:36.630 --> 04:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
the state level or if it's a private
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
group doing it a private group but then
 
04:18:41.109 --> 04:18:41.119 align:start position:0%
they have strict rules on how they
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
release that data and so that and that's
 
04:18:45.429 --> 04:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
where the that's where the agency rul
 
04:18:46.750 --> 04:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
making comes into place because those
 
04:18:48.510 --> 04:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
rules change over time you know it used
 
04:18:50.229 --> 04:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
to be that you can include zip codes now
 
04:18:52.229 --> 04:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
you know we decide you don't because if
 
04:18:56.189 --> 04:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
there's too few people um go going back
 
04:19:00.750 --> 04:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
to your so sorry said the question I
 
04:19:03.910 --> 04:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
asked is what is your opinion of
 
04:19:06.189 --> 04:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
supporting the right for a patient to
 
04:19:08.429 --> 04:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
opt out of collecting any data that they
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't want collected because that's what
 
04:19:13.469 --> 04:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
a constitution allows for oh thank thank
 
04:19:14.790 --> 04:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
04:19:17.630 --> 04:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
question I so I have not read every
 
04:19:21.870 --> 04:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
State's uh abortion data collection law
 
04:19:23.550 --> 04:19:23.560 align:start position:0%
I but from the few that I have I have
 
04:19:26.189 --> 04:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
not seen anything about that I I'll also
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
say that um I really appreciated the
 
04:19:30.389 --> 04:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
Vermont way of doing it which is they
 
04:19:32.149 --> 04:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
consider it fetal death and Fetal death
 
04:19:34.990 --> 04:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
can be various reasons but the fact is
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
there's a there there is nobody can
 
04:19:39.109 --> 04:19:39.119 align:start position:0%
argue that there is a human being who
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
passed away and so therefore there
 
04:19:43.870 --> 04:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
should be some sort of record for it in
 
04:19:43.880 --> 04:19:45.510 align:start position:0%
should be some sort of record for it in
some

04:19:45.510 --> 04:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:19:47.670 --> 04:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
fashion other question representative
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%

04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
intention behind this bill um some
 
04:19:59.590 --> 04:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
people saying it's not clear what the
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
intention is other people talking about
 
04:20:06.429 --> 04:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
a public health um reason um and you you
 
04:20:09.149 --> 04:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
suggested something about not having
 
04:20:09.159 --> 04:20:10.830 align:start position:0%
suggested something about not having
information

04:20:10.830 --> 04:20:10.840 align:start position:0%

of the committee for the record my name

is Ava Hawks and I am the director of
 
04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
advocacy for the New Hampshire Medical
 
04:21:14.109 --> 04:21:14.119 align:start position:0%
Society uh as I noted on my pin card I
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
put three minutes but you've heard a
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
great deal of testimony majority of it
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
repeats my testimony so I'm just going
 
04:21:21.229 --> 04:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
to summarize and reinforce some points
 
04:21:22.910 --> 04:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
um for transparency and for clarity the
 
04:21:24.790 --> 04:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
medical society supported Senate Bill
 
04:21:27.670 --> 04:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
461 as introduced in the Senate we are
 
04:21:29.309 --> 04:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill as amended by the
 
04:21:32.109 --> 04:21:32.119 align:start position:0%
Senate um as you've already heard uh
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
thoroughly today in a postro world
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
providers of abortion care and patients
 
04:21:38.189 --> 04:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
alike are immediately alarmed when they
 
04:21:39.990 --> 04:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
see legislation that seeks to report
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive abortion care health
 
04:21:43.590 --> 04:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
information including a pregnant patient
 
04:21:45.109 --> 04:21:45.119 align:start position:0%
state of residence and the method used
 
04:21:47.269 --> 04:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
to perform an abortion information that
 
04:21:49.469 --> 04:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
we know has been weaponized in states
 
04:21:50.990 --> 04:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
that are currently hostile to abortion
 
04:21:52.269 --> 04:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
care and reproductive Health Care
 
04:21:54.469 --> 04:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
Providers um I will reiterate that when
 
04:21:55.710 --> 04:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
we present when presented the
 
04:21:58.750 --> 04:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity this legislative session uh
 
04:22:00.469 --> 04:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
the beautiful body across the street did
 
04:22:02.550 --> 04:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
reject measures to implement a shield
 
04:22:04.950 --> 04:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
law in our state and so to that point I
 
04:22:06.670 --> 04:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
I want to reiterate the points raised by
 
04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
previous testifiers that with that lack
 
04:22:10.469 --> 04:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
of a shield law protection in New
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we have additional concerns
 
04:22:15.550 --> 04:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
about codifying such reporting um in our
 
04:22:17.590 --> 04:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
state and I will note just last week
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
Main's Governor signed a bill into law
 
04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
to protect their State's providers of
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
abortion care from actions by other
 
04:22:24.910 --> 04:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
states so a shield law and other states
 
04:22:26.830 --> 04:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
in New England have done the same I know
 
04:22:29.389 --> 04:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
there's been um a number of data sets
 
04:22:31.389 --> 04:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
and reports referenced today and I know
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
there was mention of other states who
 
04:22:35.590 --> 04:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
already collect this data I I am not an
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
expert on when those laws were
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
implemented throughout the 46 States in
 
04:22:41.389 --> 04:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
DC but I would I would implore the
 
04:22:43.109 --> 04:22:43.119 align:start position:0%
committee to maybe look at what what
 
04:22:44.670 --> 04:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
times those laws were implemented and if
 
04:22:48.109 --> 04:22:48.119 align:start position:0%
they were before uh the Dos decision so
 
04:22:50.109 --> 04:22:50.119 align:start position:0%
I will leave it at that and I I'm happy
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
04:22:54.189 --> 04:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
04:22:57.469 --> 04:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you thank
 
04:22:59.950 --> 04:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to testify on
 
04:23:02.510 --> 04:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:02.520 --> 04:23:05.950 align:start position:0%
 
461

database just want to clarify for the
 
04:23:19.349 --> 04:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
committee that that database is
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
specifically prohibited from including
 
04:23:26.229 --> 04:23:26.239 align:start position:0%

04:24:02.149 --> 04:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record Cindy rosenal
 
04:24:04.990 --> 04:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
Senate District 13 I neglected to
 
04:24:08.070 --> 04:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
introduce myself on the previous bill
 
04:24:10.469 --> 04:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
but I have the honor to represent most
 
04:24:15.269 --> 04:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
of nashwa and I really pleased to
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill
 
04:24:21.510 --> 04:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
412 which will allow Cedar Crest an
 
04:24:25.309 --> 04:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
intermediate Care Facility serving
 
04:24:28.389 --> 04:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities and complex
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
medical needs in Keen to temporarily add
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
two more beds for two
 
04:24:38.670 --> 04:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
years as you may recall from last year's
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:24:43.990 --> 04:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
2 Cedar Crest came to us a year ago and
 
04:24:47.309 --> 04:24:47.319 align:start position:0%
said there was a New Hampshire child
 
04:24:50.590 --> 04:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
receiving care residing in a facility
 
04:24:53.670 --> 04:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
out of state whose family would like the
 
04:24:56.830 --> 04:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
child to come back to New Hampshire but
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
there was no better available at Cedar
 
04:25:03.990 --> 04:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
Crest which was the facility that was
 
04:25:08.670 --> 04:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
able to care for them so in House Bill 2
 
04:25:12.309 --> 04:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
we authorized one additional bed for one
 
04:25:16.670 --> 04:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
one year the reason that the state needs
 
04:25:19.910 --> 04:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
to authorize additional beds in the
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
first place is that we've had a
 
04:25:27.429 --> 04:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
moratorium on long-term care bed
 
04:25:31.389 --> 04:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
expansion in place since
 
04:25:34.990 --> 04:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
1995 we put the moratorium in place
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
right after we became the first state to
 
04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
close our Institution for children with
 
04:25:43.950 --> 04:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
develop mental
 
04:25:46.590 --> 04:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities that was done in response
 
04:25:46.600 --> 04:25:47.670 align:start position:0%
disabilities that was done in response
to

04:25:47.670 --> 04:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:25:50.950 --> 04:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
litigation since we closed the lonia
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
state school we have prided ourselves on
 
04:25:57.710 --> 04:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that we partner with families
 
04:26:00.990 --> 04:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
to provide the array of services that
 
04:26:04.109 --> 04:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
allow children with complex
 
04:26:06.910 --> 04:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities to live in
 
04:26:06.920 --> 04:26:07.950 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities to live in
their

04:26:07.950 --> 04:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:26:10.429 --> 04:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
communities the long-term care
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
moratorium is important for other
 
04:26:17.030 --> 04:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
reasons too we've had a decades long
 
04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
focus on rebalancing long-term care it's
 
04:26:26.149 --> 04:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
what most individuals and families
 
04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
want it's also less costly than a
 
04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
nursing home and since the majority of
 
04:26:37.389 --> 04:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
long-term care is paid for by Medicade
 
04:26:40.510 --> 04:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
cost is an important
 
04:26:42.750 --> 04:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
consideration and the long long-term
 
04:26:46.189 --> 04:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
care moratorium is also important
 
04:26:49.750 --> 04:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
because we have a Workforce shortage
 
04:26:53.870 --> 04:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
that's particularly acute in health care
 
04:26:57.469 --> 04:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
so I am fully supportive of allowing
 
04:27:01.349 --> 04:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
this temporary expansion to help Cedar
 
04:27:05.149 --> 04:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
Crest serve New Hampshire's children
 
04:27:08.670 --> 04:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
with complex needs and so I believe that
 
04:27:12.750 --> 04:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
two additional beds for two years is is
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate and I'm happy to answer
 
04:27:18.389 --> 04:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lon um thank
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you senator
 
04:27:22.670 --> 04:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
for bringing this to us um looking at
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
this the only question I really see is
 
04:27:27.389 --> 04:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
this doesn't take effect until June 30th
 
04:27:29.109 --> 04:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
um does do they need to have this
 
04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility sooner or is June 30 30th
 
04:27:34.429 --> 04:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
soon enough
 
04:27:38.910 --> 04:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
um well I think that that's a great
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
question I don't know at this point if
 
04:27:43.990 --> 04:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
we could get it
 
04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
enacted and signed into law before June
 
04:27:52.109 --> 04:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
30th but if you wanted to make it
 
04:27:56.710 --> 04:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
effective on passage the reason the
 
04:28:01.109 --> 04:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
reason it says June 30th is that the one
 
04:28:07.229 --> 04:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
extra bed expires on June 30th so if we
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
allowed two extra beds before that it
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
would actually be three extra beds for a
 
04:28:15.469 --> 04:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
month so that might
 
04:28:17.910 --> 04:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
be um
 
04:28:20.070 --> 04:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
disruptive oh thank you I think that's
 
04:28:23.309 --> 04:28:23.319 align:start position:0%
that's why I drafted it as June 30th
 
04:28:25.229 --> 04:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and then as a followup looking
 
04:28:27.269 --> 04:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
at that if somehow this ended up being
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
July 4 well it wouldn't be the fourth
 
04:28:31.109 --> 04:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
but a few days later we should at least
 
04:28:33.229 --> 04:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
have that intent that it's continuous so
 
04:28:36.109 --> 04:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
I like your language thank you thank you
 
04:28:38.109 --> 04:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
04:28:40.750 --> 04:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:28:42.590 --> 04:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and for
 
04:28:43.790 --> 04:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
bringing this
 
04:28:47.710 --> 04:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
legislation um I have visited Cedar
 
04:28:51.070 --> 04:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
Crest and my question
 
04:28:54.910 --> 04:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
is the care that they provide is very
 
04:28:57.070 --> 04:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
specialized and very comprehensive for
 
04:29:01.070 --> 04:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
children who are both um very medically
 
04:29:02.670 --> 04:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
needed and also
 
04:29:02.680 --> 04:29:04.349 align:start position:0%
needed and also
developmentally

04:29:04.349 --> 04:29:04.359 align:start position:0%
developmentally
 
04:29:07.510 --> 04:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
delayed and my question
 
04:29:11.510 --> 04:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
is why are we sunsetting the two
 
04:29:14.030 --> 04:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
additional beds in
 
04:29:17.109 --> 04:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
2026 do we know that specific children
 
04:29:20.630 --> 04:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
will have aged out of the necessity or
 
04:29:22.950 --> 04:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
aged out of eligibility for Cedar Crest
 
04:29:25.870 --> 04:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
at that point um
 
04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
or I I guess I'm wondering why we don't
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
just authorize the two additional beds
 
04:29:33.790 --> 04:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
and leave them there because although I
 
04:29:36.710 --> 04:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
don't have any idea of the statistics in
 
04:29:40.389 --> 04:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
this particular population I am aware
 
04:29:46.550 --> 04:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
that there are any number of types of
 
04:29:49.750 --> 04:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
conditions that children have that
 
04:29:52.590 --> 04:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
require us to send them out of state
 
04:29:55.109 --> 04:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the available beds
 
04:29:57.309 --> 04:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
to treat whatever it is that they need
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's mental health care whether
 
04:30:02.790 --> 04:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's um abuse neglect followup whatever
 
04:30:05.990 --> 04:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
it is H so my question is why are why
 
04:30:09.550 --> 04:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
are we limiting it with the sunset and
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
are two beds adequate
 
04:30:17.870 --> 04:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
well that is a long question sorry
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
for a future legislative session this
 
04:30:25.389 --> 04:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
bill was a
 
04:30:28.710 --> 04:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
negotiation um I guess I would say that
 
04:30:32.750 --> 04:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
Cedar Crest also in addition to having
 
04:30:37.149 --> 04:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
children with complex needs reside there
 
04:30:40.630 --> 04:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
maybe permanently until they age out
 
04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
also offer some
 
04:30:44.670 --> 04:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
respit but it
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
also um houses some children from other
 
04:30:52.830 --> 04:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
states my inclination is that we should
 
04:30:57.950 --> 04:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
serve New Hampshire's children first and
 
04:30:57.960 --> 04:30:59.710 align:start position:0%
serve New Hampshire's children first and
so

04:30:59.710 --> 04:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:03.269 --> 04:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
I settled on this is what I'm willing to
 
04:31:06.189 --> 04:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
do if you want something different
 
04:31:09.349 --> 04:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
please find a different sponsor and I
 
04:31:09.359 --> 04:31:10.510 align:start position:0%
please find a different sponsor and I
know

04:31:10.510 --> 04:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
they're you'll probably hear from them
 
04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
but this was what I was willing to do I
 
04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
am not willing to blow up the long-term
 
04:31:24.830 --> 04:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
care moratorium I was not planning on
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
getting into this today but you brought
 
04:31:33.710 --> 04:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:37.990 --> 04:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
start just picking and choosing or
 
04:31:41.309 --> 04:31:41.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise blowing up the long-term care
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
bed more
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
moratorium the next people asking for
 
04:31:48.790 --> 04:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
expansions will be the
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
counties and I think the state cost of
 
04:31:58.830 --> 04:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:01.790 --> 04:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
uncontrollable and so I'm a cautious
 
04:32:03.189 --> 04:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
person by
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
Nature you know I said on finance I
 
04:32:09.469 --> 04:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
worry a lot about the Medicaid budget
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
this was what I was willing to bring in
 
04:32:16.429 --> 04:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
thank you other go ahead I have
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions about that County statement
 
04:32:19.229 --> 04:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
but I realize they're completely
 
04:32:21.630 --> 04:32:21.640 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to this bill so we can have
 
04:32:24.389 --> 04:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
that conversation offline representative
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman sorry
 
04:32:30.790 --> 04:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
um I know you talked initially about
 
04:32:33.950 --> 04:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
kind of the sensitive um relationship
 
04:32:37.229 --> 04:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
between institutional care and home care
 
04:32:40.750 --> 04:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
or Community Care and um so this is kind
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
of a would you believe question would
 
04:32:45.149 --> 04:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
you believe that in my years serving on
 
04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee at at Cedar Crest
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
that they um do everything within their
 
04:32:56.269 --> 04:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
power in my view to promote family um
 
04:32:59.830 --> 04:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
involvement family um sensitivity to
 
04:33:03.189 --> 04:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
family needs and that they really go the
 
04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
distance in terms of bridging that gap
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
between institutional care and um making
 
04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
it personal and family centered I
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
certainly would believe that I guess I
 
04:33:17.830 --> 04:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
should also mention that as you know
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
Crotched Mountain closed a few years ago
 
04:33:25.269 --> 04:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
but it's been sold and um the new owner
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
is trying to reopen it that might be a
 
04:33:33.390 --> 04:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
place where some children with complex
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
medical needs also could reside so I
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
just I'm too cautious to blow up the
 
04:33:46.789 --> 04:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
long-term care
 
04:33:49.349 --> 04:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
moratorium representative kushman sorry
 
04:33:51.310 --> 04:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
about before that's okay thank you Mr
 
04:33:53.349 --> 04:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
question and you just um opened up to
 
04:33:59.150 --> 04:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
what I was going to ask about is
 
04:34:02.349 --> 04:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
Crotched Mountain because I re just last
 
04:34:05.310 --> 04:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
week got um a request for help from an
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
86-year-old grandmother who is Raising
 
04:34:10.029 --> 04:34:10.039 align:start position:0%
her medically complicated
 
04:34:12.269 --> 04:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
grandson and
 
04:34:14.789 --> 04:34:14.799 align:start position:0%
they he's in the day program at Crotched
 
04:34:16.910 --> 04:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
Mountain but they do have residential
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
over there and she's trying to get him
 
04:34:21.189 --> 04:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
in there so I did reach out to the
 
04:34:25.150 --> 04:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
department to see what we can do um so I
 
04:34:27.789 --> 04:34:27.799 align:start position:0%
I wasn't aware that it was my
 
04:34:28.750 --> 04:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
understanding from looking at their
 
04:34:30.269 --> 04:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
website that they do have their
 
04:34:33.070 --> 04:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
residential program Open um so that's
 
04:34:35.070 --> 04:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
why I was one my question was going to
 
04:34:39.230 --> 04:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
be this doesn't specify Cedar Crest um
 
04:34:42.590 --> 04:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
and so what might we end up with a uh
 
04:34:47.390 --> 04:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
competition over who gets the bed and um
 
04:34:49.949 --> 04:34:49.959 align:start position:0%
I just it seems that there needs to be
 
04:34:53.390 --> 04:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
some long-term solution for this issue I
 
04:34:54.629 --> 04:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
know you don't want to blow up the
 
04:34:56.830 --> 04:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
moratorium but maybe we need to start
 
04:35:01.551 --> 04:35:01.561 align:start position:0%
inching it um a little wider so we have
 
04:35:05.150 --> 04:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
more beds available maybe on a slow um
 
04:35:05.160 --> 04:35:06.310 align:start position:0%
more beds available maybe on a slow um
slowly

04:35:06.310 --> 04:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
slowly
 
04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
opening scale what are you what are your
 
04:35:11.910 --> 04:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
thoughts so um the reason it doesn't
 
04:35:14.670 --> 04:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
mention Cedar Crest is that they're the
 
04:35:14.680 --> 04:35:15.910 align:start position:0%
mention Cedar Crest is that they're the
only

04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:35:19.869 --> 04:35:19.879 align:start position:0%
Intermediate Care Facility in the state
 
04:35:19.879 --> 04:35:21.830 align:start position:0%
Intermediate Care Facility in the state
for

04:35:21.830 --> 04:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%
miners um Crotched
 
04:35:28.869 --> 04:35:28.879 align:start position:0%
Mountain was licensed as a
 
04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
hospital so um they're different I guess
 
04:35:38.029 --> 04:35:38.039 align:start position:0%
my reaction would be we should serve New
 
04:35:43.029 --> 04:35:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:45.150 --> 04:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
I agree thank
 
04:35:47.310 --> 04:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for Senator
 
04:35:47.320 --> 04:35:48.990 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for Senator

you also signed up to speak and I'm not
 
04:36:01.750 --> 04:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
sure if I'll pronounce the name

correctly Jay hastan I believe it is
 
04:36:06.789 --> 04:36:06.799 align:start position:0%
appropriately from

04:36:15.429 --> 04:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you committee I
 
04:36:17.109 --> 04:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
was anticipating questions in the time I
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:23.629 --> 04:36:23.639 align:start position:0%

and education to the state's most

medically and developmentally complex
 
04:36:41.670 --> 04:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
children our job each day is to handle
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
incredibly challenging medical
 
04:36:45.510 --> 04:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
Developmental and therapeutic needs so
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
that these kids can be kids uh so that
 
04:36:50.189 --> 04:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
they can play that they can learn and
 
04:36:52.590 --> 04:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
they can grow we're a private not
 
04:36:54.789 --> 04:36:54.799 align:start position:0%
for-profit licensed as the state's only

Intermediate Care
 
04:36:59.150 --> 04:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
Facility uh ranging in age today from
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
infants through age 22 we're the only
 
04:37:04.269 --> 04:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
facility of our type in the state to
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
give you an idea of that medical
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
complexity 40% of the children we serve
 
04:37:11.029 --> 04:37:11.039 align:start position:0%
right now use ventilators to assist with
 
04:37:12.629 --> 04:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
their breathing for all are part of the
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
day and 100% of the folks that that we
 
04:37:18.629 --> 04:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
serve currently have a g or a GJ tube by
 
04:37:20.029 --> 04:37:20.039 align:start position:0%
which they get the majority of their
 
04:37:21.310 --> 04:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
life- sustaining
 
04:37:23.349 --> 04:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
nutrition if you are familiar with other
 
04:37:24.830 --> 04:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in the state you know that
 
04:37:26.709 --> 04:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
it's very rare to find a single
 
04:37:29.349 --> 04:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
ventilator um in an entire Nursing Home
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
in our small facility we have 10 we also
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
provide special education instruction
 
04:37:35.470 --> 04:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
and an approved private school on our
 
04:37:37.310 --> 04:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
premises as well as a great deal of
 
04:37:39.189 --> 04:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
respit care to give families and
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
caregivers a much needed break
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
by way of context last year we had seven
 
04:37:46.949 --> 04:37:46.959 align:start position:0%
long-term Admissions and 62 different
 
04:37:46.959 --> 04:37:48.269 align:start position:0%
long-term Admissions and 62 different
respit

04:37:48.269 --> 04:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
respit
 
04:37:51.269 --> 04:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
stays uh we feel that our role is very
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
critical in the Continuum of Care
 
04:37:54.750 --> 04:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
because we're the only pediatric
 
04:37:57.189 --> 04:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
post-acute setting with this population
 
04:37:59.470 --> 04:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
specialty meaning we're the only place
 
04:38:01.629 --> 04:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
for someone to go who has this need
 
04:38:04.429 --> 04:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
profile to wean off of a ventilator uh
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
to to to get lung function strong enough
 
04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
to go home with parents if if that is
 
04:38:11.510 --> 04:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
the long-term goal we celebrate
 
04:38:14.709 --> 04:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
discharges it it is uh Bittersweet when
 
04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
someone you've known for a long time
 
04:38:19.310 --> 04:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
goes home but it is our our favorite our
 
04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
favorite thing to do uh when someone is
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
able to graduate from our setting to a
 
04:38:25.470 --> 04:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
less restrictive
 
04:38:28.150 --> 04:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
setting the average age at admission is
 
04:38:30.189 --> 04:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
seven and the average length of stay
 
04:38:31.629 --> 04:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
over a long period of time is
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
approximately 3 years that includes uh
 
04:38:36.109 --> 04:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
folks who were with us for a very short
 
04:38:38.189 --> 04:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
period of time as well as folks who are
 
04:38:40.470 --> 04:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
with us over a period of years because
 
04:38:42.670 --> 04:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
they may not have a home setting to go
 
04:38:45.990 --> 04:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
back to um consider children who are in
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
DCF custody that that sort of
 
04:38:52.109 --> 04:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
thing demand has increased for for our
 
04:38:54.310 --> 04:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
level of of services so over the past
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
handful of years we've seen a marked
 
04:38:58.949 --> 04:38:58.959 align:start position:0%
increase nearly a third uh in inquiries
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
for our level of care inquiries tend to
 
04:39:04.670 --> 04:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
take a long time to mature from initial
 
04:39:06.990 --> 04:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
Outreach to a referral to someone
 
04:39:09.230 --> 04:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
spending time with us so even though we
 
04:39:12.590 --> 04:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
have a high volume of inquiries you see
 
04:39:15.269 --> 04:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
last year 110 inquiries a little more
 
04:39:17.189 --> 04:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
than half of which would would be deemed
 
04:39:19.551 --> 04:39:19.561 align:start position:0%
appropriate for some of our one or more
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
of our
 
04:39:23.189 --> 04:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
services uh and seven long-term admits
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
and I think that speaks to the idea that
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
it is a long process to go from hospital
 
04:39:29.349 --> 04:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
to home including potentially a stay at
 
04:39:29.359 --> 04:39:31.990 align:start position:0%
to home including potentially a stay at
Cedar

04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:34.269 --> 04:39:34.279 align:start position:0%
Crest we're very grateful that our bed
 
04:39:36.070 --> 04:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
license was expanded by a single bed
 
04:39:40.030 --> 04:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
last year in House Bill 2 uh we maintain
 
04:39:41.788 --> 04:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
an active weight list of resp and long
 
04:39:44.310 --> 04:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
stay inquiries um over the next couple
 
04:39:47.350 --> 04:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
of months without uh the the current
 
04:39:50.708 --> 04:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
bill or uh the the existing bed
 
04:39:54.750 --> 04:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
extension we have 18 18 different respit
 
04:39:57.150 --> 04:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
requests uh that would put us over
 
04:39:59.150 --> 04:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
capacity and that's just over the next
 
04:40:01.510 --> 04:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
couple of months of of of
 
04:40:03.830 --> 04:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
Summer also want to mention that
 
04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
families and children are in need of
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
these services for which we're the only
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
setting Hospital partners and Care teams
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
want to discharge these kids to a postc
 
04:40:13.150 --> 04:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
environment it's important in that
 
04:40:15.788 --> 04:40:15.798 align:start position:0%
Continuum of Care this frees up critical
 
04:40:17.788 --> 04:40:17.798 align:start position:0%
beds and hospitals and saves taxpayers
 
04:40:19.628 --> 04:40:19.638 align:start position:0%
money as the cost of Care at Cedar Crest
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
is between two and five times less per
 
04:40:24.670 --> 04:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
bed day than what it would be in a
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
specialty hospital like
 
04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth uh as we are the only facility
 
04:40:31.750 --> 04:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
of our type families who cannot support
 
04:40:34.030 --> 04:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
Care at home turn to us for a break for
 
04:40:36.430 --> 04:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
a rehabilitative stay for day education
 
04:40:39.230 --> 04:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
in our school or sometimes for a longer
 
04:40:39.240 --> 04:40:40.230 align:start position:0%
in our school or sometimes for a longer
term

04:40:40.230 --> 04:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:40:42.628 --> 04:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
stay given the sensitivity surrounding
 
04:40:44.230 --> 04:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
the bed moratorium we worked with
 
04:40:46.390 --> 04:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald on on this proposal
 
04:40:50.350 --> 04:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
for for two additional beds uh this is a
 
04:40:52.030 --> 04:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
unique population and their needs are
 
04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
well met in our setting as the only
 
04:40:56.070 --> 04:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
setting for them in the Continuum of
 
04:40:57.990 --> 04:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
Care we thank you for hearing this bill
 
04:40:59.910 --> 04:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
and urge its passage as
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
introduced I'm very happy to take any
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you rep
 
04:41:06.670 --> 04:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
04:41:07.708 --> 04:41:07.718 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:41:09.670 --> 04:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
question um just a simple question I
 
04:41:11.830 --> 04:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
would hope what is the total capacity of
 
04:41:14.390 --> 04:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
C Chris right now sure so our base
 
04:41:16.190 --> 04:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
capacity is 26 we have long been
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
licensed at 26 uh beds in the home um 27
 
04:41:23.670 --> 04:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
given house bill to last year thank you
 
04:41:25.310 --> 04:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
04:41:27.270 --> 04:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
mlan yeah thank you and thank you for
 
04:41:30.270 --> 04:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um so if you have
 
04:41:32.230 --> 04:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
what is the average weight time then to
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
get into Cedar Crest and what happens
 
04:41:39.030 --> 04:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
how what happens with these people while
 
04:41:41.910 --> 04:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
they're waiting sure it's a great
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
question it depends on where uh where
 
04:41:47.030 --> 04:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
that referral is originating uh majority
 
04:41:49.390 --> 04:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
of our referrals come directly from from
 
04:41:51.390 --> 04:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
the hospital so it might be an infant
 
04:41:53.230 --> 04:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
who is PR presenting with these sorts of
 
04:41:55.628 --> 04:41:55.638 align:start position:0%
complex needs and perhaps the family
 
04:41:57.470 --> 04:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
need needs more time or or the child
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
needs that post-acute stay to get strong
 
04:42:02.190 --> 04:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
enough to go home those referrals uh
 
04:42:03.868 --> 04:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
tend to move more quickly because
 
04:42:06.510 --> 04:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
they're uh as as you're aware is a a lot
 
04:42:09.788 --> 04:42:09.798 align:start position:0%
of pressure to free up hospital beds
 
04:42:11.550 --> 04:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes the conversations play over a
 
04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
longer period of time if you think um I
 
04:42:16.990 --> 04:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
believe rep rep kushman mentioned an
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
aging caregiver when it's an aging
 
04:42:21.628 --> 04:42:21.638 align:start position:0%
caregiver situation ideally we're uh
 
04:42:24.350 --> 04:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
having conversations well in advance of
 
04:42:26.910 --> 04:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh of needing a stay and so we can work
 
04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
with the team to uh to assemble the
 
04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
supports to to to get folks to us we we
 
04:42:34.590 --> 04:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
have not had to delay many admissions
 
04:42:36.550 --> 04:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
over the past couple of years but part
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
of the conversation with the senator and
 
04:42:41.230 --> 04:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh with our team around this legislation
 
04:42:43.230 --> 04:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
was we're we're bumping up against it
 
04:42:45.270 --> 04:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
where you know particularly spring and
 
04:42:47.070 --> 04:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
summer where we're very busy with rest
 
04:42:49.750 --> 04:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
bit stay requests we we have had to get
 
04:42:52.990 --> 04:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
into that game of Tetris of we cannot
 
04:42:54.670 --> 04:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
accommodate the rest bit stay that you'd
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
like for this week but we could do it
 
04:42:58.708 --> 04:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
the following week you know so juggling
 
04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
the needs of of families who who desire
 
04:43:03.390 --> 04:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
a short-term stay against those longer
 
04:43:06.310 --> 04:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
term admissions uh has become a
 
04:43:07.990 --> 04:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
complicated exercise and we are
 
04:43:10.948 --> 04:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
concerned that we are we we are bumping
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
up against that need to to delay
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chair and just a
 
04:43:20.510 --> 04:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
quick followup so this bill is for two
 
04:43:23.470 --> 04:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
years so it's it's a temporary thing I'm
 
04:43:27.270 --> 04:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
assuming it's a bridge to something um
 
04:43:29.868 --> 04:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
so what happens at the end of this two
 
04:43:32.750 --> 04:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
years what's what's what's the next step
 
04:43:35.470 --> 04:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh where we're going with
 
04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
this sure great question so we we have
 
04:43:39.430 --> 04:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
sort of the narrow question of of two
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
beds and then there sort of more general
 
04:43:43.390 --> 04:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
question that the senator alluded to in
 
04:43:45.628 --> 04:43:45.638 align:start position:0%
in terms of the bed moratorium our
 
04:43:48.190 --> 04:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
physical plant capacity would not uh
 
04:43:50.550 --> 04:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
comfortably accommodate more than 28 uh
 
04:43:53.150 --> 04:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
long-term beds and so this uh positions
 
04:43:55.510 --> 04:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
us well for for for where we are
 
04:43:57.150 --> 04:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
currently we're in the midst of a
 
04:43:59.510 --> 04:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
long-term analysis of both population
 
04:44:01.830 --> 04:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
Health as well as our census Trends to
 
04:44:04.670 --> 04:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
try and project uh what the need may be
 
04:44:07.510 --> 04:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
over time we know that it has increased
 
04:44:10.030 --> 04:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
sharply in the post-pandemic uh time
 
04:44:12.270 --> 04:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
frame but we want to be very sure that
 
04:44:14.910 --> 04:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
that we know how much it might increase
 
04:44:17.390 --> 04:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
going forward so I think that this bill
 
04:44:20.310 --> 04:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
is uh uh well well timed and well
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
positioned for us because it allows us
 
04:44:24.550 --> 04:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
to utilize all available resources over
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
the next two years and to make the case
 
04:44:30.150 --> 04:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
um if there is a community need for the
 
04:44:30.160 --> 04:44:31.390 align:start position:0%
um if there is a community need for the
period

04:44:31.390 --> 04:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:44:33.430 --> 04:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
following other
 
04:44:35.948 --> 04:44:35.958 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:44:38.350 --> 04:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
Weber I was just interested in drilling
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
down a little more on the balance
 
04:44:40.400 --> 04:44:42.030 align:start position:0%
down a little more on the balance
between

04:44:42.030 --> 04:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh what I would call possibly
 
04:44:47.910 --> 04:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
inaccurately long-term care versus the
 
04:44:51.948 --> 04:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
respit care um do you have a sense and I
 
04:44:53.350 --> 04:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
understand your point about the game of
 
04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
Tetris you know you I already have
 
04:44:59.948 --> 04:44:59.958 align:start position:0%
people in this bed do you have kind of a
 
04:45:02.670 --> 04:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
an average balance between the two of
 
04:45:05.590 --> 04:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
those who are in in long-term residents
 
04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
versus those who are short-term yeah
 
04:45:10.350 --> 04:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
it's a it's it's a great question and
 
04:45:10.360 --> 04:45:11.750 align:start position:0%
it's a it's it's a great question and
definitionally

04:45:11.750 --> 04:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
definitionally
 
04:45:14.270 --> 04:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh any stay greater than 30 days is
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
considered a longterm stay for us and so
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
at any given time we may have a handful
 
04:45:21.470 --> 04:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
of folks that that earn a long-term stay
 
04:45:23.788 --> 04:45:23.798 align:start position:0%
but it has a clear a clear end point
 
04:45:26.590 --> 04:45:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's 60 days for rehabilitation
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
postoperatively or it's 30 days while a
 
04:45:32.430 --> 04:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
caregiver is is rehabilitating from a a
 
04:45:36.270 --> 04:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
procedure um or uh needs to travel uh
 
04:45:40.590 --> 04:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
currently we have 23 long-term stays so
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
folks who are in that uh 30 days or more
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
category and two short-term stays um I
 
04:45:48.230 --> 04:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
may have mentioned earlier over the next
 
04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
couple of months our short-term stay
 
04:45:53.110 --> 04:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
requests pick up uh pretty significantly
 
04:45:58.030 --> 04:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
we try to reserve a couple of um spots
 
04:46:01.150 --> 04:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
at all times for those rest bits stays
 
04:46:03.470 --> 04:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I hope that answers your
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative Murphy
 
04:46:08.110 --> 04:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
and then representative Merchant
 
04:46:11.310 --> 04:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
representative thank you once again um
 
04:46:14.550 --> 04:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
just a question with um um CIS
 
04:46:16.990 --> 04:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
particularly are you normally at 100%
 
04:46:20.470 --> 04:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
capacity and if so how do you staff that
 
04:46:23.628 --> 04:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
and with whom do you staff the um the
 
04:46:25.470 --> 04:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
the support that you need there yeah
 
04:46:27.990 --> 04:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for the question uh we
 
04:46:29.910 --> 04:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
over the past three years that I've been
 
04:46:32.190 --> 04:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
affiliated with the organization we have
 
04:46:36.350 --> 04:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
been close uh to to fully uh fully
 
04:46:39.070 --> 04:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
occupied uh we have been fully occupied
 
04:46:41.390 --> 04:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
on a handful of different occasions
 
04:46:43.070 --> 04:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
um so I mentioned right right now today
 
04:46:46.270 --> 04:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
we're at 25 uh we have multiple requests
 
04:46:47.750 --> 04:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
over the next couple of weeks that would
 
04:46:50.708 --> 04:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
put us above capacity I think our
 
04:46:50.718 --> 04:46:52.150 align:start position:0%
put us above capacity I think our
average

04:46:52.150 --> 04:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
average
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
utilization um over the time that I've
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
been with the organization is somewhere
 
04:46:55.760 --> 04:46:56.830 align:start position:0%
been with the organization is somewhere
around

04:46:56.830 --> 04:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:47:01.110 --> 04:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
24 uh perhaps 24 and a half but uh so we
 
04:47:04.110 --> 04:47:04.120 align:start position:0%
we have buted up against it um to you
 
04:47:06.948 --> 04:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
know to belabor that Tetris analogy it
 
04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
it it does uh uh stack awkwardly
 
04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes where you have three folks who
 
04:47:14.548 --> 04:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
need a short-term stay as you have 23
 
04:47:16.150 --> 04:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
long-term admits and now we're up
 
04:47:18.430 --> 04:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
against it for a period of weeks in
 
04:47:20.910 --> 04:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
terms of Staffing we we are we are very
 
04:47:25.070 --> 04:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
very lucky um in that uh employees are
 
04:47:27.948 --> 04:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
strongly attracted to our mission uh and
 
04:47:30.310 --> 04:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
have been uh with us for a long period
 
04:47:35.310 --> 04:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
of time and tend to come to us uh we we
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
have experienced challenges with
 
04:47:39.070 --> 04:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
Staffing as uh as all skilled settings
 
04:47:41.708 --> 04:47:41.718 align:start position:0%
have uh of of late but relatively
 
04:47:44.670 --> 04:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
speaking we we have weathered it um we
 
04:47:48.350 --> 04:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
we have weathered it we have uh
 
04:47:50.350 --> 04:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
proportionally fewer openings than than
 
04:47:52.548 --> 04:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
other skilled other skilled settings do
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
right now um I sit on the board of the
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Association uh for for New
 
04:47:58.030 --> 04:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and when I talk with my
 
04:48:01.470 --> 04:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues in long-term care uh they you
 
04:48:01.480 --> 04:48:02.708 align:start position:0%
colleagues in long-term care uh they you
know

04:48:02.708 --> 04:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:48:05.708 --> 04:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
they're 10 and 20% higher Staffing
 
04:48:07.470 --> 04:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
vacancies than than what we experience
 
04:48:09.628 --> 04:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
at cedarest so while we can always use
 
04:48:12.548 --> 04:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
more staff staff is not uh not where it
 
04:48:14.990 --> 04:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
was previously we have been relatively
 
04:48:18.548 --> 04:48:18.558 align:start position:0%
lucky follow thank you Mr chairman U
 
04:48:21.628 --> 04:48:21.638 align:start position:0%
Staffing that many beds is really
 
04:48:24.310 --> 04:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
remarkable um in hospitals that becomes
 
04:48:27.030 --> 04:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh do you have uh but more
 
04:48:29.470 --> 04:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
specifically do you are in that group of
 
04:48:31.868 --> 04:48:31.878 align:start position:0%
people that are Staffing the the
 
04:48:33.628 --> 04:48:33.638 align:start position:0%
facility are there Travelers involved
 
04:48:36.310 --> 04:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
with this or these are all local people
 
04:48:38.590 --> 04:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
yeah great question so we right now
 
04:48:41.310 --> 04:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
today I have two two Travelers
 
04:48:43.548 --> 04:48:43.558 align:start position:0%
in the building on on Time limited
 
04:48:45.548 --> 04:48:45.558 align:start position:0%
contracts uh We've made it a point of
 
04:48:47.548 --> 04:48:47.558 align:start position:0%
Pride to to limit the use of Travelers
 
04:48:49.070 --> 04:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
given the medical complexity of the
 
04:48:50.830 --> 04:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
population you know there's a learning
 
04:48:53.830 --> 04:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
curve anytime you uh you use Travelers
 
04:48:57.190 --> 04:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
but doubly so uh in in our population um
 
04:49:00.350 --> 04:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
so we have 90 regularly conditioned
 
04:49:03.230 --> 04:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
staff another 50 or so per Dum staff and
 
04:49:05.590 --> 04:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
and we've been really lucky to to have a
 
04:49:07.990 --> 04:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
very engaged prum staff pool and and to
 
04:49:10.470 --> 04:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
be able to for much of last year we did
 
04:49:13.470 --> 04:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
not use any Travelers uh we have a brief
 
04:49:15.708 --> 04:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
overlap where we have two in in house
 
04:49:17.548 --> 04:49:17.558 align:start position:0%
right now one will conclude their term
 
04:49:18.548 --> 04:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
in a couple
 
04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
weeks representative

does anyone else wish to testify on
 
04:49:59.788 --> 04:49:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:03.310 --> 04:50:03.320 align:start position:0%

track at least a little bit this bill is
 
04:50:51.628 --> 04:50:51.638 align:start position:0%
pretty simple our hearings are very
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
unpredictable my name is James Gray I am
 
04:50:58.230 --> 04:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
Senator representing Senate District 6
 
04:51:01.430 --> 04:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
which starts up in Alton and gton comes
 
04:51:03.910 --> 04:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
down Route 11 to
 
04:51:06.430 --> 04:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
Rochester right now we have uh two
 
04:51:08.310 --> 04:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
departments Health and Human Services in
 
04:51:10.990 --> 04:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
the office of uh Prof professional
 
04:51:13.868 --> 04:51:13.878 align:start position:0%
lenser which goes out and checks records
 
04:51:17.510 --> 04:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
for we don't need them both to do that
 
04:51:18.670 --> 04:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
uh for these
 
04:51:21.548 --> 04:51:21.558 align:start position:0%
certifications uh one is good enough and
 
04:51:23.910 --> 04:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
if you pass the Bill uh that's what'll
 
04:51:25.548 --> 04:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
happen they'll be able to cooperate with
 
04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
each other and share the data and the
 
04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
department is here to answer any
 
04:51:33.548 --> 04:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
questions that I
 
04:51:35.910 --> 04:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
can't think that's it any questions for
 
04:51:35.920 --> 04:51:38.110 align:start position:0%
can't think that's it any questions for
Senator

04:51:38.110 --> 04:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
04:51:41.310 --> 04:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
gray representative n Ram
 
04:51:43.830 --> 04:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
you said um thank you sorry and thank
 
04:51:45.230 --> 04:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
certifications or a
 
04:51:50.510 --> 04:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
lure well it all has to do with checking
 
04:51:53.310 --> 04:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
their certifications to provide their
 
04:51:55.628 --> 04:51:55.638 align:start position:0%
licenses okay thank
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for Senator gray
 
04:52:00.750 --> 04:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
04:52:02.750 --> 04:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
chairman just a quick question so you're
 
04:52:04.110 --> 04:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
saying that you're going to go from two
 
04:52:06.910 --> 04:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
to one and that no difference in the in
 
04:52:09.750 --> 04:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
the data shared would be different then
 
04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's basically share data right now
 
04:52:13.590 --> 04:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay and that's why what you see in the
 
04:52:15.948 --> 04:52:15.958 align:start position:0%
bill in both the upper section and the
 
04:52:19.750 --> 04:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
lower section and that's on line four
 
04:52:22.750 --> 04:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
and on line 11 they both say
 
04:52:25.990 --> 04:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding of the laws okay and
 
04:52:28.670 --> 04:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's to get around the Privacy stuff
 
04:52:31.948 --> 04:52:31.958 align:start position:0%
that we have uh built into other systems
 
04:52:34.830 --> 04:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
so that you can't have one Department
 
04:52:36.670 --> 04:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
share data with another department
 
04:52:39.190 --> 04:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
unless you have legislation that allows
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
it to happen this is the legislation
 
04:52:45.310 --> 04:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
that allows it to happen Qui follow so
 
04:52:47.070 --> 04:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
for myself to be clear then what you're
 
04:52:49.548 --> 04:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
saying is that you by virtue of this
 
04:52:52.230 --> 04:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
bill are eliminating a position having
 
04:52:54.430 --> 04:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
one position and therefore the data
 
04:52:56.470 --> 04:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's shared is probably not
 
04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
eliminating any position but we're
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
making it take less time for the process
 
04:53:04.310 --> 04:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
to happen again the department will be
 
04:53:08.270 --> 04:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
able to talk to this I mean you know
 
04:53:10.150 --> 04:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
they can tell you how many people that
 
04:53:11.948 --> 04:53:11.958 align:start position:0%
they're are licensed you know between
 
04:53:12.868 --> 04:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
them and
 
04:53:16.670 --> 04:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
oplc um I don't see that this doing that
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
but um you know when you go in for your
 
04:53:22.628 --> 04:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
recertification how many times do they
 
04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
need to check to make sure your license
 
04:53:27.110 --> 04:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
is current and you know everything is
 
04:53:29.590 --> 04:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
good we only need to do it once we just
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
need to be able to tell each other that
 
04:53:35.868 --> 04:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
it's good perect thank you other
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%

I I I would greatly appreciate if you
 
04:53:46.868 --> 04:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
could sort of concretize so thinking as
 
04:53:50.350 --> 04:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
an example Medicaid providers are for
 
04:53:52.830 --> 04:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
example a hospital or the individual
 
04:53:54.548 --> 04:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
Physicians the department will be able
 
04:53:57.548 --> 04:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
to answer that much better than I okay
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay well then we'll wait thank you

04:54:19.788 --> 04:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
name is Franchesca Hennessy I am from
 
04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
04:54:22.948 --> 04:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
Services I'm the administrator of fraud
 
04:54:25.390 --> 04:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
waste and abuse so one of the units that
 
04:54:29.190 --> 04:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
falls under um me is provider enrollment
 
04:54:31.788 --> 04:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
and I'm really anxious to answer all of
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
your questions I was just really ready
 
04:54:36.470 --> 04:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
to get at it in the audience there so I
 
04:54:39.150 --> 04:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
think um what I do want to emphasize
 
04:54:42.270 --> 04:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
earlier someone um was asking about who
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
has authority to have this data oplc has
 
04:54:47.948 --> 04:54:47.958 align:start position:0%
authority to have this data and DHHS has
 
04:54:49.868 --> 04:54:49.878 align:start position:0%
authority to have this data so we each
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
have the data all this would be doing is
 
04:54:54.510 --> 04:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
matching it in the data
 
04:54:57.750 --> 04:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
universe so
 
04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
um providers medical providers and and
 
04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
you had asked representative who are
 
04:55:04.430 --> 04:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid providers that's hospitals
 
04:55:06.868 --> 04:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
that's doctors Physicians Mental Health
 
04:55:09.868 --> 04:55:09.878 align:start position:0%
Providers we have over 30,000 Medicaid
 
04:55:11.390 --> 04:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
providers so it's all of them and
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
they're all licensed and Federal Law
 
04:55:17.070 --> 04:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
requires us to have licensed providers
 
04:55:18.628 --> 04:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
we can't have people who have dings on
 
04:55:20.910 --> 04:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
their licenses and what happens is a
 
04:55:23.910 --> 04:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
provider will enroll with Medicaid um
 
04:55:25.590 --> 04:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
and then after five years they will
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
recertify their enrollment but in the
 
04:55:32.070 --> 04:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
interim um for example I'm a lawyer and
 
04:55:35.310 --> 04:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
I get re-ed every year so I in the
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
interim providers May expire and have to
 
04:55:40.628 --> 04:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
show that they are relicensed
 
04:55:42.750 --> 04:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
again and so those are the that is the
 
04:55:44.590 --> 04:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
data Manch we would be constantly
 
04:55:48.030 --> 04:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
sharing again in the data Universe these
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
licenses so oplc can show us so and so
 
04:55:53.548 --> 04:55:53.558 align:start position:0%
is properly licensed and their license
 
04:55:56.788 --> 04:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
is up to date and then we can also um
 
04:55:58.548 --> 04:55:58.558 align:start position:0%
certify that to the federal government
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
say we are only paying Medicaid
 
04:56:03.070 --> 04:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
providers who are properly licensed and
 
04:56:05.350 --> 04:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
again those that
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
information is already possessed by the
 
04:56:09.948 --> 04:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
department the provider willingly signed
 
04:56:11.788 --> 04:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
up with with us and disclosed all this
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
information all we're doing is saying is
 
04:56:16.750 --> 04:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
that information on your license or up
 
04:56:16.760 --> 04:56:18.590 align:start position:0%
that information on your license or up
to

04:56:18.590 --> 04:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:56:21.628 --> 04:56:21.638 align:start position:0%
date that's it okay thank you any
 
04:56:22.990 --> 04:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
questions from Mrs
 
04:56:25.390 --> 04:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
Hennessy yes representative Murphy thank
 
04:56:26.788 --> 04:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
04:56:29.750 --> 04:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
the question my question is if I as a
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
provider where would I go then who do I
 
04:56:35.470 --> 04:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
go to to get certified um every other
 
04:56:37.110 --> 04:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
year whenever that might be and how
 
04:56:39.390 --> 04:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
would that mechanism work so your
 
04:56:41.270 --> 04:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
license a providers licensed or
 
04:56:43.510 --> 04:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
certified whatever the administrative
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
rules require of you um for example
 
04:56:48.830 --> 04:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
you're a physician and you get licensed
 
04:56:51.310 --> 04:56:51.320 align:start position:0%
every couple of years you go to oplc
 
04:56:53.548 --> 04:56:53.558 align:start position:0%
they will they do their licensure there
 
04:56:56.070 --> 04:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
and for for Medicaid purposes you come
 
04:56:59.230 --> 04:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
and enroll with Medicaid and you show us
 
04:57:02.430 --> 04:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
I'm properly licensed with
 
04:57:04.990 --> 04:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
oplc so bottom line is that it will not
 
04:57:08.350 --> 04:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
change for the provider oh no and if I
 
04:57:10.708 --> 04:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
may go so far as to say this may make
 
04:57:12.270 --> 04:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
providers happier because they don't
 
04:57:14.830 --> 04:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
have to constantly be doing this work
 
04:57:16.868 --> 04:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
themselves they can focus on their
 
04:57:19.708 --> 04:57:19.718 align:start position:0%
patience and not proving to DHHS that
 
04:57:22.830 --> 04:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
they're still properly
 
04:57:26.390 --> 04:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:28.788 --> 04:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank what
 
04:57:31.230 --> 04:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
represented Weber sorry I'm just trying
 
04:57:34.670 --> 04:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
to figure out how you're doing it now if
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
DHHS is not allowed to communicate with
 
04:57:43.310 --> 04:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
oplc how do you very ver ify now we or
 
04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
our contractor conduent will go to the
 
04:57:48.548 --> 04:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
oplc website and com through their
 
04:57:53.628 --> 04:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
records so we take that um there are
 
04:57:55.868 --> 04:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
times that it is missed and their
 
04:57:57.788 --> 04:57:57.798 align:start position:0%
records are just out there and on
 
04:57:59.830 --> 04:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
revalidation again that happens every
 
04:58:02.590 --> 04:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
five years with the provider we may say
 
04:58:05.310 --> 04:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
uhoh you need we need a current lure now
 
04:58:06.990 --> 04:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
but really under federal law we should
 
04:58:09.548 --> 04:58:09.558 align:start position:0%
have had that current lure documented
 
04:58:11.670 --> 04:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
for the the past few years when we did
 
04:58:16.270 --> 04:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
it so it protects us for documentation
 
04:58:18.270 --> 04:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
purposes for the federal government it
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
also would save us a tremendous amount
 
04:58:23.110 --> 04:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
of time okay or contct really yeah thank
 
04:58:26.788 --> 04:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:29.390 --> 04:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
questions I think I'm safe this time
 
04:58:34.470 --> 04:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:37.110 --> 04:58:37.120 align:start position:0%

the two duplicate entries it would be 15
 
04:59:03.270 --> 04:59:03.280 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair good afternoon

members of the committee for the record
 
04:59:28.070 --> 04:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
my name is Becky Whitley and I'm honored
 
04:59:30.070 --> 04:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
to represent New Hampshire Senate
 
04:59:32.470 --> 04:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
District 15 which you all sit in it
 
04:59:34.110 --> 04:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
includes the wonderful communities of
 
04:59:36.430 --> 04:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
conquered bow and hackington today I'm
 
04:59:39.110 --> 04:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
honored to introduce Senate Bill 411
 
04:59:42.030 --> 04:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
which takes just a minor step forward in
 
04:59:44.430 --> 04:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
addressing New Hampshire's Children's
 
04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis despite significant
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
public investment from the legislature
 
04:59:51.948 --> 04:59:51.958 align:start position:0%
to ensure that children have access to
 
04:59:54.150 --> 04:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
timely mental health treatment it
 
04:59:56.030 --> 04:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
remains important to ensure that all
 
04:59:57.590 --> 04:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
children including those with private
 
05:00:00.030 --> 05:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
insurance have access to the care that
 
05:00:02.990 --> 05:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
they so desperately need you may all
 
05:00:06.350 --> 05:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
know that we saw significant increases
 
05:00:08.430 --> 05:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
in children's mental health challenges
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic and we have not
 
05:00:12.350 --> 05:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
seen that
 
05:00:15.350 --> 05:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
dissipate in mid December right before I
 
05:00:17.948 --> 05:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill into the Senate 18
 
05:00:19.948 --> 05:00:19.958 align:start position:0%
children were boarded in emergency
 
05:00:23.150 --> 05:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
departments in acute psychiatric crisis
 
05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
waiting for care even one child awaiting
 
05:00:29.070 --> 05:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
services in an ER shows that there is
 
05:00:32.430 --> 05:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
way more that we can be doing 18 is
 
05:00:32.440 --> 05:00:33.708 align:start position:0%
way more that we can be doing 18 is
simply

05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
simply
 
05:00:36.070 --> 05:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
unacceptable the system we have set up
 
05:00:38.868 --> 05:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
to support Medicaid eligible children is
 
05:00:41.430 --> 05:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
quite robust yet now we're seeing an
 
05:00:43.110 --> 05:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
increasing amount of children with
 
05:00:45.470 --> 05:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
private insurance in the Medicaid
 
05:00:48.310 --> 05:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
system for a whole host of reasons and
 
05:00:50.430 --> 05:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
this bill as originally introduced was
 
05:00:52.350 --> 05:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
to address those gaps and hopefully
 
05:00:54.670 --> 05:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
reduce the financial pressure on the
 
05:00:57.868 --> 05:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system just to illustrate the
 
05:00:59.430 --> 05:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
pressure we're seeing on the Medicaid
 
05:01:01.830 --> 05:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
system it's worth noting that intake and
 
05:01:04.270 --> 05:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
determination data from The Fast Forward
 
05:01:06.670 --> 05:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
program that's the Medicaid Program for
 
05:01:08.510 --> 05:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
children with significant mental health
 
05:01:11.230 --> 05:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
needs so intake take between January
 
05:01:15.910 --> 05:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
2020 and October 2023 showed that 20% of
 
05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
those children referred to fast forward
 
05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
were privately insured of those 20%
 
05:01:21.680 --> 05:01:23.830 align:start position:0%
were privately insured of those 20%
another

05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:01:27.310 --> 05:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
80% ultimately found eligible for hipi
 
05:01:29.430 --> 05:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid what we used to call Katie
 
05:01:34.110 --> 05:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:36.590 --> 05:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
needs so I will say that you know
 
05:01:39.030 --> 05:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
children who are being pushed into the
 
05:01:40.590 --> 05:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system there are a whole host
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
of reasons there's not just one reason
 
05:01:44.470 --> 05:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
but it's something that we need to
 
05:01:46.910 --> 05:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
really look at and really address the
 
05:01:49.750 --> 05:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
total expense to the state for covering
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
Services render rendered to otherwise
 
05:01:54.510 --> 05:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
privately insured children exceeded $2
 
05:01:57.190 --> 05:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
million in the last banum that's both in
 
05:01:59.150 --> 05:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
fast forward and within our community
 
05:02:00.910 --> 05:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
mental health centers that are serving
 
05:02:02.948 --> 05:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
children so this is just screaming out
 
05:02:05.708 --> 05:02:05.718 align:start position:0%
for a policy solution the bill as
 
05:02:08.590 --> 05:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
introduced um is was very similar
 
05:02:10.030 --> 05:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
actually to a bill that was introduced
 
05:02:12.030 --> 05:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
in the Senate three years ago by Senator
 
05:02:14.510 --> 05:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
Tom Sherman making sure that there was
 
05:02:16.788 --> 05:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
just essentially parity between what's
 
05:02:18.350 --> 05:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
covered in the Medicaid system and what
 
05:02:21.310 --> 05:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
private insurance carriers are covering
 
05:02:23.270 --> 05:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
so that resulted in a whole host of
 
05:02:26.430 --> 05:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
conversations between all the parties um
 
05:02:27.868 --> 05:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
but it didn't resolve the issue so
 
05:02:29.670 --> 05:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
that's why we refiled the bill this year
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
and again folks have come back to the
 
05:02:33.868 --> 05:02:33.878 align:start position:0%
table and I just want to thank everyone
 
05:02:36.230 --> 05:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
who's come back to the table to address
 
05:02:39.150 --> 05:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
this issue and they really have um the
 
05:02:41.070 --> 05:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
vast majority of carriers have been at
 
05:02:43.070 --> 05:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
the table the Department of Insurance
 
05:02:45.868 --> 05:02:45.878 align:start position:0%
the providers they have spent hours
 
05:02:47.510 --> 05:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
working on this issue but we are not
 
05:02:49.548 --> 05:02:49.558 align:start position:0%
quite there yet the Department of
 
05:02:51.070 --> 05:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
Insurance who I believe is here today
 
05:02:53.430 --> 05:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
also issued a bulletin based on their
 
05:02:56.430 --> 05:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
initial work with all the parties but we
 
05:02:58.948 --> 05:02:58.958 align:start position:0%
but many folks in the Senate felt that
 
05:03:01.150 --> 05:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
it was important to retain legislative
 
05:03:03.390 --> 05:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
oversight we don't want to have to come
 
05:03:05.750 --> 05:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
back and two more years to file a bill
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
so that's why you will see the version
 
05:03:10.150 --> 05:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
before you was amended to create study
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
committee to retain that legislative
 
05:03:14.548 --> 05:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
oversight over this problem that we know
 
05:03:17.628 --> 05:03:17.638 align:start position:0%
is occurring and again very thankful for
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Insurance to the
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
carriers to the providers but this
 
05:03:22.990 --> 05:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
provides the necessary legislative
 
05:03:24.868 --> 05:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
oversight to keep everyone at the table
 
05:03:27.470 --> 05:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
and keep things moving I'm happy to take
 
05:03:29.788 --> 05:03:29.798 align:start position:0%
any questions I will surely defer more
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
technical questions to the folks behind
 
05:03:35.350 --> 05:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
me but I ask uh for your committee for
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
the committee support of s
 
05:03:40.030 --> 05:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
sp411 thank you representative Shapiro
 
05:03:41.510 --> 05:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:03:43.708 --> 05:03:43.718 align:start position:0%
taking this question so when I first
 
05:03:47.390 --> 05:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
read the um title of this bill I was
 
05:03:51.390 --> 05:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
wondering why this exists since I was
 
05:03:53.830 --> 05:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
just appointed to a commission on
 
05:03:56.390 --> 05:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health crisis Services um
 
05:03:58.110 --> 05:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
shared by Senator Apprentice so it
 
05:03:59.590 --> 05:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
seemed like the same thing but when I
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
read the bill um in fact this bill says
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
emergency mental health and this
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
commission is on Behavioral Health
 
05:04:10.270 --> 05:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
crisis services
 
05:04:16.750 --> 05:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:19.750 --> 05:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
um a misnomer in some sense since this
 
05:04:24.190 --> 05:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
is really this is this bill is really
 
05:04:24.200 --> 05:04:26.948 align:start position:0%
is really this is this bill is really
addressing

05:04:26.948 --> 05:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
um it might be it might be short-term
 
05:04:31.750 --> 05:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
but it might also be long-term mental
 
05:04:34.030 --> 05:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
health needs among children and mainly
 
05:04:36.590 --> 05:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
focused on like what resources available
 
05:04:39.430 --> 05:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
through what insurance sources yeah so
 
05:04:41.230 --> 05:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
if few things I think the term emergency
 
05:04:43.270 --> 05:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
was held over from a prior version of
 
05:04:45.948 --> 05:04:45.958 align:start position:0%
the bill I think this this committee is
 
05:04:47.310 --> 05:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
different because we're specifically
 
05:04:48.670 --> 05:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
looking at children and we're
 
05:04:50.030 --> 05:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
specifically looking at private
 
05:04:51.948 --> 05:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage so it is a little
 
05:04:53.390 --> 05:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
different than the other committee and
 
05:04:54.750 --> 05:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
you know there are different
 
05:04:57.230 --> 05:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
requirements in the children's system or
 
05:04:59.390 --> 05:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
different needs for children so it was
 
05:05:01.350 --> 05:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
necessary to have this committee look at
 
05:05:04.470 --> 05:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
this discret issue um the other piece is
 
05:05:06.750 --> 05:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
you know the goal of the whole bill was
 
05:05:08.470 --> 05:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that children with private
 
05:05:10.990 --> 05:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
insurance had access to the same types
 
05:05:12.590 --> 05:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
of services that children in the
 
05:05:14.670 --> 05:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system have we're just at a
 
05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
place where this legislature has in a
 
05:05:18.430 --> 05:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way really built up the
 
05:05:22.548 --> 05:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system to start uh working
 
05:05:24.910 --> 05:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
through the problem of kids being stuck
 
05:05:27.030 --> 05:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
in ER boarding room we are not there yet
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
I mean we are still in the in our ncy in
 
05:05:31.390 --> 05:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
building that system but eventually
 
05:05:32.948 --> 05:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
we're going to see you know those
 
05:05:34.510 --> 05:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
residential treatments come down those
 
05:05:36.390 --> 05:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
acute psychiatric hospitalizations come
 
05:05:38.390 --> 05:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
down as more kids have access to these
 
05:05:40.350 --> 05:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
services and we're just making Mak sure
 
05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
that all children have coverage
 
05:05:43.150 --> 05:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of their where their
 
05:05:45.750 --> 05:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
insurance comes from follow up follow up
 
05:05:48.310 --> 05:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
so I know from my time quite a while ago
 
05:05:51.070 --> 05:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
working in a mental health center um it
 
05:05:53.670 --> 05:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
was very there's a great irony in the
 
05:05:57.150 --> 05:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
fact that more middle class families
 
05:06:00.590 --> 05:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
with private insurance um those private
 
05:06:02.868 --> 05:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
insurances didn't fund the same kind of
 
05:06:05.190 --> 05:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
services that children with Medicaid had
 
05:06:07.070 --> 05:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
like home visitors and people to take
 
05:06:08.830 --> 05:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
them out into family workers to take
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
them out into the Community to um give
 
05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
them socialization case managers so um I
 
05:06:18.590 --> 05:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
know this has been an issue for a long
 
05:06:21.948 --> 05:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
time and so that's really that's really
 
05:06:24.590 --> 05:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that this um
 
05:06:27.510 --> 05:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
attempts to address yeah yes absolutely
 
05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
in particular what you mentioned
 
05:06:31.670 --> 05:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
functional Support Services these are a
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
lot of the services that our community
 
05:06:35.070 --> 05:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
mental health centers provide that keep
 
05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
children and adults also but keep
 
05:06:40.110 --> 05:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
children out of hospitals right so we're
 
05:06:41.470 --> 05:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
looking through that and the fast
 
05:06:43.270 --> 05:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
forward program so the fast forward
 
05:06:45.390 --> 05:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
program is a is a Medicaid design
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
program now we achieved coverage for
 
05:06:50.470 --> 05:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
this program in the Medicaid uh by doing
 
05:06:52.750 --> 05:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
a state plan Amendment so it is a
 
05:06:54.548 --> 05:06:54.558 align:start position:0%
combination you'll hear it described as
 
05:06:56.190 --> 05:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
Home and Community Based Services which
 
05:06:58.708 --> 05:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
in part it is but there is one straight
 
05:07:00.910 --> 05:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid service in there and that's uh
 
05:07:02.708 --> 05:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
wraparound Services that's a straight
 
05:07:05.590 --> 05:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid service it is uh provided in
 
05:07:07.310 --> 05:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
the context of the Fast Forward system
 
05:07:08.990 --> 05:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
but if that makes sense you know it is
 
05:07:11.750 --> 05:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
in some way ways it's Unique to um the
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system but in other ways it's a
 
05:07:16.110 --> 05:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
typical straight service High Fidelity
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
wraparound I will also say there's been
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of work in the state to
 
05:07:23.030 --> 05:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
figure out what High Fidelity wraparound
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
means and um I know uh representative is
 
05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
shaking her head she's been at the at
 
05:07:31.750 --> 05:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
the table for this since day one but it
 
05:07:34.868 --> 05:07:34.878 align:start position:0%
is a evidence-based intervention to wrap
 
05:07:36.990 --> 05:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
around the family you know provide the
 
05:07:38.430 --> 05:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
supports that are necessary to keep them
 
05:07:39.990 --> 05:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
out of a hospital keep them out of
 
05:07:42.190 --> 05:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
residential placements which are less
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
effective for them and way more
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
expensive so we have to figure out a way
 
05:07:47.110 --> 05:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
to get all kids access to services that
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
will keep them out of the hospital and
 
05:07:51.788 --> 05:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
out of acute psychiatric
 
05:07:53.628 --> 05:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
hospitalization followup one more
 
05:07:58.350 --> 05:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um is it not true um
 
05:08:01.230 --> 05:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
also that from like a Community Mental
 
05:08:03.310 --> 05:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
Health Center's point of
 
05:08:06.350 --> 05:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
view it's not really legal or at least
 
05:08:09.270 --> 05:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
ethical to provide one set of services
 
05:08:11.430 --> 05:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
to people with one kind of insurance but
 
05:08:13.270 --> 05:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
not provide it to other people with who
 
05:08:15.548 --> 05:08:15.558 align:start position:0%
didn't have the same kind of insurance
 
05:08:18.070 --> 05:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
so that puts me Community Mental Health
 
05:08:21.590 --> 05:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
Centers sometimes in the bind of um
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
either legally having to or feeling like
 
05:08:25.270 --> 05:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
they should provide the same kind of
 
05:08:28.150 --> 05:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
services even though there's no um
 
05:08:29.868 --> 05:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
reimbursement through these private
 
05:08:31.948 --> 05:08:31.958 align:start position:0%
insurances and they are you know I'll
 
05:08:33.628 --> 05:08:33.638 align:start position:0%
let folks behind me speak about it but
 
05:08:36.150 --> 05:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
they are providing those Services um
 
05:08:38.030 --> 05:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's sort of part of the $2 million
 
05:08:40.150 --> 05:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned that there are private
 
05:08:41.910 --> 05:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
insurance uh there are kids who have
 
05:08:43.868 --> 05:08:43.878 align:start position:0%
private insurance that are being served
 
05:08:45.868 --> 05:08:45.878 align:start position:0%
by the fast forward with State dollars
 
05:08:47.190 --> 05:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
and same thing with the Community Mental
 
05:08:48.868 --> 05:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
Health Center I think it's just sort of
 
05:08:50.230 --> 05:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
budgeted because we know that these kids
 
05:08:53.708 --> 05:08:53.718 align:start position:0%
are there thank you representative
 
05:08:57.270 --> 05:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
05:09:00.430 --> 05:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just for clarity
 
05:09:02.548 --> 05:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
um we were provided with a memo I think
 
05:09:04.190 --> 05:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
all of us who sit on this committee are
 
05:09:05.510 --> 05:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
well aware that there have been a
 
05:09:08.350 --> 05:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
proliferation of study committees over
 
05:09:09.868 --> 05:09:09.878 align:start position:0%
the last few years
 
05:09:12.628 --> 05:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
to address what it we all perceive as a
 
05:09:15.670 --> 05:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
very real problem uh am I right in
 
05:09:15.680 --> 05:09:16.788 align:start position:0%
very real problem uh am I right in
thinking

05:09:16.788 --> 05:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:09:22.190 --> 05:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
difference is that this particular study
 
05:09:22.200 --> 05:09:23.708 align:start position:0%
difference is that this particular study
period

05:09:23.708 --> 05:09:23.718 align:start position:0%
period
 
05:09:26.230 --> 05:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
study um
 
05:09:26.240 --> 05:09:28.270 align:start position:0%
study um
is

05:09:28.270 --> 05:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:09:28.280 --> 05:09:29.868 align:start position:0%
is
um

05:09:29.868 --> 05:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:32.708 --> 05:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
directed much more narrowly to a
 
05:09:35.310 --> 05:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
specific po population in a specific
 
05:09:40.030 --> 05:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
issue than have um the broad committees
 
05:09:42.270 --> 05:09:42.280 align:start position:0%
in the past yeah we we were quite
 
05:09:43.910 --> 05:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
explicit in the duties for that very
 
05:09:45.788 --> 05:09:45.798 align:start position:0%
reason I mean we're really trying to get
 
05:09:48.390 --> 05:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
wrap our heads around this um both to
 
05:09:50.150 --> 05:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
make sure kids get what they need and
 
05:09:52.868 --> 05:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
also to you know start reduce you know
 
05:09:55.350 --> 05:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
address the high budget we have in the
 
05:09:57.788 --> 05:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health uh Ledger
 
05:09:59.910 --> 05:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
on with Medicaid so yeah we are quite
 
05:10:02.470 --> 05:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
detailed and this is a quite specific um
 
05:10:04.030 --> 05:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
set of Duties that the committee will be
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
looking at thank you and just one
 
05:10:08.830 --> 05:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
followup followup um and and as you were
 
05:10:11.150 --> 05:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
giving your your testimony you referred
 
05:10:14.310 --> 05:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
at least once to um the need for
 
05:10:17.948 --> 05:10:17.958 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight and I wonder as I
 
05:10:19.948 --> 05:10:19.958 align:start position:0%
read this it appears to be more of a
 
05:10:23.310 --> 05:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
study than ongoing oversight so I was
 
05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
looking through there's no it it ends
 
05:10:27.470 --> 05:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
with the end of this legislature so it's
 
05:10:29.070 --> 05:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
a it's a one
 
05:10:32.110 --> 05:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
time with an end and so what yes that's
 
05:10:33.750 --> 05:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
correct what I meant by legislative
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
oversight is that there folks are
 
05:10:36.910 --> 05:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
already meeting and it is important that
 
05:10:38.708 --> 05:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
we just sort of keep them at the table
 
05:10:40.430 --> 05:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
and have a me ISM to keep them at the
 
05:10:42.628 --> 05:10:42.638 align:start position:0%
table thank you very much for that
 
05:10:45.470 --> 05:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
clarification it makes me feel much more
 
05:10:47.350 --> 05:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
like I understand what's going on yeah
 
05:10:47.360 --> 05:10:49.470 align:start position:0%
like I understand what's going on yeah
representative

05:10:49.470 --> 05:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:10:51.750 --> 05:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
McCay thank you Mr
 
05:10:53.590 --> 05:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I
 
05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:02.190 --> 05:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
Senator I'm a little bit confused about
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
the scope of this committee it says to
 
05:11:08.788 --> 05:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
study emergency mental health services
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
so on
 
05:11:12.590 --> 05:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
and under the duties it talks about
 
05:11:17.510 --> 05:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
health laws insurance coverage claims
 
05:11:20.750 --> 05:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
data lack of coverage which I'm not sure
 
05:11:23.868 --> 05:11:23.878 align:start position:0%
what that means whether that's insurance
 
05:11:26.590 --> 05:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
coverage and parity
 
05:11:30.310 --> 05:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
compliance I don't see anything in here
 
05:11:34.270 --> 05:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
about uh Sur the actual Services
 
05:11:37.868 --> 05:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
provided for children so it's confusing
 
05:11:40.708 --> 05:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
to me that that are we really talking
 
05:11:44.430 --> 05:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
about essentially Assurance coverage or
 
05:11:45.510 --> 05:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
is this
 
05:11:48.470 --> 05:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
a committee that's looking at the
 
05:11:52.430 --> 05:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
serious problem of lack of services for
 
05:11:54.430 --> 05:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
those children thank you for that
 
05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
question I think it sort of gets to
 
05:11:57.430 --> 05:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's question the
 
05:11:59.150 --> 05:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
name of the study committee is sort of a
 
05:12:01.070 --> 05:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
hold over from the prior version of the
 
05:12:03.548 --> 05:12:03.558 align:start position:0%
bill but really what we are looking at
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
is you know do children in who have
 
05:12:08.708 --> 05:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
private insurance have access to the
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
same bre and type of services that
 
05:12:13.590 --> 05:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
children in the Medicaid system have
 
05:12:15.708 --> 05:12:15.718 align:start position:0%
it's really that discreet issue just
 
05:12:17.590 --> 05:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
making sure we have parody there and I
 
05:12:19.910 --> 05:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
think in some cases with some carriers
 
05:12:23.190 --> 05:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
we do some carriers we do not right I
 
05:12:25.150 --> 05:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
think as always there's many different
 
05:12:26.910 --> 05:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
players at the table here but we need to
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that every child I believe
 
05:12:31.070 --> 05:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
should have access to services so they
 
05:12:34.150 --> 05:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
don't have to wait in in e in the ER so
 
05:12:37.590 --> 05:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
it it really is focused on those uh you
 
05:12:40.670 --> 05:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
know that discrete issue of
 
05:12:43.548 --> 05:12:43.558 align:start position:0%
coverage other
 
05:12:46.910 --> 05:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Weber and just
 
05:12:49.070 --> 05:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
following up on your answer to uh
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
05:12:56.150 --> 05:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't it be true if we actually
 
05:13:00.310 --> 05:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
were able to be a little more uh
 
05:13:02.270 --> 05:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
understanding and proactive in the
 
05:13:04.548 --> 05:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage or the payment side
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
of things we might actually achieve
 
05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
greater servic availability because we
 
05:13:16.230 --> 05:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
would have um a more stable way of
 
05:13:18.190 --> 05:13:18.200 align:start position:0%
funding it that's
 
05:13:18.200 --> 05:13:19.708 align:start position:0%
funding it that's
correct

05:13:19.708 --> 05:13:19.718 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:13:21.830 --> 05:13:21.840 align:start position:0%

05:14:26.590 --> 05:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
support of Senate Bill
 
05:14:29.190 --> 05:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
411 um as you just heard so eloquently
 
05:14:31.310 --> 05:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
by Senator Whitley Senate Bill 411 is a
 
05:14:34.750 --> 05:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
continuation of a multi-year effort from
 
05:14:37.230 --> 05:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um bipartisan
 
05:14:39.430 --> 05:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
legislators um the department of of
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
Health and Human ins services and uh
 
05:14:46.270 --> 05:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers to um come up with
 
05:14:50.230 --> 05:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
the solution for um the lack of coverage
 
05:14:51.788 --> 05:14:51.798 align:start position:0%
for certain services in the children's
 
05:14:54.190 --> 05:14:54.200 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health space and additionally
 
05:14:56.190 --> 05:14:56.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that those cover that those
 
05:14:58.868 --> 05:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
services that are hopefully now going to
 
05:15:01.990 --> 05:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
be covered um continue to be covered and
 
05:15:04.430 --> 05:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
continue to be available to the entirety
 
05:15:06.628 --> 05:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
of the gred state children
 
05:15:10.548 --> 05:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
population um as you also so eloquently
 
05:15:12.510 --> 05:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
heard from Senate Senator Whitley this
 
05:15:15.628 --> 05:15:15.638 align:start position:0%
is a um Senate Bill 411 was an attempt
 
05:15:18.390 --> 05:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
to finish the work um that was done
 
05:15:21.190 --> 05:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
around Senate Bill 70 back in
 
05:15:24.190 --> 05:15:24.200 align:start position:0%
2022 um it additionally improved
 
05:15:26.030 --> 05:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
definitions around Behavioral Health
 
05:15:29.948 --> 05:15:29.958 align:start position:0%
crisis services and a a Litany of other
 
05:15:33.110 --> 05:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
services it's been um amended to become
 
05:15:34.628 --> 05:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
a study committee after the Department
 
05:15:36.628 --> 05:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
of Insurance issued a bulletin um that
 
05:15:38.070 --> 05:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
solved some of the issues that were
 
05:15:39.430 --> 05:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
raised in the original version of the
 
05:15:44.110 --> 05:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
bill um but uh fast forward and those
 
05:15:46.190 --> 05:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
non-clinical um intensive care
 
05:15:47.750 --> 05:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
coordination Services still remain
 
05:15:49.910 --> 05:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
non-covered by many private insurance
 
05:15:52.990 --> 05:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
carriers um those services are offered
 
05:15:56.190 --> 05:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
to any child in New Hampshire um and
 
05:15:58.510 --> 05:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
when insurance does not cover them their
 
05:16:00.190 --> 05:16:00.200 align:start position:0%
private insurance does not cover them or
 
05:16:02.868 --> 05:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
those children do not rise to the level
 
05:16:05.270 --> 05:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
of Acuity that would give them coverage
 
05:16:06.948 --> 05:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
under the state's
 
05:16:09.910 --> 05:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
hccsd U Medicaid Program
 
05:16:12.430 --> 05:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
um the state Bureau for children's
 
05:16:14.190 --> 05:16:14.200 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health covers the cost of
 
05:16:17.190 --> 05:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
those Services um and so what the study
 
05:16:19.350 --> 05:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
committee is tasked with um which is
 
05:16:21.030 --> 05:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
different than what the previous study
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
committees that are outlined in the um
 
05:16:26.788 --> 05:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
memo that you received uh what this
 
05:16:29.190 --> 05:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
committee is tasked with is the very
 
05:16:29.200 --> 05:16:30.750 align:start position:0%
committee is tasked with is the very
narrow

05:16:30.750 --> 05:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
05:16:34.390 --> 05:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
um task of of reviewing the coverage for
 
05:16:38.470 --> 05:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
those children who are impacted by uh s
 
05:16:41.350 --> 05:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
severe mental health disorders um and
 
05:16:44.190 --> 05:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
need this type of uh coverage for
 
05:16:46.990 --> 05:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
services um when these services are
 
05:16:49.670 --> 05:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
covered more clinicians more providers
 
05:16:51.150 --> 05:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
are able to offer services at a
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
community- based level and that one
 
05:16:56.830 --> 05:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
offers better outcomes for children and
 
05:16:59.670 --> 05:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
two reduces the burden for those higher
 
05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
level of services such as fast forward
 
05:17:03.868 --> 05:17:03.878 align:start position:0%
or High Fidelity wraparound and reduces
 
05:17:06.350 --> 05:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
the burden on our emergency rooms so in
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
in theory would reduce the emergency
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
room board in crisis which was initially
 
05:17:13.590 --> 05:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
way back in 2022 the the reason Senate
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 70 was
 
05:17:17.708 --> 05:17:17.718 align:start position:0%
brought um and so that is the most
 
05:17:18.910 --> 05:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
important reason for this study
 
05:17:21.590 --> 05:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee to help address the need for
 
05:17:25.788 --> 05:17:25.798 align:start position:0%
services in our communities um need for
 
05:17:28.590 --> 05:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
um our state to be able to have those
 
05:17:31.350 --> 05:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
dollars that are currently going towards
 
05:17:33.990 --> 05:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
um payment for services that should be
 
05:17:35.788 --> 05:17:35.798 align:start position:0%
otherwise covered by private insurance
 
05:17:38.230 --> 05:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
can then be reallocated similarly into
 
05:17:39.670 --> 05:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
Community BAS Based
 
05:17:43.310 --> 05:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
Services um to that end I'm now going to
 
05:17:45.990 --> 05:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh just read some brief testimony from
 
05:17:48.070 --> 05:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
um some of our Advocates who are unable
 
05:17:49.868 --> 05:17:49.878 align:start position:0%
to be here but who have been impacted by
 
05:17:52.510 --> 05:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
this situation um so this is from one of
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
our Advocates Tim roor uh he says Dear
 
05:17:56.750 --> 05:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I write to you
 
05:17:58.230 --> 05:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of my daughter and the
 
05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
countless other children and families
 
05:18:01.390 --> 05:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
navigating mental health issues in solid
 
05:18:03.910 --> 05:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
support of Senate Bill 411 Senate Bill
 
05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
411 requires not uh commercial insurers
 
05:18:07.830 --> 05:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
to cover several community and
 
05:18:09.430 --> 05:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
hospital-based services for children
 
05:18:11.548 --> 05:18:11.558 align:start position:0%
experiencing a mental health emergency
 
05:18:13.150 --> 05:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
while these services are available
 
05:18:14.788 --> 05:18:14.798 align:start position:0%
through state funded programs such as
 
05:18:16.310 --> 05:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
fast forward they remain difficult to
 
05:18:18.390 --> 05:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
attain with long wait lists and limited
 
05:18:20.670 --> 05:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
availability to meet the growing demand
 
05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
expanding these types of services should
 
05:18:23.830 --> 05:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
not be the sole responsibility of the
 
05:18:25.590 --> 05:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
state and my daughter's case we are a
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
family with private insurance however
 
05:18:29.070 --> 05:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of coverage for some
 
05:18:31.868 --> 05:18:31.878 align:start position:0%
Services by private by commercial payers
 
05:18:33.948 --> 05:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
providers lack the financial resources
 
05:18:36.510 --> 05:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to expand access this means
 
05:18:37.830 --> 05:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
that for children like my daughter
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
recommended services are not quickly
 
05:18:41.868 --> 05:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
accessible leading to an inevitable and
 
05:18:44.190 --> 05:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
preventable degradation in her condition
 
05:18:45.990 --> 05:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
which now requires more intensive and
 
05:18:48.430 --> 05:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
expensive services to address commercial
 
05:18:49.868 --> 05:18:49.878 align:start position:0%
payers should be required to include
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
emergency services and intensive support
 
05:18:53.430 --> 05:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
necessary to keep children out of
 
05:18:55.430 --> 05:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms and able to access
 
05:18:57.470 --> 05:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
ongoing services in the community my
 
05:18:59.350 --> 05:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
daughter who spent a harrowing month at
 
05:19:01.270 --> 05:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital and is now in
 
05:19:02.830 --> 05:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
treatment out of state would currently
 
05:19:05.270 --> 05:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
be home and in a lower level of care had
 
05:19:07.230 --> 05:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
she had access to homebased therapeutic
 
05:19:09.708 --> 05:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
services therapeutic education programs
 
05:19:12.350 --> 05:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
and similar community services that have
 
05:19:14.510 --> 05:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
been recommended to her at the earliest
 
05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
sign that her condition was entering a
 
05:19:18.548 --> 05:19:18.558 align:start position:0%
crisis stage I encourage the committee
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
to support for Senate Bill 411 and
 
05:19:22.510 --> 05:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that commercial payers adequately
 
05:19:24.750 --> 05:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
cover and finance Services desperately
 
05:19:26.390 --> 05:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
needed by patients covered under this
 
05:19:28.590 --> 05:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
commercial their commercial
 
05:19:31.948 --> 05:19:31.958 align:start position:0%
plans and I have testimony from dein Ro
 
05:19:35.230 --> 05:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
he's 18 years old my name is Dean Ro I'm
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
a resident of Bedford I'm writing in

hearing person and many other things all
 
05:19:48.670 --> 05:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
of which I am very proud but out of
 
05:19:50.788 --> 05:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
every possible title or description I
 
05:19:52.868 --> 05:19:52.878 align:start position:0%
could apply to myself I am most proud of
 
05:19:55.310 --> 05:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
calling myself brother I'm writing to
 
05:19:57.430 --> 05:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
you today because my 12-year-old sister
 
05:19:59.990 --> 05:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
is suffering from mental illness after
 
05:20:02.030 --> 05:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
several emergency room visits in October
 
05:20:04.510 --> 05:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
and December of 2023 she ended up
 
05:20:06.430 --> 05:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
spending a month at Hamstead hospital
 
05:20:08.670 --> 05:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
and is now out of state at a therapeutic
 
05:20:11.310 --> 05:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
residential school it did not have to be
 
05:20:13.510 --> 05:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
this way she has been struggling for
 
05:20:15.510 --> 05:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
years but her last school year was
 
05:20:17.510 --> 05:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
particularly tough and she begged our
 
05:20:20.030 --> 05:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
family for help that we could not find I
 
05:20:21.990 --> 05:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
watched my parents struggle to find her
 
05:20:23.788 --> 05:20:23.798 align:start position:0%
the support that she needed all while
 
05:20:25.868 --> 05:20:25.878 align:start position:0%
her condition conditions steadily got
 
05:20:28.350 --> 05:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
worse my sister has been hospitalized
 
05:20:30.350 --> 05:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
multiple times we've had the police and
 
05:20:32.708 --> 05:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis at our home it has been
 
05:20:34.788 --> 05:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
hard to watch because it makes me and my
 
05:20:37.750 --> 05:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
parents feel hopeless and unsafe instead
 
05:20:39.750 --> 05:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
of focusing on studies at College during
 
05:20:42.310 --> 05:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
my first semester I spent a lot of time
 
05:20:43.910 --> 05:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
preoccupied and worried about what was
 
05:20:46.310 --> 05:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
happening at home her condition was so
 
05:20:48.390 --> 05:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
challenging that at Thanksgiving I
 
05:20:49.990 --> 05:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
regretted my decision to come home for
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
that holiday we spent Christmas day not
 
05:20:55.070 --> 05:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
together in our house with family and
 
05:20:57.110 --> 05:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
loved ones but opening gifts in a
 
05:21:00.350 --> 05:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency room I spend I
 
05:21:02.590 --> 05:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
support s sp11 because the Bill calls
 
05:21:04.830 --> 05:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
for emergency crisis services and
 
05:21:06.670 --> 05:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
supports that my sister has needed for
 
05:21:09.030 --> 05:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
far too long but couldn't get I'm
 
05:21:11.430 --> 05:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
thankful to the fa fastforward staff for
 
05:21:13.548 --> 05:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
the support they gave to my brother or
 
05:21:15.190 --> 05:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
my sister and my parents over the past
 
05:21:17.230 --> 05:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
few months and I'm relev to say that
 
05:21:19.070 --> 05:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
she's currently safe in a program that
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
meets her needs but it's at of state and
 
05:21:23.948 --> 05:21:23.958 align:start position:0%
it's still not enough and too often the
 
05:21:25.708 --> 05:21:25.718 align:start position:0%
kinds of services people tell us that
 
05:21:27.948 --> 05:21:27.958 align:start position:0%
our sister needs just don't exist or
 
05:21:30.510 --> 05:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
have long waits in New Hampshire I need
 
05:21:32.548 --> 05:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
my sister back I need her to feel like
 
05:21:35.070 --> 05:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
herself again I need my parents to feel
 
05:21:37.788 --> 05:21:37.798 align:start position:0%
supported and safe I need to focus on my
 
05:21:39.390 --> 05:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
studies and be the big brother that I
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
want to be without worrying that every

05:21:50.830 --> 05:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
help they need when they need
 
05:21:53.788 --> 05:21:53.798 align:start position:0%
it as a pediatric cancer survivor I saw
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
firsthand how fast access to high
 
05:21:58.990 --> 05:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
quality Care covered by Insurance made a
 
05:22:01.270 --> 05:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
difference I would not be here today if
 
05:22:03.150 --> 05:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't have the cancer treatment and
 
05:22:04.830 --> 05:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
the system that operated like a mental
 
05:22:06.708 --> 05:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
health and if I would not be here today
 
05:22:08.590 --> 05:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
if the cancer treatment system operated
 
05:22:10.670 --> 05:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
ated like our mental health system
 
05:22:12.270 --> 05:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
especially considering what is going
 
05:22:14.230 --> 05:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
through what going through my cancer and
 
05:22:17.470 --> 05:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
the aftermath makes it look easy it's a
 
05:22:19.470 --> 05:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
time that my sister got the same quality
 
05:22:22.150 --> 05:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
of care compassion coverage and services
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
just like anyone else facing a
 
05:22:26.070 --> 05:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
life-threatening health issue I hope you
 
05:22:28.868 --> 05:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
will join me and my family in support of
 
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
s sp411 for kids like my sister who
 
05:22:34.350 --> 05:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
deserve a chance at being healthy and
 
05:22:37.110 --> 05:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
healing thank you for your time today
 
05:22:39.830 --> 05:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any question
 
05:22:42.788 --> 05:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:22:46.150 --> 05:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
05:22:48.670 --> 05:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
chairman let let me try
 
05:22:48.680 --> 05:22:50.548 align:start position:0%
chairman let let me try
again

05:22:50.548 --> 05:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:22:53.750 --> 05:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
the what I'm hearing from both of those
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
letters are the severe difficulties of
 
05:23:00.390 --> 05:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
finding care when it's
 
05:23:04.150 --> 05:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
needed and I'm hoping that the committee
 
05:23:07.310 --> 05:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
that's studying this that seems to me
 
05:23:09.430 --> 05:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
the primary
 
05:23:13.310 --> 05:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
problem and resources are needed to
 
05:23:15.110 --> 05:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
support those
 
05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
programs but I would like us to
 
05:23:22.030 --> 05:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
hear exactly what's going on now in
 
05:23:24.190 --> 05:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
05:23:28.910 --> 05:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
services provided by the state uh for
 
05:23:32.070 --> 05:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
children 21 years and younger my
 
05:23:34.868 --> 05:23:34.878 align:start position:0%
experience has been that that's a
 
05:23:34.878 --> 05:23:36.430 align:start position:0%
experience has been that that's a
seriously

05:23:36.430 --> 05:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
05:23:39.670 --> 05:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
neglected population do you have any
 
05:23:44.590 --> 05:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
comments at all I sure um I think thank
 
05:23:46.190 --> 05:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
you so much for that point I think
 
05:23:48.070 --> 05:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
that's um exactly what this study
 
05:23:50.030 --> 05:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee will be looking into is
 
05:23:52.670 --> 05:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
identifying the gaps in what services
 
05:23:55.948 --> 05:23:55.958 align:start position:0%
are available um through the lens of
 
05:23:58.990 --> 05:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage and so uh we know
 
05:24:01.750 --> 05:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
that when these services are offered
 
05:24:04.030 --> 05:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
they are offered more to children with
 
05:24:05.788 --> 05:24:05.798 align:start position:0%
Medicaid because they're able to be
 
05:24:07.788 --> 05:24:07.798 align:start position:0%
reimbursed through Medicaid whereas
 
05:24:09.310 --> 05:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement may not be available
 
05:24:12.670 --> 05:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
through private insurance and so if um
 
05:24:15.030 --> 05:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
Insurance private insurance carriers
 
05:24:17.990 --> 05:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
reimburse at the same rate as Medicaid
 
05:24:19.788 --> 05:24:19.798 align:start position:0%
more services would be available and so
 
05:24:22.150 --> 05:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
that lack of services that you've uh
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
identified um as being available and is
 
05:24:27.270 --> 05:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
that is identified in these letters um
 
05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
would in theory be equal uh between um
 
05:24:33.510 --> 05:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
both the private and public
 
05:24:35.708 --> 05:24:35.718 align:start position:0%
markets follow
 
05:24:38.948 --> 05:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
up do you know what the state
 
05:24:43.030 --> 05:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
is doing at this time to take care of
 
05:24:47.548 --> 05:24:47.558 align:start position:0%
that uh lack of a facility availability
 
05:24:50.310 --> 05:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
I know they bought a hospital for
 
05:24:53.628 --> 05:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
children uh but I haven't heard any
 
05:24:56.110 --> 05:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
reports as to how that's
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
going um specifically with how Hamstead
 
05:25:02.990 --> 05:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
hospital is going I don't have specific
 
05:25:05.310 --> 05:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
information um about that but I'm happy
 
05:25:08.150 --> 05:25:08.160 align:start position:0%

05:25:11.948 --> 05:25:11.958 align:start position:0%

Hampshire insurance department however
 
05:26:32.430 --> 05:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
is clear that more work and more study
 
05:26:34.628 --> 05:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
is necessary specifically this
 
05:26:36.390 --> 05:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
legislation gives us an opportunity to
 
05:26:37.788 --> 05:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
look at coverage for High Fidelity

will 411 would enable New Hampshire can
 
05:27:14.070 --> 05:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
look at the best way to pay for these
 
05:27:16.230 --> 05:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
services and by expanding coverage and
 
05:27:17.910 --> 05:27:17.920 align:start position:0%

05:28:52.030 --> 05:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
whole Suite of services uh involved in
 
05:28:54.070 --> 05:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
fast Ford um our family peer support
 
05:28:56.910 --> 05:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
services are largely uh supporting the
 
05:28:58.270 --> 05:28:58.280 align:start position:0%
family through the whole Suite of
 
05:29:00.670 --> 05:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
services and I do think fast forward is
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
largely care coordination but I would
 
05:29:03.910 --> 05:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
defer to someone else to answer to the
 
05:29:05.750 --> 05:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
full Suite of services thank you thank
 
05:29:09.470 --> 05:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
you other questions
 
05:29:15.510 --> 05:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:18.070 --> 05:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Michelle
 
05:29:20.070 --> 05:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
Heaton from the New Hampshire insur New
 
05:29:24.708 --> 05:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:26.910 --> 05:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
department good afternoon for the record
 
05:29:28.230 --> 05:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
my name is Michelle heat and I'm the
 
05:29:29.670 --> 05:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
director of Life and Health at the New
 
05:29:32.190 --> 05:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
department um as many people have
 
05:29:35.868 --> 05:29:35.878 align:start position:0%
already testified this bill started off
 
05:29:37.190 --> 05:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
as something a little bit different and
 
05:29:39.788 --> 05:29:39.798 align:start position:0%
it started out more as an insurance
 
05:29:42.990 --> 05:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
mandate um I do want to level set here
 
05:29:45.430 --> 05:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
that mental health and Behavioral Health
 
05:29:47.708 --> 05:29:47.718 align:start position:0%
Services for children are covered
 
05:29:50.190 --> 05:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
benefits under Insurance in New
 
05:29:52.590 --> 05:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so we didn't believe that
 
05:29:55.788 --> 05:29:55.798 align:start position:0%
there was uh there wasn't a reason to
 
05:29:57.590 --> 05:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
put in this mandate because from our
 
05:30:00.110 --> 05:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
view these services are already covered
 
05:30:01.788 --> 05:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
however we recognize that there
 
05:30:03.868 --> 05:30:03.878 align:start position:0%
obviously was some issue here and we
 
05:30:06.150 --> 05:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
need to talk this through more so the
 
05:30:08.270 --> 05:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh the insurance commission
 
05:30:10.390 --> 05:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
put together a work group on this bill
 
05:30:13.390 --> 05:30:13.400 align:start position:0%
sb411 and that's where we started um
 
05:30:15.270 --> 05:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
having stakeholder
 
05:30:17.270 --> 05:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
conversations I think at least once a
 
05:30:19.510 --> 05:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
week for a while and that culminated in
 
05:30:21.350 --> 05:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
US issuing a bulletin and during those
 
05:30:23.190 --> 05:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
work sessions there was a lot of issues
 
05:30:26.548 --> 05:30:26.558 align:start position:0%
being brought up one is insurance
 
05:30:30.030 --> 05:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
coverage um I think there were also
 
05:30:32.430 --> 05:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
issues with providers not being in
 
05:30:34.430 --> 05:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
network there were issues about
 
05:30:36.070 --> 05:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce there was a lot of issues
 
05:30:38.350 --> 05:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
being brought up but what we were trying
 
05:30:40.310 --> 05:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
to focus on with this bulletin that we
 
05:30:43.030 --> 05:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
issued for 411 was the reimbursement
 
05:30:45.310 --> 05:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
piece because these are services that
 
05:30:47.430 --> 05:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
should be covered under insurance and it
 
05:30:49.628 --> 05:30:49.638 align:start position:0%
seemed that there was some disconnect
 
05:30:51.390 --> 05:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
between some of the providers and the
 
05:30:54.470 --> 05:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
carriers as to how to properly build for
 
05:30:56.190 --> 05:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
these services so we issued this
 
05:30:58.708 --> 05:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
bulletin that directed carriers to work
 
05:31:01.708 --> 05:31:01.718 align:start position:0%
with providers um and it identified a
 
05:31:05.070 --> 05:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
list of different CPT and hpix codes
 
05:31:07.070 --> 05:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
that would cover the bread of these
 
05:31:08.830 --> 05:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
types of services that we're talking
 
05:31:12.110 --> 05:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
about um and we encourage the carriers
 
05:31:15.670 --> 05:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
to reach out to the providers and um
 
05:31:18.990 --> 05:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
figure out if there are codes on the
 
05:31:20.670 --> 05:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
that we identifi through this work group
 
05:31:22.390 --> 05:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
that would be applicable that are not
 
05:31:24.830 --> 05:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
part of Provider contracts currently
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
working with the providers to update
 
05:31:28.430 --> 05:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
those contracts to make sure the
 
05:31:29.910 --> 05:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate codes are in there so that
 
05:31:32.750 --> 05:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
they can build for the services we also
 
05:31:34.390 --> 05:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
found out through the work group that
 
05:31:37.230 --> 05:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
there are a number of um service
 
05:31:38.788 --> 05:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
providers that are not in network with
 
05:31:41.310 --> 05:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
the different carriers so we directed
 
05:31:43.868 --> 05:31:43.878 align:start position:0%
the parties to start talking and seeing
 
05:31:45.670 --> 05:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
if there was a way for them to get into
 
05:31:47.470 --> 05:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
Network and explore all different types
 
05:31:50.830 --> 05:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
of reimbursement options not just V for
 
05:31:53.470 --> 05:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
service so we issued the bulletin um at
 
05:31:56.708 --> 05:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
the start of March and so it's our
 
05:31:58.868 --> 05:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
understanding that work is underway we
 
05:32:02.030 --> 05:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
have the insurance commissioner has also
 
05:32:05.190 --> 05:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
um revived the behavioral health
 
05:32:08.070 --> 05:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
advisory commission or committee that is
 
05:32:10.868 --> 05:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
a committee under the Department of
 
05:32:12.990 --> 05:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
Insurance that's specific to Commercial
 
05:32:15.470 --> 05:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
Insurance and it's a committee full of
 
05:32:18.150 --> 05:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh stakeholders in that industry and the
 
05:32:20.750 --> 05:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of this committee is to get
 
05:32:22.390 --> 05:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
together and talk through a lot of these
 
05:32:25.150 --> 05:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
issues um so that we can work out any
 
05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
kinks without having to do legislation
 
05:32:29.230 --> 05:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
and if there are issues identified that
 
05:32:31.548 --> 05:32:31.558 align:start position:0%
need to be resolved then they can advise
 
05:32:34.590 --> 05:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
the commissioner about um what issues
 
05:32:36.788 --> 05:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
they believe the insurance department
 
05:32:38.310 --> 05:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
should look into take some kind of
 
05:32:40.470 --> 05:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory action so we are actively
 
05:32:43.868 --> 05:32:43.878 align:start position:0%
meeting and um our plan is to have the
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
carriers come at one of our meetings in
 
05:32:48.788 --> 05:32:48.798 align:start position:0%
the near future to um talk about what
 
05:32:50.110 --> 05:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
they've done in response to this
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
bulletin as well as another bulletin
 
05:32:54.470 --> 05:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
that we had issued back in the fall so
 
05:32:56.390 --> 05:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of the background um
 
05:32:58.910 --> 05:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to take any questions any
 
05:33:02.510 --> 05:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:04.430 --> 05:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking the
 
05:33:08.590 --> 05:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
question I want to keep help me
 
05:33:11.590 --> 05:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
understand the insurance Market it's
 
05:33:14.350 --> 05:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
large employers small employers there's
 
05:33:17.430 --> 05:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicare there's many pieces to
 
05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
the pie including in that pie is Arisa
 
05:33:25.030 --> 05:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
and more and more plans are going to the
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
orisa model versus doing it through self
 
05:33:29.548 --> 05:33:29.558 align:start position:0%
which is self-funded versus doing it
 
05:33:32.230 --> 05:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
through small gr large groups would this
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
include Arisa
 
05:33:37.788 --> 05:33:37.798 align:start position:0%
plans so Arisa it have to be care
 
05:33:40.628 --> 05:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
careful because any group plan is bought
 
05:33:42.350 --> 05:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
through your employer and that applies
 
05:33:44.990 --> 05:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
to Arisa often times that term is used
 
05:33:47.430 --> 05:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
to describe self-funded plans and no
 
05:33:49.990 --> 05:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
this would not apply to self-funded
 
05:33:53.350 --> 05:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
plans it would apply to employer group
 
05:33:56.390 --> 05:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
plans that are commercial insurance so
 
05:33:59.110 --> 05:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
if I'm looking at the pi is
 
05:34:02.590 --> 05:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
100% what percentage of the pi is this
 
05:34:04.510 --> 05:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
bill going to apply to Commercial
 
05:34:06.868 --> 05:34:06.878 align:start position:0%
Insurance makes up about 30% of the
 
05:34:06.878 --> 05:34:08.230 align:start position:0%
Insurance makes up about 30% of the
market

05:34:08.230 --> 05:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
market
 
05:34:09.708 --> 05:34:09.718 align:start position:0%
the rest of the market is Medicare
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid TR care and self-funded you
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
know the commercial the commercial now
 
05:34:17.470 --> 05:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
that 30% how much is that is self funded
 
05:34:19.390 --> 05:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
no that's not including the self-funded
 
05:34:22.910 --> 05:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:26.030 --> 05:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
pie I am not sure I'd have to look that
 
05:34:29.310 --> 05:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
up okay if you could because I was at a
 
05:34:32.470 --> 05:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
meeting and what I was told was it
 
05:34:34.628 --> 05:34:34.638 align:start position:0%
probably is about 18 to 19% of the
 
05:34:36.788 --> 05:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
market actually we can control at the
 
05:34:38.430 --> 05:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
state level or it's either the control
 
05:34:40.350 --> 05:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
because ofisa or its governmental plans
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
and so forth and I just want to get
 
05:34:43.990 --> 05:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
clarification I just want to be clear to
 
05:34:46.868 --> 05:34:46.878 align:start position:0%
the committee to myself sort of level
 
05:34:48.590 --> 05:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
setting expectations of what we can and
 
05:34:50.948 --> 05:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
cannot do the other one too is in the
 
05:34:53.190 --> 05:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
insurance department there is something
 
05:34:53.200 --> 05:34:54.830 align:start position:0%
insurance department there is something
called

05:34:54.830 --> 05:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
called
 
05:34:58.910 --> 05:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
um adequacy if you will coverage so when
 
05:35:00.150 --> 05:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
you're looking for certain Medical
 
05:35:01.470 --> 05:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
Treatments or certain things like
 
05:35:02.868 --> 05:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
prescriptions and whatnot there has to
 
05:35:05.190 --> 05:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
be a certain level of adequacy for the
 
05:35:07.270 --> 05:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
patient to have adequate access to that
 
05:35:09.470 --> 05:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
care does that also translate into
 
05:35:12.190 --> 05:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
mental health yes so our Network
 
05:35:14.548 --> 05:35:14.558 align:start position:0%
adequacy requirements set the bare
 
05:35:18.110 --> 05:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
minimum of um adequacy for having um
 
05:35:20.070 --> 05:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
options available for services and that
 
05:35:22.230 --> 05:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
applies to all plans all commercial
 
05:35:24.670 --> 05:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
plans in New Hampshire and mental health
 
05:35:26.788 --> 05:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
services are included in our Network
 
05:35:26.798 --> 05:35:27.788 align:start position:0%
services are included in our Network
adequacy

05:35:27.788 --> 05:35:27.798 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
05:35:30.868 --> 05:35:30.878 align:start position:0%
requirements follow thank you so would
 
05:35:33.070 --> 05:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
you be so kind is to let me know send me
 
05:35:34.990 --> 05:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
an email or maybe the whole committee to
 
05:35:37.708 --> 05:35:37.718 align:start position:0%
where I can find that adequacy coverage
 
05:35:38.830 --> 05:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
because that's part of what I'm looking
 
05:35:40.830 --> 05:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
for too is being sure that if we need to
 
05:35:42.670 --> 05:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about adequacy coverage
 
05:35:44.670 --> 05:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
here per se and I want to be sure that
 
05:35:46.190 --> 05:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
we don't miss that opport are you
 
05:35:48.230 --> 05:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
talking about like the rules related to
 
05:35:50.750 --> 05:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
network adequacy the rules as well as
 
05:35:52.470 --> 05:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
the law particularly the rules because
 
05:35:54.510 --> 05:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
if the rules don't really apply to it
 
05:35:55.670 --> 05:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
because we could have a lot of things
 
05:35:57.750 --> 05:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
here this is really looking at more the
 
05:35:59.788 --> 05:35:59.798 align:start position:0%
coverage but part of that underneath is
 
05:36:03.070 --> 05:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
going to be the access issue of having
 
05:36:05.310 --> 05:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
enough adequacy for the patient actually
 
05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
get to a provider yes and I will couch
 
05:36:08.718 --> 05:36:10.070 align:start position:0%
get to a provider yes and I will couch
that

05:36:10.070 --> 05:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:36:13.750 --> 05:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
as Network adequacy puts into place the
 
05:36:15.708 --> 05:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
minimum of who you need to have in
 
05:36:19.110 --> 05:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
network However if those providers do
 
05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
not exist in New Hampshire or are
 
05:36:25.310 --> 05:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
unwilling to contract there is a way to
 
05:36:28.110 --> 05:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
meet the adequacy of the network even
 
05:36:29.628 --> 05:36:29.638 align:start position:0%
though those providers refuse to come
 
05:36:33.070 --> 05:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
into Network it's kind of
 
05:36:35.430 --> 05:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
um sorry it's the end of the day I'm
 
05:36:38.910 --> 05:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
blanking on the word but it's
 
05:36:42.750 --> 05:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
um if there are not enough providers in
 
05:36:45.190 --> 05:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
the state insurers cannot create those
 
05:36:47.230 --> 05:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
providers so that would not be counted
 
05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
against them as them not having an
 
05:36:52.030 --> 05:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
adequate Network as long as they are
 
05:36:54.670 --> 05:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
attempting to contract with the ones
 
05:36:57.510 --> 05:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
that are available thank you
 
05:36:59.510 --> 05:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh thank you Mr
 
05:37:00.830 --> 05:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
05:37:03.708 --> 05:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
with this information um I know that you
 
05:37:05.910 --> 05:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
work with um part of the commercial
 
05:37:09.310 --> 05:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
insurance Market um I'm just I'm trying
 
05:37:11.070 --> 05:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
to understand if the self-pay stuff
 
05:37:12.430 --> 05:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
would fall under this work that you've
 
05:37:14.590 --> 05:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
already undertaken with stakeholders and
 
05:37:16.590 --> 05:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
if it would fall underneath the special
 
05:37:18.230 --> 05:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
the commiss committee that' be made by
 
05:37:19.788 --> 05:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
the bill or if that would fall outside
 
05:37:23.110 --> 05:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:26.628 --> 05:37:26.638 align:start position:0%
them so the insurance department only
 
05:37:28.350 --> 05:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
regulates the commercial insurance and
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
our laws only apply to Commercial
 
05:37:32.350 --> 05:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
Insurance they do not apply to Medicare
 
05:37:36.510 --> 05:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um or self-funded plans so I
 
05:37:39.190 --> 05:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
believe this study committee is specific
 
05:37:41.548 --> 05:37:41.558 align:start position:0%
to insurance so it would be stuff that
 
05:37:43.788 --> 05:37:43.798 align:start position:0%
is within our purview and stuff that we
 
05:37:46.670 --> 05:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
are actively working on thank you that
 
05:37:48.990 --> 05:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
helps a lot representative
 
05:37:50.948 --> 05:37:50.958 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:37:53.310 --> 05:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so is it is
 
05:37:54.788 --> 05:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
it fair to
 
05:37:59.670 --> 05:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
say that um the insurance department is
 
05:38:02.470 --> 05:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill as it
 
05:38:04.948 --> 05:38:04.958 align:start position:0%
stands in that you would prefer not to
 
05:38:06.590 --> 05:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
have any legislation but to work
 
05:38:08.628 --> 05:38:08.638 align:start position:0%
directly with the Prov providers with
 
05:38:10.390 --> 05:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
the current legislation that's in in
 
05:38:13.390 --> 05:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
effect right now we take no position um
 
05:38:15.390 --> 05:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
and if you feel that this study
 
05:38:18.708 --> 05:38:18.718 align:start position:0%
committee is necessary you know great go
 
05:38:21.230 --> 05:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
ahead um but we do want to make sure you
 
05:38:23.070 --> 05:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
know that these are issues we are
 
05:38:25.070 --> 05:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
actively working on to the extent they
 
05:38:29.470 --> 05:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
fall within um our domain of Regulation
 
05:38:30.910 --> 05:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
and we are trying to convene
 
05:38:32.788 --> 05:38:32.798 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to address a lot of these
 
05:38:34.230 --> 05:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
issues however I think some of the stuff
 
05:38:35.830 --> 05:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's being brought up about like fast
 
05:38:37.390 --> 05:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
forward that is a Medicaid Program
 
05:38:39.868 --> 05:38:39.878 align:start position:0%
program that is outside of our
 
05:38:42.150 --> 05:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction followup so quick followup
 
05:38:44.868 --> 05:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
so my question is I I thought I heard
 
05:38:46.628 --> 05:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
you say that you would prefer not to
 
05:38:48.788 --> 05:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
have any legislation done but would
 
05:38:50.270 --> 05:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
prefer to work within the current
 
05:38:52.468 --> 05:38:52.478 align:start position:0%
legislation that is out there that was
 
05:38:54.830 --> 05:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
the um part of the reason why the
 
05:38:57.310 --> 05:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner reestablished the
 
05:38:59.910 --> 05:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
behavioral health advisory committee was
 
05:39:02.110 --> 05:39:02.120 align:start position:0%
so that we could work on these Solutions
 
05:39:04.590 --> 05:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders so that they didn't
 
05:39:06.830 --> 05:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
have to bring legislation each time they
 
05:39:08.830 --> 05:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to try to bring um address an
 
05:39:10.270 --> 05:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
issue we wanted to try to be more
 
05:39:12.150 --> 05:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
proactive get everyone in the room and
 
05:39:14.190 --> 05:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
try to work out some of these issues
 
05:39:15.990 --> 05:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
however if we identify something that
 
05:39:19.510 --> 05:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know clearly needs a legislative fix
 
05:39:21.548 --> 05:39:21.558 align:start position:0%
um you know we would be happy to work
 
05:39:24.670 --> 05:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
with all the stakeholders and you know
 
05:39:28.310 --> 05:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
bring that to everyone in the future
 
05:39:28.320 --> 05:39:29.468 align:start position:0%
bring that to everyone in the future
representative

05:39:29.468 --> 05:39:29.478 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:39:32.548 --> 05:39:32.558 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr G just to be clear
 
05:39:34.230 --> 05:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
th this study commission isn't going to
 
05:39:35.788 --> 05:39:35.798 align:start position:0%
be looking at stuff like fast forward
 
05:39:37.910 --> 05:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that right this is just
 
05:39:39.910 --> 05:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at at coverage and
 
05:39:42.468 --> 05:39:42.478 align:start position:0%
parity and things of that nature
 
05:39:45.230 --> 05:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
correct I believe the way this the
 
05:39:48.030 --> 05:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
legislation's currently written it says
 
05:39:50.310 --> 05:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
that it's specific to health insurance
 
05:39:52.830 --> 05:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
and coverage gaps under health insurance
 
05:39:54.990 --> 05:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
but I know some of um the testimony
 
05:39:56.390 --> 05:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
prior to me was talking about fast
 
05:39:58.430 --> 05:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
forward and some of these other programs
 
05:40:00.548 --> 05:40:00.558 align:start position:0%
the high fideli wraparound is part of
 
05:40:02.750 --> 05:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
the Fast Forward which is a Medicaid
 
05:40:05.150 --> 05:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
Program which includes social services
 
05:40:06.868 --> 05:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
that are not MediCal Services that are
 
05:40:09.390 --> 05:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
typically reimbursed by health insurance
 
05:40:11.708 --> 05:40:11.718 align:start position:0%
so but it would not be studied as part
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
of this it does not believe so based on
 
05:40:14.320 --> 05:40:15.350 align:start position:0%
of this it does not believe so based on
what's

05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
what's
 
05:40:18.708 --> 05:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
written other questions representative
 
05:40:20.990 --> 05:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
Merchant follow up on representative
 
05:40:24.830 --> 05:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
McLean's question if Medicaid is covered
 
05:40:27.430 --> 05:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
which I think is 603 forward and that
 
05:40:30.150 --> 05:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
seems to be working somewhat well I
 
05:40:32.510 --> 05:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
think there some kinks in it that we
 
05:40:35.350 --> 05:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
have to work through is there any logic
 
05:40:36.990 --> 05:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
to kind of compare what the commercial
 
05:40:38.190 --> 05:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
Market market doing compared to the
 
05:40:40.750 --> 05:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Market to get a better sense of
 
05:40:42.990 --> 05:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
which one's actually working fairly well
 
05:40:44.310 --> 05:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
and if one's working better than the
 
05:40:46.590 --> 05:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
other trying to understand what we need
 
05:40:51.030 --> 05:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:55.390 --> 05:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
gap they're very different programs with
 
05:40:59.110 --> 05:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
very different purposes Medicaid is more
 
05:41:02.590 --> 05:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
of a social has Social Service aspects
 
05:41:04.910 --> 05:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
to it that health insurance does not
 
05:41:07.868 --> 05:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
health insurance is a for for-profit
 
05:41:09.670 --> 05:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
regulated market well not necessarily
 
05:41:11.948 --> 05:41:11.958 align:start position:0%
for-profit but there's a profit aspect
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
associated with it in a regulatory
 
05:41:15.948 --> 05:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
market and traditionally they have just
 
05:41:19.868 --> 05:41:19.878 align:start position:0%
covered very different areas so um
 
05:41:22.708 --> 05:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
that's one aspect of trying to get down
 
05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
to the issues that could be explored
 
05:41:28.310 --> 05:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
um I guess that's up to you guys to
 
05:41:29.750 --> 05:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
figure out if that's what you want us to
 
05:41:33.670 --> 05:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
do or not representative Missour yes
 
05:41:35.430 --> 05:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:41:38.030 --> 05:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
my question so in looking at the duties
 
05:41:42.030 --> 05:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
of this committee um it appears that so
 
05:41:48.830 --> 05:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
lines 13 through uh 23 address um the
 
05:41:51.510 --> 05:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
insurance questions that we've been
 
05:41:53.350 --> 05:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
asking and it sounds to me like you've
 
05:41:56.270 --> 05:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
answered a lot of them so the insurance
 
05:42:00.990 --> 05:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
part is covered and then lines one and
 
05:42:04.230 --> 05:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
then seven um address like the
 
05:42:06.430 --> 05:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
behavioral health Gap so I'm wondering
 
05:42:09.868 --> 05:42:09.878 align:start position:0%
if if those those two duties can be
 
05:42:09.878 --> 05:42:11.430 align:start position:0%
if if those those two duties can be
encompassed

05:42:11.430 --> 05:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
encompassed
 
05:42:14.150 --> 05:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the committee that representative
 
05:42:18.390 --> 05:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
Shapiro mentioned earlier so would you
 
05:42:22.150 --> 05:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
agree that that could be the case and
 
05:42:24.990 --> 05:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
this bill might be redundant with what's
 
05:42:27.350 --> 05:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
happening between you and that other
 
05:42:29.590 --> 05:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee that was mentioned previously
 
05:42:31.310 --> 05:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of these committees have
 
05:42:33.510 --> 05:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
overlapping purposes and are working on
 
05:42:35.390 --> 05:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of the same information and
 
05:42:37.590 --> 05:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
include pretty much a lot of the same
 
05:42:40.350 --> 05:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders as well so I think there
 
05:42:46.548 --> 05:42:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:49.868 --> 05:42:49.878 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think I would defer to you
 
05:42:51.670 --> 05:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
guys to figure out the best way to move
 
05:42:53.990 --> 05:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
forward and I know um there were some
 
05:42:56.390 --> 05:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
reasons why people thought this was more
 
05:42:58.230 --> 05:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
of a specific purpose than some of the
 
05:43:01.150 --> 05:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
other ones but I can see that there
 
05:43:05.110 --> 05:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
could be some overlap representative
 
05:43:07.868 --> 05:43:07.878 align:start position:0%
Weber I think actually the last
 
05:43:10.430 --> 05:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
statement really got at the nub of what
 
05:43:13.590 --> 05:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
my question was which was uh the issue
 
05:43:17.910 --> 05:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
of specific examination versus a broader
 
05:43:20.510 --> 05:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
approach to the
 
05:43:23.270 --> 05:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
subject other
 
05:43:30.468 --> 05:43:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:33.190 --> 05:43:33.200 align:start position:0%

you we' asked for 5 to seven minutes if
 
05:43:47.948 --> 05:43:47.958 align:start position:0%
you could shave that down a bit I'd
 
05:43:54.830 --> 05:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:56.910 --> 05:43:56.920 align:start position:0%

honesty is
 
05:44:54.190 --> 05:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
deplorable in May of 2021 my son began a
 
05:44:56.230 --> 05:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
series of trips to local hospitals for
 
05:44:58.230 --> 05:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
crisis mental health screenings the
 
05:44:59.948 --> 05:44:59.958 align:start position:0%
first time we were sent there after our

son sat in an emergency room for a week
 
05:45:04.350 --> 05:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
we were told we could take our son home
 
05:45:07.468 --> 05:45:07.478 align:start position:0%
in order to quote board from home while
 
05:45:09.670 --> 05:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
we waited for for a bed at Hamstead
 
05:45:11.788 --> 05:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
hospital we quickly found out that this
 
05:45:13.350 --> 05:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
was not true and there was no such
 
05:45:15.590 --> 05:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
status as bored from home when
 
05:45:16.990 --> 05:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
Christopher was discharged from the
 
05:45:18.788 --> 05:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
emergency room he was also removed
 
05:45:20.510 --> 05:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
permanently from the weight list for the
 
05:45:22.788 --> 05:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
mental health bed at that hospital that
 
05:45:25.070 --> 05:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
information came from Hamstead hospital
 
05:45:27.468 --> 05:45:27.478 align:start position:0%
I spoke with them directly over the next
 
05:45:28.868 --> 05:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
several months we returned to local
 
05:45:30.830 --> 05:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms looking for help for
 
05:45:32.468 --> 05:45:32.478 align:start position:0%
more times each time the weight
 
05:45:35.510 --> 05:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
increased one week then a week and a
 
05:45:37.670 --> 05:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
half then two weeks the second and third
 
05:45:39.868 --> 05:45:39.878 align:start position:0%
time we we would bring our son home
 
05:45:41.628 --> 05:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
after being told there was quote nothing
 
05:45:44.190 --> 05:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
available finally the fource time fourth
 
05:45:46.350 --> 05:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
time we refused to bring our son home
 
05:45:48.150 --> 05:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
our son was having psychotic events
 
05:45:49.990 --> 05:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
things were becoming scary at home he
 
05:45:52.350 --> 05:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
was running away he was fighting demons
 
05:45:54.628 --> 05:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
that weren't there he was hurting not
 
05:45:57.270 --> 05:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
only myself but other family members
 
05:45:59.430 --> 05:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
even trying to run through a picture
 
05:46:00.990 --> 05:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
window in our
 
05:46:03.830 --> 05:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
home at one point Christopher ran out of
 
05:46:06.030 --> 05:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
the emergency room of Parkland with my
 
05:46:08.510 --> 05:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
husband running after after him and not
 
05:46:11.468 --> 05:46:11.478 align:start position:0%
one person on the staff of Parkland
 
05:46:14.030 --> 05:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
responded my husband ran back inside to
 
05:46:15.590 --> 05:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
tell them what happened because no one
 
05:46:17.788 --> 05:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
seemed to see our son run away with his
 
05:46:20.468 --> 05:46:20.478 align:start position:0%
six and 1 half foot father in chasing
 
05:46:22.990 --> 05:46:23.000 align:start position:0%

05:48:52.030 --> 05:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
went through hell my husband and I were
 
05:48:53.708 --> 05:48:53.718 align:start position:0%
threatened to be filed on for neglect
 
05:48:55.310 --> 05:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
because we refused to pick our son up
 
05:48:56.788 --> 05:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
from an emergency
 
05:48:59.868 --> 05:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
room my husband was told he had to leave
 
05:49:01.868 --> 05:49:01.878 align:start position:0%
an emergency room because he was
 
05:49:05.270 --> 05:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
aerating our son's issues I heard a
 
05:49:07.110 --> 05:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
security guard telling this consider
 
05:49:08.868 --> 05:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
outside of my room in the middle of the
 
05:49:12.070 --> 05:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
night one time these parents need to
 
05:49:15.310 --> 05:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
take their out of control children home
 
05:49:17.788 --> 05:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
and deal with the bad behavior my
 
05:49:19.788 --> 05:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
husband and I were thrilled that our we
 
05:49:21.468 --> 05:49:21.478 align:start position:0%
were told that our residential program
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
was located for our son but sad when it
 
05:49:26.030 --> 05:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
was out of state we were horrified to
 
05:49:28.990 --> 05:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
find out the residential was in
 
05:49:31.230 --> 05:49:31.240 align:start position:0%

05:49:36.670 --> 05:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
New England not just New Hampshire the
 
05:49:39.230 --> 05:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
insurance company refused to pay for
 
05:49:41.628 --> 05:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
anything and we refused to put them on a
 
05:49:41.638 --> 05:49:43.670 align:start position:0%
anything and we refused to put them on a
commercial

05:49:43.670 --> 05:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
05:49:47.350 --> 05:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:49.948 --> 05:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
$2,822 on a med flight to get our son
 
05:49:52.430 --> 05:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
safely to Mississippi so that he would
 
05:49:55.350 --> 05:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
not have any psychotic events while on a
 
05:49:58.830 --> 05:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
commercial flight and bringing TSA
 
05:50:01.310 --> 05:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
involved so not only as a mother but as
 
05:50:03.110 --> 05:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
a social worker I asked for each of you
 
05:50:06.868 --> 05:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
to support sb411 our children deserve
 
05:50:08.628 --> 05:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
better care and families need better
 
05:50:10.628 --> 05:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
support when faced with a mental health
 
05:50:13.350 --> 05:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
crisis I'd be happy to answer any
 
05:50:16.070 --> 05:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
05:50:20.030 --> 05:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman so I'm
 
05:50:24.110 --> 05:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
wondering if if you attribute any of the
 
05:50:28.590 --> 05:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
difficulties that your son had in
 
05:50:31.110 --> 05:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
receiving appropriate care with the fact
 
05:50:33.390 --> 05:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
that they had a developmental disability
 
05:50:37.430 --> 05:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
as well as a psychiatric illness
 
05:50:39.948 --> 05:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
yes I I I think there there's a big
 
05:50:43.430 --> 05:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
combination of it
 
05:50:46.628 --> 05:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you representative
 
05:50:50.468 --> 05:50:50.478 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
05:50:53.230 --> 05:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
for your testimony you you probably
 
05:50:55.150 --> 05:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
heard me
 
05:50:58.708 --> 05:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
complaining and you you answered my
 
05:51:01.948 --> 05:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
questions by pointing out your own
 
05:51:05.510 --> 05:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
experience and plus as a social worker
 
05:51:08.868 --> 05:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
and some of us here are also social
 
05:51:08.878 --> 05:51:10.750 align:start position:0%
and some of us here are also social
workers

05:51:10.750 --> 05:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
workers
 
05:51:14.788 --> 05:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
um I'm not against this bill but
 
05:51:18.230 --> 05:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
I'm what's getting to me is we're
 
05:51:21.628 --> 05:51:21.638 align:start position:0%
talking about peripheral issues and not
 
05:51:25.628 --> 05:51:25.638 align:start position:0%
about the basic issue which is lack of
 
05:51:29.270 --> 05:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
services and I'm not critical of the
 
05:51:32.468 --> 05:51:32.478 align:start position:0%
department either but I I would like to
 
05:51:37.548 --> 05:51:37.558 align:start position:0%
know maybe it's in um the committee that
 
05:51:39.868 --> 05:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
was mentioned maybe that's what they're
 
05:51:44.110 --> 05:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
going to do uh I'm hopeful but that I am
 
05:51:44.120 --> 05:51:45.310 align:start position:0%
going to do uh I'm hopeful but that I am
very

05:51:45.310 --> 05:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:51:47.788 --> 05:51:47.798 align:start position:0%
concerned about what you're talking
 
05:51:51.190 --> 05:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
about and that is that services are not
 
05:51:54.548 --> 05:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
available to some of the most vulnerable
 
05:51:58.230 --> 05:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
yes people in our society and that the
 
05:52:03.030 --> 05:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to know that and and
 
05:52:08.190 --> 05:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
and not the full you have a question
 
05:52:11.150 --> 05:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
represent would you
 
05:52:16.868 --> 05:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
believe that the importance of insurance
 
05:52:16.878 --> 05:52:18.230 align:start position:0%
believe that the importance of insurance
is

05:52:18.230 --> 05:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:52:20.110 --> 05:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
extremely uh
 
05:52:22.910 --> 05:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
significant but that the insurance is
 
05:52:26.150 --> 05:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
not useful if there's nothing to buy
 
05:52:29.868 --> 05:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
that there's no Services there and we
 
05:52:34.670 --> 05:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
need to know uh and frankly we're we're
 
05:52:37.190 --> 05:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
ahead of where we were
 
05:52:40.750 --> 05:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
but we're still hearing things that are
 
05:52:43.750 --> 05:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
disturbing to me and I think the
 
05:52:46.750 --> 05:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to know this thank you
 
05:52:50.070 --> 05:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
very much thank you other questions
 
05:52:52.548 --> 05:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
05:52:53.990 --> 05:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for sharing your
 
05:52:56.350 --> 05:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
testimony very sorry to hear all
 
05:52:58.708 --> 05:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
that I'm curious I'm not terribly
 
05:53:01.788 --> 05:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
familiar with our entire system and
 
05:53:04.030 --> 05:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
what what things are available for
 
05:53:07.310 --> 05:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
people I'm just curious maybe you know
 
05:53:10.110 --> 05:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't um a lot of this sounds
 
05:53:12.628 --> 05:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
like it costed a lot of money doesn't
 
05:53:15.270 --> 05:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
sound like the quality of care was all
 
05:53:18.948 --> 05:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
that great and I'm just curious could
 
05:53:22.270 --> 05:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
parents just relinquish their children
 
05:53:25.430 --> 05:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
to be Wards of the state is that a thing
 
05:53:26.990 --> 05:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
and and if they
 
05:53:30.750 --> 05:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
were would the would the quality of care
 
05:53:34.030 --> 05:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
be any less than what you received and
 
05:53:35.510 --> 05:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
would you still be able to visit your
 
05:53:40.230 --> 05:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
son I I just I'm I'm just curious could
 
05:53:42.468 --> 05:53:42.478 align:start position:0%
it get any worse than it is and if you
 
05:53:43.628 --> 05:53:43.638 align:start position:0%
were just
 
05:53:47.190 --> 05:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
to you know or or does the state kick
 
05:53:49.030 --> 05:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
people out onto the streets when they
 
05:53:50.948 --> 05:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
have the types of conditions your son
 
05:53:53.510 --> 05:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
does I just if you could shine a light
 
05:53:56.628 --> 05:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
on any of that for me that'd be great so
 
05:53:59.030 --> 05:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
our son is adopted from the foster care
 
05:54:01.190 --> 05:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
system he moved in with us when he was
 
05:54:03.788 --> 05:54:03.798 align:start position:0%
four and a half we adopted him a year
 
05:54:06.510 --> 05:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
later um I don't want to Pat us on on
 
05:54:06.520 --> 05:54:07.830 align:start position:0%
later um I don't want to Pat us on on
the

05:54:07.830 --> 05:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:54:10.230 --> 05:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
back but what the state of Massachusetts
 
05:54:14.590 --> 05:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
got was a therapeutic home from us and
 
05:54:16.948 --> 05:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
had we not adopted him I will guarantee
 
05:54:19.948 --> 05:54:19.958 align:start position:0%
you that child will e would either a be
 
05:54:21.788 --> 05:54:21.798 align:start position:0%
in a group home residential home for the
 
05:54:25.030 --> 05:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
rest of his life or he would be out on
 
05:54:30.990 --> 05:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:34.430 --> 05:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
answer as a social worker I did 18 years
 
05:54:36.390 --> 05:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
of child protection in the state of Mass
 
05:54:38.150 --> 05:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
CH it's and I can't tell you how many
 
05:54:41.708 --> 05:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
children were returned back to the state
 
05:54:44.030 --> 05:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
exactly for that they needed more
 
05:54:46.230 --> 05:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
services and parents didn't know what to
 
05:54:49.670 --> 05:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
do my story my family story this is not
 
05:54:53.190 --> 05:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
unique there this this story is the same
 
05:54:54.830 --> 05:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
over and over again just a different
 
05:54:57.788 --> 05:54:57.798 align:start position:0%
last name um at one point my husband and
 
05:55:01.628 --> 05:55:01.638 align:start position:0%
I had considered it it was a very brief
 
05:55:04.270 --> 05:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
consideration just because we wanted to
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
keep him safe he was said 17 he was
 
05:55:11.190 --> 05:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
acting out and he was at an age if he
 
05:55:14.910 --> 05:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
hurt somebody he was going to go to jail
 
05:55:17.070 --> 05:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
and then what
 
05:55:19.030 --> 05:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
happens he's just going to be taken
 
05:55:21.510 --> 05:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
advantage of
 
05:55:24.270 --> 05:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
so when we refused to bring him home it
 
05:55:26.350 --> 05:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
was so that we could get the services
 
05:55:28.430 --> 05:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
but a lot of parents are bullied by the
 
05:55:30.948 --> 05:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
system and are forced to take these kids
 
05:55:35.110 --> 05:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
home and then DCF or dcyf here gets
 
05:55:37.150 --> 05:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
involved um
 
05:55:39.468 --> 05:55:39.478 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question it could it
 
05:55:41.708 --> 05:55:41.718 align:start position:0%
could get a lot worse and it does for
 
05:55:44.430 --> 05:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
some families um I own a private
 
05:55:47.708 --> 05:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
practice I do tele Health in four states
 
05:55:49.990 --> 05:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
and I take phone calls all the time from
 
05:55:53.230 --> 05:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
people parents asking I don't know what
 
05:55:56.190 --> 05:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
to do and I just try to steer them in
 
05:55:58.910 --> 05:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
the right direction on who to call what
 
05:56:01.750 --> 05:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
to do and sometimes there in States I I
 
05:56:04.150 --> 05:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
don't I've never worked in so I'm online
 
05:56:05.990 --> 05:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
Googling as much information as I can
 
05:56:08.430 --> 05:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
about that state to learn as fast as I
 
05:56:13.628 --> 05:56:13.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:18.070 --> 05:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
is thank you other
 
05:56:20.190 --> 05:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
 
05:56:21.948 --> 05:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
05:56:24.270 --> 05:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Shapiro could I
 
05:56:25.830 --> 05:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
Prevail on you one more time for the
 
05:56:28.548 --> 05:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
blue sheet representative Weber you
 
05:56:29.868 --> 05:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
offered last week to look up on the
 
05:56:31.670 --> 05:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
online for me would you be willing to do
 
05:56:40.910 --> 05:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:43.910 --> 05:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
support okay three in support no one
 
05:56:57.708 --> 05:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:00.468 --> 05:57:00.478 align:start position:0%
you I have no other pink cards does
 
05:57:07.990 --> 05:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:10.030 --> 05:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
hi Michelle Merritt I'm back again from
 
05:57:11.628 --> 05:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
new Futures there were a couple of
 
05:57:13.190 --> 05:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
questions that I thought I might be able
 
05:57:15.868 --> 05:57:15.878 align:start position:0%
to help answer particularly around the
 
05:57:17.750 --> 05:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health crisis commission what
 
05:57:20.510 --> 05:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
the scope of that commission is um I sit
 
05:57:22.430 --> 05:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
on it uh along with representative
 
05:57:24.830 --> 05:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
Shapiro and representative Merchant um
 
05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
there is not overlap in the duties and
 
05:57:29.110 --> 05:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of that commission with
 
05:57:30.590 --> 05:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about with this
 
05:57:32.670 --> 05:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation that
 
05:57:35.070 --> 05:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
bill is narrow to be looking at the
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
financing for the 988 system which is a
 
05:57:41.070 --> 05:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
crisis hotline um and to determine how
 
05:57:42.468 --> 05:57:42.478 align:start position:0%
the state can continue funding it
 
05:57:44.750 --> 05:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
because federal funds are lapsing it
 
05:57:47.628 --> 05:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
really is not in the the realm of the
