hearings yeah these are the four things
 
00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 align:start position:0%
okay that's what I'm missing one of
 
00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 align:start position:0%
those uh there here here's the pile with

whichever when you don't have you
can

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
confusing a game at summer camp that was
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
like that this shows you how invaluable
 
00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 align:start position:0%
Christina is she when she's homesick we
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:58.560 --> 00:06:52.710 align:start position:0%
 
her

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here um this is
 
00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee on Senate Bill 236 it's
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
a retained bill out of the committee on
 
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and elderly
 
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
Affairs uh as as stated in the bill
 
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
itself it's an act establishing a
 
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
committee to study nonprofit
 
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
organizations Contracting with the
 
00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
for children's
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
services um is anyone here to speak on
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
the bill or does anyone want to
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
comment representative
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
Weber I think I'd very much like to talk
 
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
among ourselves first because this is
 
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
not a public hearing it's a public
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
meeting um and what I wanted to say just
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
as as a by introduction is the bill is
 
00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
limited not in its title but in its in
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
its uh body with respect to insurance
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
coverage and we had a great deal of very
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony at the original
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
hearing which spoke to the uh difficult
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
that some organizations which provide
 
00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
much needed services in the state are
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
having getting insurance coverage at a
 
00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:12.759 align:start position:0%
rate that they can afford and they're
 
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
supplying critical Services usually to
 
00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
very vulnerable uh
 
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
populations so
 
00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
um I will just State my own position I
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
don't know why we didn't just pass this
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
and get the work
 
00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:31.879 align:start position:0%
started last turn but um I I have no
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
objection to hearing from to hearing
 
00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
from people but uh it seems to me that
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
um you know the if if there is more to
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
say that's great but I just don't want
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
to sort of start the public hearing
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
process all over again from square one
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you representative
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
wber any other committee members sub
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee members want to comment before
 
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
we hear from someone else
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
or good okay I'm sorry you you were
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
do good morning good morning my name is
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
Emily Lawrence and I am the deputy
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
advocacy director with Waypoint and
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
Waypoint was working with Senator
 
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
Chanley on bringing this bill forward um
 
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
in result because of the concerns for
 
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
our ISO Foster Care Program Waypoint
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
runs a small ISO Foster Care Program
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
which provides wound Services um for
 
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
children with some of the most intensive
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
needs these are some of our most
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children involved in the
 
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
child welfare system and this service
 
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
provides them with the opportunity to
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
remain um hopefully in their home
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
communities or at least in their home
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
state and get community-based Services
 
00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:51.079 align:start position:0%
um it's an alternative to sending kids
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
to residential facilities which as you
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
may know the state is really trying to
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
move away from doing that and serve
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
children in their own communities
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we've had um issues as
 
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
that's why the bill came forward with um
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
our insurance we've lost our umbrell
 
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
policy we currently do have a million
 
00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:13.959 align:start position:0%
doll liability policy um we know that in
 
00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:16.279 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate event that we were
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
involved in a case that sometimes those
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
damages are much greater um and often
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
entities will will go after the
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofits um because the state has a
 
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:29.240 align:start position:0%
cap so it's not that they don't go after
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
the state as well but um and so we did
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
look around our we've had our broker
 
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
looking for Alternatives we were able to
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
get a quote from birkshire hathway for
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
our eight bed program it was double the
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
cost of what we pay for the entirety of
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
all of our other programs so that's
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
really not a sustainable affordable
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
option for us and while we are a small
 
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
program we're one of many that will be
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
affected by this
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately we're afraid that it
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
would be kind of like death by a
 
00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
Thousand Cuts of these little programs
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
that provide these really critical
 
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
services and as it is we don't have
 
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
enough of them in the state um as you
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
may have seen the office of the child
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
Advocates recent report on children that
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
were sent um to a residential facility
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
in Tennessee there were really um
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunate concerns with their care
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
there and we were lucky to bring them
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
home but the reason that they were sent
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
there is that we can't find appropriate
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
care in the state because we don't have
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
that and we are working on building it
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
up but it is these critical services
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
that we need um we also met we did meet
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
with the insurance commissioner and his
 
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
staff who are here um to discuss this
 
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
issue we know this is something that
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
they are looking at as well and talking
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
with some of the um National entities
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
looking at this issue we are not opposed
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
to different options we just want to
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that it is examined and we can
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
figure out a solution to this because
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
from a business perspective alone it's
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
not sustainable for us to continue and
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
um as it is the only insurer right now
 
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
that ensures these types of
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
organizations is
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia um as you all know there is
 
00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
a large lawsuit against the senuna Youth
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
Services Center and in that lawsuit over
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
100 other entities have been named and
 
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
almost all of them have Philadelphia for
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
their insur so the likelihood that
 
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia may start pulling back
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
which they have done I I believe in New
 
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
York they've completely withdrawn from
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
coverage of some of these programs um is
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
real and in that instance there would be
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
nothing for us so um and and we're
 
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
required by the state to maintain um
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
insurance as well in order to to do
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
these contracted
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
Services okay thank
 
00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:58.600 align:start position:0%

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.949 align:start position:0%
you questions from committee members or
com

00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
com
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
comments that gave a good overview thank
 
00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:03.590 align:start position:0%
comments that gave a good overview thank
you

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
sure thank you thank you so much for
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
your time oh I will I'll just share that
 
00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
last year in um West Virginia they
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
passed a law that um required all um its
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
child placing agencies which when I read
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
the definition would be akin to what
 
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
Waypoint does um to to maintain a mill
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
million dollar or more insurance policy
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
no less than a million and then they
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
allowed um they they were uh put in
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
statute that they would have a limit of
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
amount so yeah question sure
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
representative kushman what is the diff
 
00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:46.519 align:start position:0%
what is can you tell me what umbrella
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
coverage versus liability coverage yeah
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
I can tell you my limited knowledge I'm
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
not um so for example we have um
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
liability coverage is your base coverage
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
for ISS ues and then umbrella covers if
 
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to go above that so it's
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
almost like an extra layer and perhaps
 
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
someone else could explain it better but
 
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of it thank
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for I'm sorry
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
ma'am uh what was your last name it's
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
Lawrence l l yep R nce yes okay great

thank you thank you very much for being
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
morning would either of you folks in the
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
audience like to testify I know you Ser
 
00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Insurance and you
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
gave us a letter from the commissioner
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
but uh I don't know if you want to you
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
or um sure I can elaborate on that uh my
 
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
name is James Fox under property and
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
Cassy director at the New Hampshire
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
insurance department this is Emily dhy
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
she's the property and Cas the attorney
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
at the Department um as to your question
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh about umbrella Insurance like if you
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
have a homeowner's policy that's your
 
00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
your your primary layer of insurance and
 
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
then if you're if you have assets you
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
you know you want to protect assets
 
00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759 align:start position:0%
above what they'll sell you as a primary
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
layer so then you buy an umbrella layer
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
and that that basically is an umbrella
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
over all of your coverages that you have
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
so it's just a it's a higher level uh
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
higher layer of insurance so it kicks in
 
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
at like the $1 million level where your
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
whatever you buy and it's usually
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
cheaper so people usually do buy an
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
umbrella policy um uh
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
as to uh as to the bill um the the
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
department has also looked at the issue
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
of nonprofits ability to purchase
 
00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
insurance as a general matter uh the
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
hard the markets are hardening which
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
means it's harder to get insurance um it
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
has a lot to do with uh property losses
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
across the country and then reinsurers
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
pulling back from having reinsurance and
 
00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
if you know the Frontline insurers are
 
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
you know the ones you know am those
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
companies and then above that are the
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
reinsurers who basically insure the
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and so there's less
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
reinsurance out there so there's less
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
capacity to sell so then ultimately the
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
the market hardens so it's harder to
 
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
find coverages now in some areas we're
 
00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:11.959 align:start position:0%
not as worried about that but I know the
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner in this particular area for
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
nonprofits due to the critical Services
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
they provide he is concerned about it
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
and uh he is uh committed to um
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
attempting to find a solution by working
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
with all the stakeholders um if there is
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee we absolutely would be uh
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
here to support the sub committee and
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
provide as much information as we can um
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
so we did submit a letter uh which are
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
the actual commissioner's words so uh I
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
would rely on that letter but I would
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
say uh the department is 100% not
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to this and we are we would be
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
um a active participant in in the
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to try to find um a
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
solution um that works for everyone from
 
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
industry to the nonprofits sure the
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner's comment is basically on
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
supportive of the concept he said that I
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
do believe it would be beneficial to
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
have a structured group of stakeholders
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
and policy makers to join us to form a
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
strategy to move forward so I that says
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
members okay thank you well thank you
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
very much for being here thank you for
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
this this letter and information y
 
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.189 align:start position:0%
this this letter and information y
representative

00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
Weber I just had a comment based on all
 
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
of that um
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
I see no problem with the bill as
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
drafted I think that one of the things
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
we might want to suggest to the
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
speaker is that in appointing the two
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
members of the House of
 
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh I would very much
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
hope that one of them came from the
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee which has a great
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
deal more
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
um with insurance issues and
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
I frankly have no idea why this bill
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
came to us because the underlying issue
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
of children's services tend to go to the
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee so if
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
there was to be a change I would suggest
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we specified two members of the
 
00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
House Representatives appointed by the
 
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House one from Commerce
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
and one from children and family law but
 
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
if the members of the subcommittee don't
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
feel that that specificity is necessary
 
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
I I I don't insist on it I just make it
 
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
as a suggestion and it could be as
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
simple as an informal suggestion to the
 
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
speaker that's not uncommon right to
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
specify what where members on a
 
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
particular study committee should come
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
from no they they they do specify
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes and and sometimes they don't
 
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
okay but this one seems particularly to
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
be outside of the Health and Human
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
Services baileywick it it the children
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
and family law tend to deal with
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice matters and juvenile
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
protection matters and the Commerce
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
Committee tends to deal with insurance
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
matters and I have
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
seen uh the uh Mr Fox spoke of a whole
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
bunch of stakeholders and I have seen
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
very very effective small
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
committees uh that
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
have assembled all of the relevant
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in front of them and taken
 
00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
their their testimony and their input so
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
I don't see the need for a gigantic
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
commission which is nowhere near as
 
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
Nimble as a committee and will take much
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
longer to set up I think I think we
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
should keep this
 
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
structure and and either leave it as it
 
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
is or be it slightly more
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
specific okay representative kushman
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm in total agree
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
um with you representative Weber um I
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
don't think we even need an amendment I
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
think if we you know even put it in
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
report that we recommend um you know
 
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
once the bill comes out of the full
 
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
committee um that those two members
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's completely
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate okay thank you thank you
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee and
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh along with representative kushman I
 
00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:46.039 align:start position:0%
recommend that we put in our report that
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
the committee recommends somebody from
 
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
children and family law and somebody
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
from uh Commerce but that will be at the
 
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
discretion of the
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
speaker okay a motion has been made is
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
there a second to represent
 
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:05.430 align:start position:0%
there a second to represent
representative

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
not okay is there any other discussion
 
00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
motion okay all those in favor I do we
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
don't need a roll call for something
 
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039 align:start position:0%
like this to we or no not usually I
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
thought we needed a roll call the final
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
thing okay all right um there are only
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
four of us here so is it unanimous I do
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
I need to call of all
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
I I think if you just specify that it
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
was that the members were pulled and it
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
was unanimous if that's helpful I I
 
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
think we need a record of who is here
 
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
because representative TZ is not sure
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I've been making some notes
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
here so you'd use the full committee
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
sheet I guess um that's the only I think
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
that if you just want to write in your
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
notes that okay all right the four of us
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
were present and all four of us voted
 
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:57.029 align:start position:0%
were present and all four of us voted
yes

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:59.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:21:59.470 --> 00:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
okay excellent so uh again the record
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%

00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
