above what they'll sell you as a primary
layer<00:15:11.279><c> so</c><00:15:11.480><c> then</c><00:15:11.600><c> you</c><00:15:11.800><c> buy</c><00:15:12.120><c> an</c><00:15:12.279><c> umbrella</c><00:15:12.759><c> layer</c>

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
layer so then you buy an umbrella layer
 

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.629 align:start position:0%
layer so then you buy an umbrella layer
and<00:15:13.199><c> that</c><00:15:13.399><c> that</c><00:15:13.560><c> basically</c><00:15:13.959><c> is</c><00:15:14.079><c> an</c><00:15:14.160><c> umbrella</c>

00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
and that that basically is an umbrella
 

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:16.350 align:start position:0%
and that that basically is an umbrella
over<00:15:14.880><c> all</c><00:15:15.000><c> of</c><00:15:15.120><c> your</c><00:15:15.320><c> coverages</c><00:15:15.759><c> that</c><00:15:15.920><c> you</c><00:15:16.079><c> have</c>

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
over all of your coverages that you have
 

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.790 align:start position:0%
over all of your coverages that you have
so<00:15:16.519><c> it's</c><00:15:16.680><c> just</c><00:15:16.880><c> a</c><00:15:17.360><c> it's</c><00:15:17.480><c> a</c><00:15:17.639><c> higher</c><00:15:17.920><c> level</c><00:15:18.560><c> uh</c>

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
so it's just a it's a higher level uh
 

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.269 align:start position:0%
so it's just a it's a higher level uh
higher<00:15:19.079><c> layer</c><00:15:19.440><c> of</c><00:15:19.600><c> insurance</c><00:15:20.519><c> so</c><00:15:20.680><c> it</c><00:15:20.839><c> kicks</c><00:15:21.079><c> in</c>

00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
higher layer of insurance so it kicks in
 

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:23.230 align:start position:0%
higher layer of insurance so it kicks in
at<00:15:21.440><c> like</c><00:15:21.560><c> the</c><00:15:21.600><c> $1</c><00:15:21.800><c> million</c><00:15:22.320><c> level</c><00:15:22.759><c> where</c><00:15:22.920><c> your</c>

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
at like the $1 million level where your
 

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.350 align:start position:0%
at like the $1 million level where your
whatever<00:15:23.519><c> you</c><00:15:23.639><c> buy</c><00:15:23.839><c> and</c><00:15:23.959><c> it's</c><00:15:24.079><c> usually</c>

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.790 align:start position:0%

00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
the market hardens so it's harder to

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.710 align:start position:0%
four of us here so is it unanimous I do
I<00:21:26.480><c> need</c><00:21:26.600><c> to</c><00:21:26.760><c> call</c><00:21:26.919><c> of</c><00:21:27.120><c> all</c>

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
I need to call of all
 

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.470 align:start position:0%
I need to call of all
I<00:21:28.919><c> I</c><00:21:29.000><c> think</c><00:21:29.159><c> if</c><00:21:29.279><c> you</c><00:21:29.400><c> just</c><00:21:29.640><c> specify</c><00:21:30.240><c> that</c><00:21:30.360><c> it</c>

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
I I think if you just specify that it
 

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.390 align:start position:0%
I I think if you just specify that it
was<00:21:31.240><c> that</c><00:21:31.440><c> the</c><00:21:32.200><c> members</c><00:21:32.559><c> were</c><00:21:32.840><c> pulled</c><00:21:33.159><c> and</c><00:21:33.279><c> it</c>

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
was that the members were pulled and it
 

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.510 align:start position:0%
was that the members were pulled and it
was<00:21:33.559><c> unanimous</c><00:21:34.120><c> if</c><00:21:34.320><c> that's</c><00:21:34.480><c> helpful</c><00:21:35.279><c> I</c><00:21:35.440><c> I</c>

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
was unanimous if that's helpful I I
 

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.070 align:start position:0%
was unanimous if that's helpful I I
think<00:21:35.640><c> we</c><00:21:35.720><c> need</c><00:21:35.880><c> a</c><00:21:36.080><c> record</c><00:21:36.360><c> of</c><00:21:36.480><c> who</c><00:21:36.640><c> is</c><00:21:36.840><c> here</c>

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
think we need a record of who is here
 

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.149 align:start position:0%
think we need a record of who is here
because<00:21:37.360><c> representative</c><00:21:38.000><c> TZ</c><00:21:38.440><c> is</c><00:21:38.559><c> not</c><00:21:38.919><c> sure</c>

00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
because representative TZ is not sure
 

00:21:39.159 --> 00:21:40.909 align:start position:0%
