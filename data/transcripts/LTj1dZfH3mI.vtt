00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay and uh i'll try again
 
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
to uh maybe to text him so
 
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll go through the documents
 
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
that i sent out last night and for
 
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
anybody uh
 
00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:15.759 align:start position:0%
public watching we do have these uh four
 
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
documents posted on
 
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
the division two webpage at this time um
 
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna let andrea share her screen
 
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh and we've we'll probably start with
 
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
the budget tracking document to start
 
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we're gonna be able to do a
 
00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
whole lot with it today but i just want
 
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
to at least familiarize everybody with
 
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.150 align:start position:0%
to at least familiarize everybody with
this

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
um as you know just because we're gonna
 
00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
update it moving forward each day this
 
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
week but at least uh show everyone where
 
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
we're starting with monday
 
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
today so
 
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
this here is kind of breaking up
 
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
house bill one for the most part to
 
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
start house built two sections in the
 
00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 align:start position:0%
middle and then down below just for
 
00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
everyone's uh
 
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh understanding i compiled everything
 
00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
that we've done to this point
 
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
so this is what i was referring to at
 
00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
the end of
 
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
last week as far as trying to gather
 
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
everybody's proposed
 
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
amendments to funding areas house bill
 
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.789 align:start position:0%
amendments to funding areas house bill
102

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
102
 
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
just to kind of put a tracking sheet
 
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
together for the division so we can work
 
00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 align:start position:0%
off of each day
 
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
so i'll run through them very quickly uh
 
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
um is going to want to discuss
 
00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
a an amendment adding some positions to
 
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
the department of safety
 
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
the next one down is we had talked about
 
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
as a committee to reduce winter
 
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.109 align:start position:0%
as a committee to reduce winter
maintenance

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
and this would be the amount needed in
 
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
dot's budget to balance the highway fund
 
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
the next set um kind of go together
 
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
those three
 
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
lines for doe relative to school
 
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
building we had that discussion with the
 
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
department this morning as far as
 
00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
how much um the top three projects get
 
00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 align:start position:0%
and i broke it out just so you can see
 
00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
you know which which direction the
 
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
committee goes if any
 
00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
we also talked about fully funding
 
00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
special education aid
 
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
these amounts here represent the current
 
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
law three and a half percent
 
00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
is when it kicks in for the cost of a
 
00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
student with a
 
00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 align:start position:0%
an estimate i worked with the department
 
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
to uh project out what those costs may
 
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.910 align:start position:0%
to uh project out what those costs may
be

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
so adding about five and a half million
 
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
over the biennium to that line
 
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
should fully fund the cad aid or
 
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
formerly known a cad a program at doe
 
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
and then the next house bill one these
 
00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
are just nikki mickey hold on just a
 
00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.270 align:start position:0%
are just nikki mickey hold on just a
second

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
is that just for three and a half or is
 
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.550 align:start position:0%
is that just for three and a half or is
that

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
for this is just three and a half so
 
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
this is the current
 
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
law program so if you wanted to change
 
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
it to two and a half i think the
 
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
department had suggested closer to 10
 
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
 
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
in addition an additional 10 million
 
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.229 align:start position:0%
in addition an additional 10 million
correct

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you
 
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
and then the last straight up house bill
 
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
one uh
 
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
quote amendment we'll call it at this
 
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
point is to flat fund the university
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
system and community college system
 
00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 align:start position:0%
at their um 2011 levels
 
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
i also sent and andrew maybe you could
 
00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 align:start position:0%
switch over to the hb1 amendment packet
 
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry oh yeah
 
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
did you say 2011 or 2021 21 i'm sorry if
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
i said 11 i meant 21. sorry about that
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
so and so this other document that i
 
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
sent you the hb1
 
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
amendment packet this is just the detail
 
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
behind some of those lines
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
so for instance that first line that we
 
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
had on that summary page there have the
 
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
the 3d department of safety positions
 
00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
lab positions
 
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
this is the detail behind it this is
 
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
what you'd see actually entered in the
 
00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
budget in the personnel
 
00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
salary line they've got positions in
 
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
three different areas if you recall when
 
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
we went through the department of
 
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
safety's budget
 
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
so if you want to stay high level that
 
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
first document
 
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
we'll have that if you want the real
 
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
detail behind some of these changes i
 
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
did send
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
a house bill one amendment packet as
 
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
well so it's kind of two documents that
 
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
work um
 
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
that you know one's the more detailed
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
version of the same stuff
 
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
andrea if you want to scroll down this
 
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
one you can see kind of what i'm talking
 
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
about you'll see the winter maintenance
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is the next one
 
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
and then further you'll see like the
 
00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
usnh and ccsnh
 
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 align:start position:0%
so this is when we get into the details
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
and you start voting on some changes as
 
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
we move forward
 
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
we'll probably be working off of these
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
more detailed sheets
 
00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
just so it's clear what the action is
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
made by the division
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
um representative member you can correct
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
me for a moment i don't think the plan
 
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
is to do anything with house bill one
 
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.310 align:start position:0%
is to do anything with house bill one
today

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay so this is really
 
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
just in
 
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
informational for everyone today i'll
 
00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
update these sheets again tonight
 
00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow's work session then again
 
00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
tuesday night for wednesday so
 
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
if there's things you want added if
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's things you decide you want to
 
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.990 align:start position:0%
there's things you decide you want to
withdraw

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
and you know something that you've put
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
on here just let me know and i'll update
 
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
these sheets
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
so we can stay focused with our work as
 
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
we progress through the week
 
00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
so back to the budget tracking document
 
00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.950 align:start position:0%
so back to the budget tracking document

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you now there's also going to be
 
00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 align:start position:0%
some spending impacts
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
related to some house bill 2 amendments
 
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
and we'll get to the house bill 2
 
00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.029 align:start position:0%
and we'll get to the house bill 2

tracking document here shortly but i'll
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
just go through a couple of them so the
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
first one is the dual and concurrent
 
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.270 align:start position:0%
first one is the dual and concurrent
enrollment

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative heath has an amendment to
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh one and a half million
 
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
dollars per year
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
for that program with ccsnh
 
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
the next uh is relative to the ccsnhusnh
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
unification plan they said that they
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
could use a million and a half dollars
 
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
estimated for some external support and
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
the work
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
that they were going to do for the um
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
you know proposing some legislation
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
relative to that plan
 
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have an amendment for that yet
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's still in drafting we're still
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
kind of working through
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
any amendment relative to those sections
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
the um commission to
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
to recommend an entity to receive police
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
misconduct complaints
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
um current in the governor's budget
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
there was a half a million dollars set
 
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.150 align:start position:0%
there was a half a million dollars set
aside

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
aside
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
for that entity in fiscal 23
 
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
this would be an amendment to
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
essentially reduce that to a hundred
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars division one
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
zeroed out that budget because it was in
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.270 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
services

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
this would provide a 100 000 placeholder
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
so to speak
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
for whatever that commission proposes
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
for the next legislative session to
 
00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.590 align:start position:0%
for the next legislative session to
consider

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
on line 11 representative heath has an
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
provide funding for the irc unhd
 
00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:36.790 align:start position:0%
provide funding for the irc unhd
innovation

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
innovation
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
research center this is the funding
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
level and the current budget 275 a year
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
we may need to true something up here or
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
slightly edit it because i believe
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
division one did put
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars in there for the
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
biennium so
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
um we'll confirm with representative
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
heath uh what her
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
if she wants to do 275 per year in
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
addition to whatever division one does
 
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
or just make sure between the divisions
 
00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.430 align:start position:0%
or just make sure between the divisions
we

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
set the amount that she'd like uh and
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
then the last house bill 2 impact that i
 
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.469 align:start position:0%
then the last house bill 2 impact that i
have

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
is mickey before you go on uh
 
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
where is that uh funding in the budget
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
is that in uh division one it is it's
 
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's a line item in division one's
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
budget so this would be somewhat
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
crossing over divisions to do this so
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
division one has
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
made their recommendation on how much to
 
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
fund the irc
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
um it's up to representative heath if
 
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
she wants to move forward with this or
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
just rely
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
on that recommendation that but that's
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
something we can discuss when
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps when she's with us uh for the
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
next work session
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
yeah my my concern on that i'm not
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to this
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
amendment but my concern is that um
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think that we should do anything
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
that affects another division's budget
 
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:51.470 align:start position:0%
that's my um
 
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.869 align:start position:0%
that's my um
[Music]

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's my take on it so anyhow
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it at that it relates to
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
the university system but you're right
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
in that it
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
it flows through the department of uh
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
business and economic affairs budget
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
which is a division one
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
in the last amendment here and this is
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
still in drafting
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh relative to the public school
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund um
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment to reduce that from
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
30 million over the biennium down to
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
essentially one million a half a million
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
which would free up 29 million dollars
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
of education
 
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
trust fund i should have etf on there
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
and i'll update that
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
um for tomorrow's sheet that's not a
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
general fund situation
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh down below is just a summary of items
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
we've already approved most of it was
 
00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.630 align:start position:0%
we've already approved most of it was
the

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's no general funds here no
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
education trust funds
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
these were the kind of those uh budget
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
technical defect
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
type amendments that agencies asked for
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
that we've approved to pass work
 
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.230 align:start position:0%
that we've approved to pass work
sessions

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
and i've put a total down at the bottom
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i'll track this daily just so
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
the division knows what we've done to uh
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
each day
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
so i don't have anything more to add on
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
these two documents that we just covered
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to familiarize everyone
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
with them so if you have questions or
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
or anything moving forward hopefully we
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
understand kind of what i'm trying to
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
put here for
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
let me uh let me just make some a couple
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
the reduction in the public school
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
um i don't know whether the 500 000 is
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
the right number
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh this morning they were talking about
 
00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:37.910 align:start position:0%
uh this morning they were talking about
um

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
needing about a million dollars in there
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
so you know that
 
00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959 align:start position:0%
that number is uh is pretty fluid
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
but what i was looking at
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
um using this money
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
to fund things like dual and
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment the uh
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
money for the um uh support for the
 
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.550 align:start position:0%
money for the um uh support for the
study

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
the money for no no not that
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
um addition additional money
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
for um
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
boy my my mind is crazy uh
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
if we decide that we want to uh
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
reduce the uh the tail
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know that would that would come out
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
29 million and um
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's basically all things that
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
deal with uh like you know the
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
increase for um a special ed
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh all of those kinds of things
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
because i i think that
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
we have some other shortfalls in the
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
that are probably
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say from my perspective
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
more important than funding
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
this uh the public school infrastructure
 
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:13.750 align:start position:0%
this uh the public school infrastructure
fund

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's just my take on it so um
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
i wanted to let you know why that
 
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.190 align:start position:0%
i wanted to let you know why that
amendment

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
um went in that we're not you know i'm
 
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.430 align:start position:0%
um went in that we're not you know i'm
not

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
belittling i guess the uh public school
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
people but i do think that there are
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
better uses of that money overall so
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
marjorie i see you have a question i
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
just i just wanted to also
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
just interject here that some of that
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
federal money can indeed be used for
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
these projects that
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
people have on the list so that would
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
seem like a wise
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
decision to me
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh joe you have a question
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair uh could you
 
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.470 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair uh could you
uh

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
what was the original intent of this
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
fund

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm working on two computers and trying
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
to think at the same time
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
the original purpose of this when it was
 
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.750 align:start position:0%
the original purpose of this when it was
formed

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
formed
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
was to provide internet connectivity
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
money for the schools and this occurred
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
um i want to say it was
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
after the florida school incident
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
where there were several children killed
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
and what the governor wanted to do
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
was to um provide money to
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
the schools to improve security
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
and i think that um caitlin said this
 
00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.710 align:start position:0%
and i think that um caitlin said this
morning

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
that we had was it 20 million mickey
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh at some point you mean
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah closer to 30 over the
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
yeah and they said this morning that all
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
of that money had been spent
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
or obligated i guess is the right term
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
so they did in fact use it for the
 
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.230 align:start position:0%
so they did in fact use it for the
purpose

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
that it was um allocated
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
and um i sat on that committee
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
for two years i guess maybe
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know some some amount of time
 
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.230 align:start position:0%
i don't know some some amount of time
and

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
um we were very careful in how we
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh allocated it and made sure
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
that it went to the projects that the
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
um that were
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
set in law so
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
any does it does anyone have any other
 
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:08.949 align:start position:0%
any does it does anyone have any other
questions

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any so if we could go
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
on mickey
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
sure so um that house bill 2 section
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
that we just went through with all those
 
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.710 align:start position:0%
that we just went through with all those
amendments

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
so if we go to the house bill 2 tracking
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
sheet now
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
um those will also be on here so
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit you know it's that's
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
kind of the nature of house bill 2
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
is we have to change house bill 2 but we
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
also have to reflect any
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
budgetary impacts you know to the bottom
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
line we carry it on the surplus
 
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.990 align:start position:0%
line we carry it on the surplus
statement

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
um so anyways you you should remember
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
this document or something similar to it
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
i've updated it with the decisions that
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
we've made to this point so some of the
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
sections in house bill 2 assigned to us
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
we've already taken care of so if we
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
jump down to
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 page 22 section 44 we
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
accepted that
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
as it's in the governor's recommended
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
budget no change
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
the next section would be relative to
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
education funding i think at that point
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
that this is probably on hold
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we have no amendments
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
relative to these sections
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh for the division's consideration
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
from the conversation this morning i
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
think there's still some uh
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
discussions to be had on education
 
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.389 align:start position:0%
discussions to be had on education
funding

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
um oh yes along along along with
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
representatives lin's
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh nuclear attack that he provided
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's very true uh the
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
the next section is kind of that
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
technical section relative to the
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement funds and if you
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
recall we amended it to
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
open up the uses of the education trust
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
fund to line up with what we're actually
 
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.590 align:start position:0%
fund to line up with what we're actually
spending

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
spending
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
in the budget so we adopted amendment
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
zero six nine three h at a previous um
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
work session uh public school
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure would be the next set of
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
sections in um
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. there is an amendment
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's relative that includes that 14
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollar reduction per
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
year that we just discussed
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
um that amendment as of the time that i
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
put this together
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
was still in drafting i have received it
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
from os and i just needed to review it
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
so when i
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
update this for tomorrow and send
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
everyone their documents um
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
we'll have an amendment for for those
 
00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:27.030 align:start position:0%
we'll have an amendment for for those
sections

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
the crisis intervention team training
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
and the the
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
bears we'll call just the bears sections
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
we dealt with those um
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
at a previous work session
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
the next uh set of sections is relative
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
to ccs and h and usnh
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
um there is an amendment in drafting
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
that represent turcotte's been working
 
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.629 align:start position:0%
that represent turcotte's been working
on

00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
we do not have that but we will have
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
that for tomorrow we
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
so i believe the plan is to have a work
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
session relative to those sections
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh tomorrow at 10. uh correct me if i'm
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
wrong representative omburger
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
no that's correct okay um
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
the next section page 61 section 133 so
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment for this and i
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
think this is one that we could probably
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
deal with today if the division wanted
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
to so if you recall
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
um this is um relative to the department
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
of transportation's ability to
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
seek reimbursement or liability for
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
damage done to highway or fixtures or
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
um you know roadways
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
so one thing that the judiciary
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
committee had concerns with
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
was that in house bill 2 there's a
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
section that allows for this
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
law to be applied retrospectively
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
so if you go to the house bill 2
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
amendments andrea
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative umberger has an
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
amendment here zero nine zero eight nine

section is on page 61 of your house bill
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
twos and i believe everyone

i know we've got uh representative
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
ellison and uh
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
well i think representative allison's
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
our new sub for today
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
um i think i sent you a house bill 2
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
link so i hope you're able to
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
understand where we are with this do you
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
have any questions representative i i
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't thank you very much
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
okay so the next section is uh sections
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
135 and 136
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
and this was relative to federally
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
funded um real estate that dot sells
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
just making it clear where the the
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
disposition of revenue relative to those
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
parcels goes
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
um i believe the uh public works and
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
highways committee chimed in on this and
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
was good with it
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
and there's no house bill one impact to
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
this so
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
i think the committee could move on with
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
this if there's no other
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
concerns is there anyone that has a
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a motion please
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
what was the amendment number again uh
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's actually no amendment number for
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
this one we'll just be accepting it as
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
it is in house bill 2.
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i'm sorry do you have a
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
like a shorthand title for how i should
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
raise this acceptance
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
i think this is acceptance of disposal
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
of federal funds
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
it could just be accept section 135 and
 
00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:52.070 align:start position:0%
it could just be accept section 135 and
136.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
136.
 
00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:53.430 align:start position:0%
oh okay great
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.909 align:start position:0%

okay thank you um mickey the next one
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh okay similarly uh sections 137 to 139
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh do not have a direct state fund
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
impact in the budget
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
uh and these sections were also cleared
 
00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:08.070 align:start position:0%
uh and these sections were also cleared
with

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
the chair of the transportation
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee i believe and they
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed it and did not have any
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
concerns with with these clarifications
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
is there anyone that has a problem
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative porter go ahead i don't
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
have a problem i'm just curious
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
why this wasn't um done in a
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is there any
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
rationale for that if it's just
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
definitions yeah i i think that what
 
00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:45.830 align:start position:0%
definitions yeah i i think that what
happened

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
is that um d.o.t gave this to the
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
governor as something that needed to be
 
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.630 align:start position:0%
governor as something that needed to be
updated

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
updated
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
and um and so he did
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
but um it
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
it is you know i can't answer why there
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't any legislation on it
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there are things that uh
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
fall into hb2 that have not gone through
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
the um you know things like this so
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's all i can say i don't know
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes too representative it's a
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
timing thing so
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
legislative filing may pass but the
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget doesn't come out
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
till the second week of
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh february so sometimes agencies will
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
seek to see if the governor will support
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
putting something
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
into the trailer bill it's just that i
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
remember seem to be remembering
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
long debates on the floor having to do
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
with unmanned
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
spacecraft or aircraft before and i was
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
i think all this is is just a
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
a definition update
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
that that would affect you know like
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
i know we've had discussions on the
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
floor about unmanned aircraft spying on
 
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.110 align:start position:0%

all right it's a vote of seven to zero
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay mickey if you would continue please
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
sure the next sections
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
are uh sections 140 and 141
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
which are relative to a an appropriation
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
a general fund appropriation from a few
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
years back
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
that still has remaining unspent dollars
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
that the governor's budget
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
recommended uh lapsing those dollars
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund as a way of
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
helping balance the highway fund budget
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
for the next two years
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
so this is 8.1 million dollars
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
that is essentially treated as addition
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
or income to the highway fund as
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
we're balancing it for the next two
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
years so without this section
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
you'd essentially create an 8.1 million
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
is there anyone that has a problem
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none where
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%

okay we can all
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%

of safety's authorized transfers
 
00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:49.830 align:start position:0%
of safety's authorized transfers
currently

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
under the current budget and in house
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
bill 2 is recommended out of the
 
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.750 align:start position:0%
bill 2 is recommended out of the
governor

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
it allows the department with the
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
budget office approval
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
to move some money within some class
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
lines that are otherwise restricted by
 
00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:03.510 align:start position:0%
lines that are otherwise restricted by
law

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's no budget impact to that it just
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
provides the department some flexibility
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
and moving money around
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
this amendment adds on to this and if
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
you recall there was a discussion when
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
we had the department with us
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
to grant them authority for the biennium
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
only to move money around
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
to fill positions that are currently
 
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.070 align:start position:0%
to fill positions that are currently
unfunded

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
so for instance if they have a funded
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
because position and
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
budgets excuse me positions in the
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
budget have money tied to them
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
so for instance if they have a program
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
specialist two that's funded
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
and a program specialist four that's not
 
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.830 align:start position:0%
and a program specialist four that's not
funded

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
they could move money between those
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
positions and fill the one that they
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
would like to hire for
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
there's at least two other agencies that
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
have this authority
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2 now i believe oi
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
department of information technology and
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
corrections if i'm not mistaken so this
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
was something that the department had
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
asked for thank you andrea
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
and there's really no direct budget
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
impact to this it just provides
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
okay uh this is the
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
the amendments to hb2 it's the second
 
00:30:19.279 --> 00:30:21.590 align:start position:0%

entanglement between the dashboard
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
camera fund and the commission to
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
provide recommendations to study an
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
entity relative to law enforcement
 
00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.710 align:start position:0%
entity relative to law enforcement
misconduct

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
so we're going to carve these two
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
programs out separately into two
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
different amendments
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
the first is uh zero nine two one provo
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
proposed by representative heath
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
that essentially
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
does what the underlying house bill 2
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
does however it does allow for the
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
to fund a position from this
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
million-dollar appropriation for the
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
dashboard camera fund
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
so if you look on lines 14 through 16
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
you see where that it provides
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
permission for the department to utilize
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
the fund
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
to pay for a business administrator
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
position which the department had
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
nikki do you know if this is the lesser
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
of the two
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
cost because safety did tell us they
 
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:12.630 align:start position:0%
cost because safety did tell us they
could

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
use a lower cost
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know that answer i can
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
check in with steve
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
um at the department if you'd like but
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
this when i asked him for the details of
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
the position they want this is
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
what he had given me uh was the business
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
administrator one position okay well i
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
guess they can make a different decision
 
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.909 align:start position:0%
guess they can make a different decision
right

00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
um the way it's written now
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
i mean that the the bill this amendment
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
is pretty specific to a
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
business administrator one position but
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
it's their
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's the one they selected so if they
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to change their mind later and do
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
a lesser position or a greater position
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
as far as labor grade
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to without
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
reclassifying that position through
 
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.830 align:start position:0%
reclassifying that position through
personnel

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think we better check on that
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
before we
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh proceed to a vote just to make sure
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
that we've got the right
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
the right position i actually have steve
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
in the attendees now i could oh okay
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
yeah put him right on the spot and pull
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
him right in
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
mr lavoy are you there i am here
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
okay yes mickey has a question for you
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
steve the business administrator one
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
position is this uh
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
can you provide us some context of this
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
versus any other
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
option for personnel to administer this
 
00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:02.710 align:start position:0%
option for personnel to administer this
program

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes so we had we were originally
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
requesting a program specialist three
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
position which is a higher labor grade
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
um went back and and talked with our
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
grants team
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
and um we were able to reduce that
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
position down to a business
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
administrator one uh which is a
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
lower labor grade that's a labor grade
 
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.069 align:start position:0%
lower labor grade that's a labor grade
21

00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
um and so uh there there is some cost
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
savings by going with this
 
00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:29.990 align:start position:0%
savings by going with this
classification

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
classification
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the original that we had
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
mickey this authorizes this position to
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
come out of the
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
um the money that we've allocated
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
is and then the rest of it just um
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
straightens out and takes out all that
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
other stuff
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
and we'll have a different amendment to
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
add that back
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
correct this this amendment here is just
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
specific to the dashboard camera fund
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
the body cam
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.470 align:start position:0%
fund and the the other commission on the

00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
police misconduct will handle in a
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
the next amendment is uh
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
0922h which is relative to the
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%

misconduct complaints so on um
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's on page five of the amendment
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
packet starting with section 148 and
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
this is where when we string house bill
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
2 these sections will still be near each
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
other but
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
they will be separate and distinct so
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
the only changes here between
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
what was proposed by the governor and
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
this and the amendment is
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
if you go down to lines uh 15 through 17
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
the director of the police standards and
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
training council and the commissioner of
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
safety or their designees
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
would be appointed to this commission
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
and that was something that was
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
discussed in division
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
and that's what this rec this amendment
 
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.750 align:start position:0%
and that's what this rec this amendment
does

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
and then continuing down
 
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
um scroll down for me andrew thank you
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
there is an appropriation here of 100
 
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.150 align:start position:0%
there is an appropriation here of 100
000

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal year 23 to essentially be
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
a set aside
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
to provide funding for whatever the
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
entity is that this commission comes up
 
00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:43.990 align:start position:0%
entity is that this commission comes up
with

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
in the governor's recommended budget
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
there was um
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
over half a million dollars set aside
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
for this purpose in the administrative
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
services budget
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
division one will be taking all that
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
money away just blowing blowing that
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
budget away
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment here would put 100 000
 
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.750 align:start position:0%
this amendment here would put 100 000
aside

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
aside
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh for this entity uh if you scroll down
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
section 150 on line five there there is
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
a contingency
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
with that appropriation so in the event
 
00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.670 align:start position:0%
with that appropriation so in the event
that

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
this commission you know the work that
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
the commission recommends
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
puts in a bill next session if an entity
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
is never established for whatever reason
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh this appropriation of a hundred
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars essentially just stays
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
in the general fund
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be made if there was no
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
purpose for doing so so
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
um other than that that's that's all the
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
is there anyone that has a problem
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative lynn you know what the
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
only i don't really have a problem with
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
voting on it the only question i had is
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't um didn't we when we had the
 
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.230 align:start position:0%
wasn't um didn't we when we had the
discussion

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
um wasn't there wasn't there some
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
question about
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
um should we change the provision the
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
provision that talks about the four
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
other members um doesn't
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
it doesn't provide how they get
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
appointed and i thought we
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
that there was some discussion about uh
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
wanting to change
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
that to say how those four people get
 
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.630 align:start position:0%
that to say how those four people get
appointed

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
i think it's up it's up in the earlier
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
part um line 18
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes right yeah so so this
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment doesn't change that so
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's still
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
i guess subject to interpretation and
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
probably assume that it would be the
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
leact commission itself who who
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
determines the members that would sit on
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
this commission
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
um i mean if
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
if the committee wanted to work on this
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
and do something different i can
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
amend i can change this and come back
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
with a different amendment or
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's really up to the division you
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
know i just raised the i mean it's not
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's certainly not a deal breaker
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
from my perspective but i just wanted to
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
raise the issue if anybody else thinks
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's necessary because
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
um this is a outgrowth
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
of the leak committee and
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
i am sure that this group will report
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
back to the leak committee uh before any
 
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.510 align:start position:0%
back to the leak committee uh before any
legislation

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
is uh submitted so
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
i think i don't i don't really think
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's necessary
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone have a problem with
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will uh ask
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
for abortion to approve amendment
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%

section

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
that i think we can consider just
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
accepting as it is in house bill 2.
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
so this was section 149 on page 65
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
relative to establishing the
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.349 align:start position:0%
uh radio infrastructure procurement
standards

00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
with department of safety and with admin
 
00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:16.950 align:start position:0%
with department of safety and with admin
services

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh we heard from the department as to
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
the necessity of this and there's no
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
real uh you know line to point to in the
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
budget that
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
that's relative to this section um
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
and there's no amendment so it's an up
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
or down at this point
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
are there um is there anyone
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
that has a problem if we vote on this
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a motion to
 
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.390 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a motion to
accept

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
accept
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
the department of safety
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
radio infrastructure equipment purchases

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
i guess we didn't need that we just
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
needed to say accept excuse me
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative lynn votes yes
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative hamburger votes yes all
 
00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:48.710 align:start position:0%
representative hamburger votes yes all
right

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
okay um the state
 
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship program we decided to
 
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
eliminate that right mickey
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
correct so we do have an amendment
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
amendment 0
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
9 0 7 h which
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
um essentially eliminates all of those
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
changes to the state
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
but adds one new provision
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
and does a little bit of statutory
 
00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.430 align:start position:0%
and does a little bit of statutory
housekeeping

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
so the new provision here andrea's
 
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.349 align:start position:0%
so the new provision here andrea's
highlighted

00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
highlighted
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
basically would allow for the college
 
00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:36.790 align:start position:0%
basically would allow for the college
tuition

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
savings plan advisory commission who
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
currently oversees
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
the higher education endowment trust
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
fund the unique dollars as well as the
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
governor's scholarship program
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
this would allow them to decide if they
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
feel they would like to transfer money
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
between those two funds for the per
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
for the programs they administer there'd
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
be no
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
legislative required approval with this
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
it would essentially just allow
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
that commission to manage the funds
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
between the dollars between those two
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
funds as they see fit
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
the next provision and it's really the
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
remainder of the bill
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
it was kind of observed that the
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
governor's scholarship program
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
and the fund still resided in the
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
so um this um
 
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.069 align:start position:0%
so um this um
[Music]

00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment here just lifts the
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
entire program right from that chapter
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
and puts it
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
over with the uh the higher education
 
00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.829 align:start position:0%
over with the uh the higher education
scholarship

00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
section of law so everything after here
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
there are no changes it is literally a
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
cut and paste
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
just to reorganize the statute a little
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
in line with the current administration
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative porter thank you
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair mickey can you just
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
repeat what you just said about this
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
last section it just
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
moves it from what to what so currently
 
00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:07.510 align:start position:0%
moves it from what to what so currently
it's

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's scholarship for and when
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
it was established it was under the
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
governor's office's
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
office of strategic initiatives okay
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
last budget
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
it was moved to be under the
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
administration of the higher education
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship commission
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
but it never got moved in rsa this
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
amendment just
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
moves it out of rsa to kind of a more
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate place
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
as far as who's truly administering that
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
program so it is a
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
you know statutory housekeeping so to
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
speak thank you
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
and can i have one more question madam
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
chair certainly we can have all the
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
questions we need
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
okay um i know there was some concern
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
the other day and we talked about this
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
of the possibility of one fund draining
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
completely another fund if this was
 
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.349 align:start position:0%
completely another fund if this was
allowed

00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
but i think we settled that with that it
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't happen but i would like once
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
again to just be assured
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
that by doing this change we're not
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
going to have the
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
unique funds all end up in the
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
governor's funds or vice versa
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
this this amendment would authorize all
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
those decisions to be made by the
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
higher education endowment uh
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
scholarship advisory commission i
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
probably just butchered the name of it
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
but there it would be up to them to
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
decide how much money for each program
 
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:28.630 align:start position:0%
decide how much money for each program
so

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
um if they voted to do what you're
 
00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:32.630 align:start position:0%
um if they voted to do what you're
suggesting

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
this would be this would give them the
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
permission to do so i guess so
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's nothing limiting that from
 
00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:45.750 align:start position:0%
there's nothing limiting that from
happening

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um is i guess you know
 
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
that was a big concern of mine
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh that that you know one gets dumped
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
into the other um
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what that would mean and
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
is there you know should we consider a
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
way to prevent that from happening
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
and my other question is what are the
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
sections that get eliminated i think it
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
starts on page
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
or it's on page 70 it's 162
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
until where what's the end for that part
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
these sections 160 through 168 that get
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
overwritten by the amendment
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
that's it 162 to 168 160
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
oh the whole thing yeah yeah gets
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
replaced by
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment the amendment okay thank
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
you and can you speak to uh you know
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
i worry about you know something
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
nefarious about taking all the money
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
from one to the other
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'll defer to representative umberger to
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
speak more on this idea but i
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
think it's in the uh context of at this
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
time division one has recommended
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
not appropriating any additional funds
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
for the governor's scholarship program
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
and this amendment would at least give
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility to that
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
commission should they want to allocate
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
any of their current funding source to
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
the other program
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
but i'll defer to representative
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
umberger to speak further
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
nope that's that's exactly right mickey
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
and there is currently money in the
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
governor's scholarship program
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
that has not been spent and
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
um i mean if
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know i i personally trust this
 
00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:19.990 align:start position:0%
you know i i personally trust this
commission

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing and to make sure
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
the money is dispersed because even
 
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.630 align:start position:0%
the money is dispersed because even
though

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
though
um

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:27.090 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:30.549 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
both both scholarship things are really
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
they're not there's not a big difference
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
between what
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
unique does and what the governor's
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship does it was
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
primarily the the governor wanted at the
 
00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:49.349 align:start position:0%
primarily the the governor wanted at the
time

00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
to show that he cared about the cost of
 
00:50:52.839 --> 00:50:54.069 align:start position:0%
to show that he cared about the cost of
education

00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
so that's my that's my take on it
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative lynn yes
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
just the only question i had uh madam
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
chairs am i understanding correctly
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
mickey that this change that we're
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
talking about voting on now
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
does does not have anything doesn't i
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
well i shouldn't say it doesn't have
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
anything to do with
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
but this does not we're not a by
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
approving this
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
we're not approving the the uh
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
proposal to uh for the loan forgiveness
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
is that correct yeah what this is what
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment is effectively doing is
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
eliminating that proposal
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
so this is this is overwriting
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
everything the governor recommended in
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
these sections
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
with only what you see in this amendment
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
so it's effectively a
 
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
a delete and an ad but just kind of done
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
in one action
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
so that's the student loan debt relief
 
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.230 align:start position:0%
so that's the student loan debt relief
program

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
administered with the bfa that would be
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation from division two with
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh let me just respond to represent lynn
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
a second
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
what is that called sllr is that the
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
the program where they're giving money
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
to nurses
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
the student loan repayment yeah student
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
loan repayment program or something it's
 
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:20.710 align:start position:0%
loan repayment program or something it's
called

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
yeah uh and there's as i understand it
 
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
there's still money in there
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
and so that would continue
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
that workforce initiative would continue
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh this doesn't do anything to change
 
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.069 align:start position:0%
uh this doesn't do anything to change
that

00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
but this just says that we're not going
 
00:52:40.559 --> 00:52:41.109 align:start position:0%
but this just says that we're not going
to

00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
and i guess there's probably money left
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
the dollars that were initially put out
 
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:49.670 align:start position:0%
the dollars that were initially put out
for

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
um regenerative
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
whatever regenerative uh stuff
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so so the proposal to direct some
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the unique
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
dollars to that program all that would
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
come out that would not be
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
that would be replaced with this
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
amendment but from a previous program
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
i understand there's also some dollars
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with with that other
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
program enough to know i think that's
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
something that's
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
tied to division three and i think it's
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
something they look at but
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
well i think it was in division one
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
there may be one okay
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
okay um because it
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know which anyhow
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative porter
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i i admit that
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
i don't understand completely how this
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
is at 729 is that the number that you
 
00:53:49.119 --> 00:53:49.670 align:start position:0%
is at 729 is that the number that you
use

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
to discuss this but there's an endowment
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
and then there's money for scholarships
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
so this wouldn't change anything to have
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
having to do with the endowment just the
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
money for scholarships
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
that in that portion of the unique
 
00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:03.910 align:start position:0%
that in that portion of the unique
scholarship

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
program is that right the higher
 
00:54:07.119 --> 00:54:07.990 align:start position:0%
program is that right the higher
education

00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
commission or whatever they're called uh
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
voted last year
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
to change the percentage that goes to
 
00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.390 align:start position:0%
to change the percentage that goes to
scholarships

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the percentage that goes to
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
endowment right it used to be
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
80 20 endowment to scholarships
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
now it is 70 to scholarships
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murray
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you we can go back to slurp for a
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
minute um
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
where is that program and is that
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
program still funded
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
all i know is it still has money but
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
where it is i have no clue
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
where does the money come from i believe
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh put money in the program when
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh when we were you know i mean not that
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's changed any
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
but we're having a lot of trouble with
 
00:55:03.599 --> 00:55:05.270 align:start position:0%
but we're having a lot of trouble with
uh

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
hiring nurses and so this was sort of
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
like an incentive
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
but where is it i have no clue yeah
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
so do we want to vote on this or
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
represent lynn did you have a another
 
00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:33.349 align:start position:0%
represent lynn did you have a another
comment

00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
um you know i i guess i'm i mean i
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
if the consensus is to vote on this i
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
can i can vote on it
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
um and probably support it i'm uh
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
i i i guess i'm not i'm not completely
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
sure that i'm
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
although i although i think that that
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know doing what we're doing here is
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
probably the right thing um
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not completely sure that that uh
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
you know the what the governor proposed
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
there with the student loan forgiveness
 
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.230 align:start position:0%
there with the student loan forgiveness
is

00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
is a bad idea um but if every
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
i guess what i would say is i'm not so
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
committed to the other to the position
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
that it is uh
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh that it is a good idea that if
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
everybody else on this
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh committee thinks that we should vote
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
what the what the amendment proposes i'm
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
i'm so moved oh thank you
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
i'll second
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
senator lynn would you call the role
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%

representative umberger representative
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
umberger votes yes
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
the vote of seven to zero in the firm
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
and let me let me just say that if um
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know the senate feels strongly about
 
00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.309 align:start position:0%
you know the senate feels strongly about
uh

00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
paying off student loans they can
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
put something back in so that's
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're not the last bite
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
of the apple so to speak
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
okay um let's go on mickey we're making
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
some progress here
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
sure so the next amendment now we're
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
getting into new sections so these would
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
not be amendments that replace anything
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2. those would just be
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
brand new sections to the bill
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
the first one is amendment 0852h
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
proposed by representative umberger that
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
would essentially lift administration of
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
the dual and concurrent enrollment
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
program from the department of education
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
and just put everything with the
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
community college system of new
 
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.030 align:start position:0%
community college system of new
hampshire

00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
so this amendment makes no dollar
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
changes in any way
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
it just rather than the money being
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
appropriated and flowing from
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
doe to ccsnh the program would just be
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
administered entirely by ccsnh
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
we we really haven't discussed this one
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
before so i would
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
ask that you uh take a look at it
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
if you remember um
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
doe had zeroed out this line
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
and uh said that they didn't think they
 
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:12.870 align:start position:0%
and uh said that they didn't think they
should

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
should
um

00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:13.150 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:15.910 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
be the administrator of it we reached
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
out to the community college
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
and they said they had no problem and
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
they provided some
 
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:28.410 align:start position:0%
language for us and um
 
00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:29.670 align:start position:0%
language for us and um
[Music]

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be able to put some
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
money into
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
this program so um
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
but i think we i think we need to uh
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
to think about this a little bit more
 
00:59:44.839 --> 00:59:46.230 align:start position:0%
to think about this a little bit more
than

00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
although i guess mickey we could in fact
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
approve this switch without any money
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
assigned to it correct correct so we
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
have two separate house bill two
 
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.470 align:start position:0%
have two separate house bill two
amendments

00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
right now one that does what we
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
discussed just
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
lifting the administration and then the
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
next amendment from representative heath
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
would appropriate
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
a million and a half dollars a year for
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
this program so they are two separate
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh decisions for the committee
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i think it does
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
make sense to do this if
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
doe doesn't want it um but i
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
we can do this in two separate
 
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
amendments we don't need to have it all
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
in one
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
so if we if we worked on this today we
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
could work on the other one tomorrow
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
senator murray thank you in the second
 
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
senator murray thank you in the second
amendment

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
when it says that you know the 1.5
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
million for funding the dual
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
um does funding include you know money
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
for the students but also for the
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
administration of the program
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh when i when that one came in i don't
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
know if we were clear that it was also
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i mean there's
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in here
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
either prohibiting or allowing for
 
01:01:08.839 --> 01:01:10.150 align:start position:0%
either prohibiting or allowing for
administration

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
i do not believe i'd have to double
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
check i'm not i don't think the
 
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.630 align:start position:0%
check i'm not i don't think the
department

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
cuts any admin i don't actually speak
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure of that so if you want
 
01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:21.990 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure of that so if you want
to

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
craft this appropriation to be specific
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
to allow for
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh administrative costs to be deducted
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
or that it'd be a hundred percent for
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know paying for the courses i
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
think we could maybe
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
um tweak the amendment to do whatever
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
you desire on that
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
it seems they might require some
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
administrative support so they might
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
like that flexibility
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
similar to what we did with department
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
of safety and
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know the administration for the
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
body cam for the municipalities
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
do we want to vote on moving the program
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
from doe
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
to community college today or do we want
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
to wait on that
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
for me i'm okay making the move but i'd
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
like to check with heath
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
about if we need to have language for
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
administration i will
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
offense we won't we won't do this we
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
won't do this one here
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
we'll just do the other one all right
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
don't move madam chair second
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%

yeah so we'll skip over zero eight nine
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
three h and um
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
we can decide whether that amendment
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
should be modified uh for another work
 
01:03:28.079 --> 01:03:29.190 align:start position:0%
should be modified uh for another work
session

01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
so the next amendment would be one that
 
01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.549 align:start position:0%
so the next amendment would be one that
representative

have a hearing
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i i don't feel comfortable um
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
voting on it without some public input
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
as i understand it
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to be picking out
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
the tough ones okay
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
let's i will uh
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
i'll speak to representative wyler and
 
01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:28.549 align:start position:0%
i'll speak to representative wyler and
uh

01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
what's next so the next one we briefly
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
touched on it before the
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative heath's amendment to fund
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
the irc the innovation research center
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
so we probably want to skip that one for
 
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:50.549 align:start position:0%
so we probably want to skip that one for
now

01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
for a day when we get into the you know
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
the money uh
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
decisions i agree the next amendment
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
zero eight four five h
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
we've discussed this at a previous work
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
session relative to the department of
 
01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.349 align:start position:0%
session relative to the department of
transportation

01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
if lapse estimates are met at the end of
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
amounts that they lapse above their
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
portion of the laps they get to keep to
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
buy equipment
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's amendment zero eight four five h
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
to uh hold off on this one please okay
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
the last two amendments that i have for
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
us today are relative to
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
retained bills that we've got in
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
division two
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
the first this is actually going back to
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
the first public hearing we had i think
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
back in february
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
on the charter school lease aid cap
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
currently it's a 30 000
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
per school per year cap i believe this
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
amendment lifts it to
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
50 uh in in accordance with house bill
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
521 that passed the house and was
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
referred to finance
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
this bill does not result in
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
any impact to state spending
 
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
it just allows for
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
the cap to be up to 50 for a
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
reimbursement there's 500 000
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
a year for this program in the budget
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
and it is pro-rated
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
depending on the appropriation available
 
01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
depending on the appropriation available
so

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
in all likelihood 500 000 will be spent
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
program each year if this bill here this
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
amendment rather
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
just kind of reallocates how much can go
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
to each school when the when the
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh do we want to uh do something with
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
this today or would you
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
i guess i would prefer to wait okay no
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
okay um go ahead mickey
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
the last amendment is amendment number
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
zero nine one h eight which is relative
 
01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:07.749 align:start position:0%
zero nine one h eight which is relative
to

01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
a section that's in house bill 594 that
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
we had a work session on i believe last
 
01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:12.709 align:start position:0%
we had a work session on i believe last
week

01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
um relative to school building a this
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't take
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
all of the bill and put it into house
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill 2. to
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
it carves out the 10-year plan that was
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
discussed if you recall
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
so rather than that portion you know
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
staying in the retain bill to be worked
 
01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:29.269 align:start position:0%
staying in the retain bill to be worked
on

01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
later this would at least move this
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
policy of the house forward
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
if you recall this bill has already gone
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
to education
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
and passed the full house and was
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
anyone have any thoughts on this
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
so there's not a money amount tied to
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
this this is just
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
um basically including the policy that
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
came out of education
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
correct yeah this bill also had the
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
changing the 50 million dollar cap on
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
school building aid to a floor
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
that would have had a cost to it this
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
section is just the non-direct budget
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
impact for
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
the development of the 10-year plan for
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
school building aid projects
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
other comments is there anyone that has
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative ellison i i don't have
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
a problem at all but i i would just
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
reinforce that it went through education
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
and there was no uh there are no issues
 
01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.590 align:start position:0%
and there was no uh there are no issues
there

01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
and we need a we need a 10-year plan for
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
okay i obviously i don't disagree with
 
01:10:53.199 --> 01:10:54.149 align:start position:0%
okay i obviously i don't disagree with
that

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
so could i have a motion

01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay and i guess that's substituting
 
01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:23.270 align:start position:0%
okay and i guess that's substituting
again

01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
for um or for representative porter we
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
