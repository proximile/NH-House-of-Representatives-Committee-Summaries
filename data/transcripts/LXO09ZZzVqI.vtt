00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
so that's okay we'll we'll do okay today
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
and just you know folks we're doing the
 
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
best we can we have limited data we've
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time and effort as you
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
know trying to get our head around these
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
numbers uh but the best numbers
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we could get are in March and April
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
and we don't have those so we're going
 
00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
to do the best we can with what we have
 
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
and we'll at least come up with
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
something today that we can at least
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
move forward but we can always come back
 
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
and revisit these numbers as we continue
 
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
to watch the trends so we have about
 
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
five or six remaining categories that we
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
haven't taken straw votes on yet we will
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
do those this morning
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
once we get to a nice place that we can
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
all agree we will then take a lunch
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
break and crochet in the legislative
 
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
budget office will put those numbers
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
into a spreadsheet that we can look back
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
together at and really make sure it's
 
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.490 align:start position:0%
together at and really make sure it's
accurate

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
and assume it will be and then we will
 
00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:49.019 align:start position:0%
take our full final vote on that but
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing straw votes throughout
 
00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:53.459 align:start position:0%
and having discussions throughout so
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit different from a
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
regular Bill hearing where we're not
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
hearing from anyone from the outside
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
anymore we do have a very expert person
 
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
with us the commissioner of the dra who
 
00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
can help us with the numbers because
 
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
today we are dealing with some of the
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
bigger numbers and and her office is the
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
one that knows the most about those okay
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
awesome so we have uh like I said
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
several different categories I thought
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
it might be nice if we start with
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
something relatively simple
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh which would maybe be the utility
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh which if you look at your worksheet
 
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:35.540 align:start position:0%
is column o
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
chair Sanborn yes do you want to just
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
explain the worksheet to the new members
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
so they understand what they have
 
00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:43.259 align:start position:0%
absolutely do they all have does anyone
 
00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
have a copy of this worksheet now
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
okay so uh this worksheet uh has
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
different columns with different
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
categories of revenues and you'll see
 
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
there's a letter at the top and so we're
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
going to page six column o which is the
 
00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
utility property tax
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
and we are working on
 
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
straw votes basically for three
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
different numbers what we expect
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
revenues to be for the remainder and the
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
total of fiscal year 2023 which ends
 
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
June 30th fiscal year 2024 and fiscal
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
year 2025.
 
00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:24.419 align:start position:0%
and generally women we've been making
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
motions for the straw votes we do it all
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
at once but we list those three numbers
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
on the spreadsheet you'll see what the
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
original plan was you'll see what the
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
governor's estimate was and then you'll
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
see the range of possibilities that was
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
given us from the experts which are the
 
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
agencies that manage these things and I
 
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
think today almost everything is from
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
the dra so and we have the pro here
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
I would recognize representative Platt
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm going to
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
propose numbers for the utility property
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
tax and the thinking behind my numbers
 
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
is that the agency has done a great job
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
coming up with its estimates and I'm
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
essentially splitting the difference
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
between their high and low and I heard
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
comments the other day about record
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
profits well the utility in the utility
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
property tax is partly based on Netbook
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
and partly on Revenue estimates but uh
 
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:24.419 align:start position:0%
the the revenues uh I I just happen to
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
be I came from science technology energy
 
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
my background was utilities I look at
 
00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:31.160 align:start position:0%
ISO to go today we look at their prices
 
00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:33.419 align:start position:0%
they're they're three three and a half
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
cents which is down to where they were
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
before uh things went crazy a year and a
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
half ago so yeah the profits are not
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
there anymore and I don't expect once we
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
go into this uh I don't expect much
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
difficulty with
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
the with the generators
 
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
uh there that I don't see record profits
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
go continuing and the utilities the
 
00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
polls and wires utilities they charge uh
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
for fixed costs with a kilowatt hour
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
basis uh rates per kilowatt hour so if
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of sales their profits
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
do go up but then they go down when they
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the sales and I just don't
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
see anything sustaining those sales so
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'm coming up with uh for the three
 
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.110 align:start position:0%
I'm coming up with uh for the three
years

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
42.8 which is splitting the agency uh
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
for 24 43.5
 
00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:25.700 align:start position:0%
and for
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
fy25 44.1
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
just so you guys can see what we're
 
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
looking at on this spreadsheet
 
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
um when it says hwm estimate on line 13
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
19 and 25 that's house Ways and Means so
 
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
that's the number we're trying to plug
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
in right now
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
so everyone got those
 
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
great do I have a second for that
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:58.190 align:start position:0%
 
43.5

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
43.5
 
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
so that would be the midpoint between
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
the agency's low estimate and the
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
agency's high estimate is that what
 
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
you're saying yes okay is there a second
 
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
representative fellow seconds
 
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
now we'll open it to questions comments
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that
 
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.370 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that
um

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
FY 23
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering whether that's affected At
 
00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
All by what uh what income profits uh
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
utilities may be making now given that
 
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much baked in what their
 
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.150 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much baked in what their
um

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
their property tax is going to be
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
my answer is the agency would have taken
 
00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start position:0%
that into account in their estimates and
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
they and so I'm splitting the difference
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
um could we ask the commissioner
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
why there's such a range when I thought
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members the
 
00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:30.059 align:start position:0%
committee welcome to new members today
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
Lindsey stepp commissioner New Hampshire
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
um the reason for their ranges is that
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
there even though the values are set on
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
December 15th for the prior April 1st
 
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.149 align:start position:0%
December 15th for the prior April 1st
those

00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
the estimates that we receive after that
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
date are really for the tax year for the
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
next April 1st where those final values
 
00:21:57.289 --> 00:21:57.299 align:start position:0%
will not get determined until next
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
December so typically utilities true up
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
between their estimates and their actual
 
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
so utilities may make additional or may
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
modify the payments that we're going to
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
receive between now and the end of
 
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 in anticipation of what their
 
00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:21.539 align:start position:0%
value for this coming April 1st is going
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
to be so that's how you kind of end up
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
with a range
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
so even though the value is known
 
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
they're also making estimates
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
essentially for the next year so that's
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
the reason for the range and some
 
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
I think you had mentioned too in your
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
presentation that they could appeal in
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
this so there's a little wiggle room
 
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059 align:start position:0%
there in case they appeal so that's a
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
great Point utilities can appeal the
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
valuations they had until February 15th
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
to do so we did have appeals come in so
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
there is some unknown about the amount
 
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
of Revenue that we will receive for the
 
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
remainder of the year because of that
 
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059 align:start position:0%
representative so forth uh thank you and
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
partly about procedures too my numbers
 
00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
were about a million more than the
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
previous Representatives but I'm also
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
wondering uh to what extent a million
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
dollars difference we're going to be
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
well that's why we're discussing this if
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
the million dollars is really important
 
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
to you we'll listen to your logic but I
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
think yeah a million dollars may not be
 
00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
worth a lot of discussion so you know I
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
think depending I would concur if that's
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
how other people felt but I I was a
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
little higher than his for what I do
 
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.789 align:start position:0%
little higher than his for what I do
okay

00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
plus we can do it later
 
00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:45.299 align:start position:0%
true I'd rather if we can get to a
 
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
consensus on each individual item we're
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
building up kind of building it up from
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
the bottom up versus like a top-down
 
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:54.059 align:start position:0%
number right so if we if we agree on the
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
bot this number and the other blocks
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
we'll get to a number that I think we
 
00:23:59.450 --> 00:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
can all agree on
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh it's you already second the motion so
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
is there any more discussion
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh welcome
 
00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:09.299 align:start position:0%
especially those from the educational
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
side of things God bless you
 
00:24:15.169 --> 00:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so in
 
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
your numbers I I know we talked about
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
this a little bit before but you've
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
baked in everything you can possibly
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
think of is that correct inflation
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
what you know a meteor falling from the
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
sky whatever
 
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
maybe not the meteor
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
um but yes we have tried to analyze you
 
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
know everything that's kind of happening
 
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
um again as I've mentioned previously
 
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
maybe not by making specific adjustments
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
to the revenue estimates but using
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
inflation profits of utilities
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
valuations that we've seen new types of
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
utilities potentially coming online that
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
has informed us on which scenarios to
 
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
present to you as part of our range so
 
00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.370 align:start position:0%
present to you as part of our range so
yes

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:00.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear representative
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
southworth's uh reasons for adding a
 
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
million I think we're talking just about
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
the first one because the other ones
 
00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.210 align:start position:0%
the first one because the other ones
flow

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
flow
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
from it yes that's exactly right I think
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
um I felt that um it more optimistic
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
about 2023 and then the other two flow
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
and why are you more optimistic may I
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
yeah um because I do think um the
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
returns will be I mean I understand her
 
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:39.539 align:start position:0%
explanation that they might not be
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
steady but
 
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
the changes will happen more in the
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
future and that won't necessarily
 
00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
there'll be changed right now in the
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
last few months of the 2023.
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify representative
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
Southworth you're talking about
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
potentially editing his motion for FY
 
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
2023 to 43
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
um no I think we have to vote on his
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
motion I was just giving my input and I
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
think my input just is that I felt that
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
by the time we finished 2023 it will be
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
stronger let's say a little closer to
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
the governors for the figures on here a
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
little closer to their high end than the
 
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:22.740 align:start position:0%
42 Point um
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
one that he put for
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
that okay but it's not something that's
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
a hugely important to me if I'm just
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
all the comments yes representative Ames
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
the question to the commissioner um the
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
governor's estimates are higher and um
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
I can't remember the budget director was
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
here but
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
has there been an adjustment from the
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
governor's office do they agree with a
 
00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
lower number
 
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
I won't I don't know for sure if they
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree with the lower number
 
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
I think the difference between the
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
numbers is the timing of the estimates
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
so the governor
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
um was presented with a range of
 
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
estimates at the end of December we came
 
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
to you with estimates at the end of
 
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
January January is a month where we
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
receive utility property tax revenue so
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
it's just an example of updated numbers
 
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
based on more Revenue coming in
 
00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
I'm looking back at my notes that I took
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
when the governor's person came in and
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
his revised estimate was 40 it was
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
originally 47.1 and then he said now he
 
00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:42.419 align:start position:0%
said it was 46.3 just so you know that's
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
what I had in my notes
 
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
so it was it's uh
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
still higher than what we're talking
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
about but not as high yes representative
 
00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
Phyllis I'm thank you madam chair I'm
 
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.370 align:start position:0%
Phyllis I'm thank you madam chair I'm
looking

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:57.539 align:start position:0%
to document the version that we got
 
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
earlier the version we got on
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
maybe February 7th
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
and on page 50 it gives you like 10
 
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
years of the actual
 
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
revenue from this tax so it's really it
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
the the green line across here is just
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
above 40 and you can even see from where
 
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
you are that it you know it kind of goes
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
either side of
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
representative horse
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so when I'm
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
looking at your numbers
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
you exceed the governor's estimate in
 
00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:44.690 align:start position:0%
you exceed the governor's estimate in
2025.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
it's correct so on the high end or we
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
come close to oh I'm sorry
 
00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:54.059 align:start position:0%
uh our high in 2025 is above the the
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
governor so the reason for that is you
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
will see the governor's estimate is flat
 
00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
in all three years 47.1 our range is the
 
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
result of a small amount of growth in
 
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
the tax so that's how we end up slightly
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
Higher by 2025 so we start out lower but
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
we assume the high estimate assumes a
 
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:13.860 align:start position:0%
small amount of growth and so we end up
 
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
a little bit higher by 2025. okay thank
 
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:18.059 align:start position:0%
you and uh can I make a short statement
 
00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:21.539 align:start position:0%
sure so having done this kind of work
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
myself I think I hopefully can just
 
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
help the committee with any angst they
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
might have in the Numbers number one
 
00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:33.299 align:start position:0%
number uh number two
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
being that I was a registered
 
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
independent for years until I got tired
 
00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:42.299 align:start position:0%
of waiting in line and I ended up in the
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
party that I am now
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
I'd love her numbers that's all I wanted
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
all right so we have a motion
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
unless there's more discussion
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
all those in favor accepting
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
representative palette's motion please
 
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
okay it looks unanimous that is
 
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
wonderful and so uh how many people do
 
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:10.820 align:start position:0%
we have here can you count that
 
00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
I I think it's 18 but somewhere else
 
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I used to teach math maybe I
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
could help representative we might need
 
00:30:40.679 --> 00:30:41.810 align:start position:0%
could help representative we might need
that

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
the education committee is here because
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
okay so let's take a look at Insurance
 
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
what column would that be guys
 
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.870 align:start position:0%
what column would that be guys
f

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
f
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay column F on page four at least on
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
my copy
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
which is the insurance tax
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
also very tight numbers between the
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
my my uh suggestion is we don't bucket
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh that the governor and the agency are
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
right on the uh Copa static essentially
 
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
so I go with the agency numbers of 139
 
00:31:39.649 --> 00:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
139 and 142. is that your motion that is
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
my motion is there a second to that
 
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative fellows seconds the
 
00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.769 align:start position:0%
representative fellows seconds the
motion

00:31:45.769 --> 00:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay now we're open to discussion
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative only
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we have sufficient
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
analysis by them or by and obviously we
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
can't do it
 
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.549 align:start position:0%
can't do it
um but

00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
in with the lack of that I go along with
 
00:32:17.409 --> 00:32:17.419 align:start position:0%
what they've got
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
just FYI for everyone here we would hope
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
to have another Insurance presentation
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
yesterday but we got snowed out we did
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
get an email with more data
 
00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
um certainly once we get through some of
 
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
our deadlines of other bills that we
 
00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
need to hear and so forth if we want to
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
have them come in and work with us we
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
can certainly do that
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
should we take insurance out on our rest
 
00:32:41.529 --> 00:32:41.539 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
I um I'm content to go forward but I do
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
want to put this caveat in
 
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
um we don't have insurance here and we
 
00:32:59.510 --> 00:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
all know why and that's fine but they
 
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
did send us something and that was
 
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
helpful and I want to point out amongst
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
the other uncertainties is the Medicaid
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
expansion program which uh Mr Betancourt
 
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
spoke to on the second page of his
 
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
his submission Under The Heading Health
 
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
Care Market a major issue first it is
 
00:33:21.529 --> 00:33:21.539 align:start position:0%
important to remember that the revenue
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
collected from the mcos for the Medicaid
 
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
expansion program is segregate
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
segregated to pay a portion of the
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
state's 10 non-federal share second as
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
you're aware are aware the state is
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
going to begin the process of
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
redetermining the Medicaid eligibility
 
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:42.059 align:start position:0%
for 101 000 people of that HHS is
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
projecting that 59 000 individuals will
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
be ineligible
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
and finally it is unclear where those
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
individuals will get coverage we know
 
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
that some portion of them will migrate
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
to the individual Market but we don't
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
know how many or the impact on premiums
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
and I highlight that just because it
 
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
there is a level of uncertainty in this
 
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
one and in some of the others we've
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
already dealt with and that are coming
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
up and I really think it's important
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
that we reconvene on the revenue issue
 
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.669 align:start position:0%
that we reconvene on the revenue issue
um

00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
you know after two or three weeks
 
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
um when we'll have more information for
 
00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:25.220 align:start position:0%
sure on the uh the major dra
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
revenues and maybe as well we'll begin
 
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
to have effects on what's happening with
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
I concur exactly on that because we we
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
we're hamstrung a little bit right now
 
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
with data but we hopefully I'm thinking
 
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
about a month from now we'll be in a
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
better place to have some answers there
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
representative Almy
 
00:34:48.359 --> 00:34:49.250 align:start position:0%
representative Almy
yeah

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to point out that
 
00:34:56.089 --> 00:34:56.099 align:start position:0%
whatever change happens in the insurance
 
00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
Market because of a very bad decision
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
made about I don't know 12 or more years
 
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.349 align:start position:0%
made about I don't know 12 or more years
ago

00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
um they're
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
by the Senate naturally there was on
 
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
there is a doubling of that change from
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
year to year so it's very unlikely we
 
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
end up with the same numbers year after
 
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.710 align:start position:0%
end up with the same numbers year after
year

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
and if there's a big change it will be
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
twice as big that year and
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
okay all those in favor accepting the
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
motion to accept the
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
the agency estimate which is across the
 
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.329 align:start position:0%
the agency estimate which is across the
board

00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:50.339 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's unanimous anyway in
 
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.530 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's unanimous anyway in
opposed

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:35:59.329 --> 00:35:59.339 align:start position:0%
great so if our numbers are right that
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
would be 18.
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
okay uh right next to that is e interest
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
you're gonna be bold again okay you're
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
representative but again the agents has
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
put a lot of thought into this and I
 
00:36:22.609 --> 00:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
don't see anything I mean yes we're
 
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
going to face a recession uh but but I
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
don't see how that affects necessarily
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax of
 
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
significantly and so I would go with the
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
midpoint of the
 
00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.210 align:start position:0%
midpoint of the
agency

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
which was one-third is 135 in
 
00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:42.740 align:start position:0%
uh 2023
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
112.8 in 2024
 
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
and 89.4
 
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.470 align:start position:0%
and 89.4
in

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
2025 and the 89.4 matches the governor
 
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.150 align:start position:0%
2025 and the 89.4 matches the governor
the

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
1.128 matches the governor the 135 is
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
the it also matches it so it's a
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
Governor's estimates all through in this
 
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.950 align:start position:0%
Governor's estimates all through in this
case

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
which is lot the low side of midpoint I
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
think of the agency
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
representative Southwest Essence thank
 
00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.589 align:start position:0%
representative Southwest Essence thank
you

00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
okay let's talk through it
 
00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
this one is one of the most volatile
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
and the governors and and the agency see
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
it going down
 
00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
we should we
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
just lost that's built into the law
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
but let's go five four three two and
 
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:53.930 align:start position:0%
but let's go five four three two and
they're

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
and they're taking it down the next two
 
00:37:59.089 --> 00:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
times does that include
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
the reduction in rates yes yeah oh there
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
on so what is the equivalent of that in
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
of where we are now if we had the same
 
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
because if we do have a recession it
 
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
so the estimates the governor's
 
00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.170 align:start position:0%
so the estimates the governor's
estimates

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
assume I and D will be flat
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
23 24 and 25 and the reason for the
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
reduction is the change in the rate the
 
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:59.290 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:38:59.290 --> 00:38:59.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
estimate that the impact in fiscal 24
 
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
will be 22.2 million and the impact in
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 will be
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
from the tax law change so it's really
 
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
just a flat number and then applying the
 
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
tax law change is how you get the
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative Spielberg
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
I think further looking at dra's
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
methodology they are projecting uh low
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
to high being based on a zero percent
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
and a two percent growth
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
so something that splits the difference
 
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
or comes close to that at the governor's
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
level is essentially estimating one
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:11.690 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.250 align:start position:0%
representative
I

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
I am not sure that I have the document
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
with me about on where the growth has
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
gone but I do know that last year's was
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
the strongest
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
grew 22 percent last year over the prior
 
00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.349 align:start position:0%
grew 22 percent last year over the prior
year

00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
that was fiscal 22 grew 22 over fiscal
 
00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:53.099 align:start position:0%
21 fiscal 21 grew 17.8 percent over
 
00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
fiscal 20
 
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:02.339 align:start position:0%
was a decline of 4.6 percent over fiscal
 
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
19 and fiscal 19 was a 7.4 percent over
 
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
fiscal 18.
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
so yes we have seen significant growth
 
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
in the last two years with interest in
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
dividends tax
 
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
Madame Jared
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry I can't see you over
 
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
there apologize representative
 
00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:23.579 align:start position:0%
Southworth he likes to really focus on
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
um just to confirm this tax again is
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.140 align:start position:0%
again kind of like the upside down
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
triangle yes probably not to the same
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
extent as the business taxes but yes it
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
has that similar effect of the triangle
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
where the point of the triangle or the
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
majority of the revenue is from a few
 
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
number of taxpayers so you're really
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
talking about how stable their
 
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
Investments are over the next two years
 
00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
correct and if you remember from the
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
presentation the majority of at this
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
point the majority of the interest in
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
dividends taxes coming from
 
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
distributions and so to the extent that
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
distributions and dividends decline due
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
to a slowing in the economy that would
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
slow your growth in IND so I think
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
that's how we kind of arrive at that
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
zero to two percent
 
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
increases that we anticipate the economy
 
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
slowing we understand that the majority
 
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
of the IND revenue is driven by
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
distributions and dividends and so when
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
that economy slows the growth in those
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
areas will slow as well causing the tax
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
to slow
 
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
thank you so again Madam chair I was
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
leaning higher but I think
 
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
um when you mix those factors in I'm
 
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with one percent or one
 
00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.270 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with one percent or one
percent

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
of Ames and then I think representative
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
Platt did you have your Independence my
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
question just got answered okay okay
 
00:42:50.339 --> 00:42:51.290 align:start position:0%
question just got answered okay okay
good

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.390 align:start position:0%
good
Samson

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
Samson
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
my question to you commissioner is um
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
is uh when we will know with greater
 
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
certainty the FY 23 numbers and is it
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
true that at the end of April
 
00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
you will have a pretty good fix of how
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
these where these going to come out
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
whether they'll be low or high or
 
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.309 align:start position:0%
whether they'll be low or high or
midpoint

00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
midpoint
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct so April is the most
 
00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:17.339 align:start position:0%
telling month for the interest in
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
dividends tax because it is the month
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
where we receive return and extension
 
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
payments for the prior calendar year and
 
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
also the month that we receive third
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
quarter estimate payments for the
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
current year so we get prior year
 
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
information and current year information
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of April the only the only
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
thing that's outstanding before the
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
close of the fiscal year is June
 
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
estimated payments so but June estimated
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
payments would be the last quarter
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
payment so we generally have a decent
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
idea of what those payments are going to
 
00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
look like because we have three quarters
 
00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
of estimates preceding it so yes long
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
answer or short answer yes it'll be the
 
00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:56.579 align:start position:0%
end of April we'll have a much better
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
idea thank
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you madam chair
 
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
is it the numbers that were going up
 
00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
substantially I think was 21 22. is that
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
money possibly driven by the influx of
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
cash that came out of Washington number
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
one and number two
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
my stock portfolio is like it's dropped
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
like a rock and so I'm just wondering my
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
stock advisor doesn't even want to meet
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
with me he suggested counseling
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I'm seeing the trend going
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
you came up but I'm seeing it heading
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
down substantially for a little while
 
00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
your your guess
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
so going back to kind of what I said
 
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
earlier I think we feel like the growth
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
that we've seen the
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
17.8 percent the 22 percent growth
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
largely driven by influx of money and
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
profits in the economy
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
um but that that growth is going to
 
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
isn't there a caveat to that again
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
another one of these things that
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
um interest
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
coming in maybe maybe significantly
 
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.170 align:start position:0%
coming in maybe maybe significantly
higher

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
I just want to get for you the breakdown
 
00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
again of Interest dividends in
 
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:31.970 align:start position:0%
again of Interest dividends in

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%

interest
 
00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:34.710 align:start position:0%

2021
 
00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:41.579 align:start position:0%
represented nine percent of the total
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax that we
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
receive so I think even with an increase
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the interest due to interest rates
 
00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
Rising the decrease that we're going to
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
see in the remaining 91 percent of the
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%

representative Army
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have how much uh the
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
revenue dipped in the.com I wouldn't
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
want to compare it with a Great
 
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
Recession I don't think it's going to go
 
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
that far
 
00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
do you want to give me specific years in

00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
from 2000 to 2001 grew 17.9 percent from
 
00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:08.339 align:start position:0%
2001 to 2002 it dropped seven percent

from 2002 to 2003 it dropped 21.1

2003 to 2004 dropped 4.7 percent and
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
then 2004 to 2005 we saw growth of 24.5
 
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.710 align:start position:0%
then 2004 to 2005 we saw growth of 24.5

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
so that was a mild but
 
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.809 align:start position:0%
so that was a mild but
but

00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
targeted towards the strengths of New
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh recession on or the
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
weaknesses in that particular case
 
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
but I want to remind people also when
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
we're looking at what happens in April
 
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
it was last year
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
It's a combination of returns for last
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
year and estimated payments and we can
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
break that out for you and give you that
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
breakdown between return and extension
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
payments which to representative almie's
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
point would be last calendar year versus
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
those that are estimated payments for
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%

representative fellows did you have a
 
00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.410 align:start position:0%
representative fellows did you have a
question

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
um can you just explain to me the
 
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:18.140 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
distributions and dividends I know what
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
Dividends are but what how what are
 
00:48:25.849 --> 00:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
distributions so we provided to you via
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
of the things that fall within the
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax but
 
00:48:37.609 --> 00:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
distributions would be a distribution
 
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
that you receive from a corporation as
 
00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
opposed to a dividend so similar idea
 
00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
um they're just categorized slightly
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
differently in how they're laid out on
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
the form so that's how why we break them
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
out but there's a really long list of
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
everything that falls under the interest
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
in dividends taxes that we provided to
 
00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
so do they generally go up and down at
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.569 align:start position:0%
the same
rate

00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
I don't have the breakdown of the data
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
for the time period that I just read you
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
the changes in the tax but let me just
 
00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.750 align:start position:0%
the changes in the tax but let me just
look

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:34.130 align:start position:0%
look
quickly

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
in what we provided to see if I can
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
gleam anything
 
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
they do seem to generally track
 
00:50:08.579 --> 00:50:14.890 align:start position:0%
they do seem to generally track
consistently

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:14.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury I apologize you
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
know just so you know guys because it's
 
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
a little hard to see if if you know you
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
want to ask a question or speak if you
 
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
turn on your mic I'll see the red I'll
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
I was just thinking maybe I could help
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative fellows with an
 
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%
illustration of not a Hardline
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
definition of the difference between
 
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
dividends and distributions but
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
dividends tend to be something that is
 
00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.770 align:start position:0%
dividends tend to be something that is
issued

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
issued
 
00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
on a more or less regular basis for
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
example quarterly
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
a certain percentage and what have you
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
of profits distributions tend to be
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
something that's more of a unusual
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
situation one-time event
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
for example if there's say a sale of a
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
division of a corporation
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
or subsidiary
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
and that sale may be partially a stock
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
sale partially a cash sale the cash then
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
may be distributed
 
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
to the shareholders so it is based on
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
your percentage ownership shares but
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's because of a one-time event
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
another example would be smaller closely
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
held corporations where you have a few
 
00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:30.059 align:start position:0%
owners and they're essentially dividing
 
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
out the profits at the end of a year in
 
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
order that's the way they get their cash
 
00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:36.260 align:start position:0%
as opposed to say for example the
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:46.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
on the table
 
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
everyone knows what that is right
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
every everyone opposed raise your hand
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
okay want to post right okay the two I
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
apologize okay
 
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
what let's keep going and uh let's go
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
that we've all got the same numbers
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
could somebody so I believe uh under
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
column e interest and dividends
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers that were put forth for 2023
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
were 135
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
and for 2020
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
but that was 2024 I hope I said that
 
00:52:59.930 --> 00:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:03.049 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.059 --> 00:53:19.069 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.130 align:start position:0%
 
gotcha

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
gotcha
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh all right so we also we have what
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
three more to go these are the tougher
 
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
ones obviously with a lot more moving
 
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.970 align:start position:0%
ones obviously with a lot more moving
Parts

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
Parts
 
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:35.809 align:start position:0%
Parts
um

00:53:35.809 --> 00:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
let's let's take a stab at business
 
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
taxes that's the big one
 
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
I know but we got to do it
 
00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:44.780 align:start position:0%
we're gonna rip the Band-Aid off
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:49.970 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
I would like to make a motion I'll
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
say what my free numbers are and then
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
after we have a second speak to them
 
00:53:59.569 --> 00:53:59.579 align:start position:0%
so for
 
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
FY 23
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh one two three five
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.569 --> 00:54:11.579 align:start position:0%
we're FY 24
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh one one nine eight one billion 198
 
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.089 align:start position:0%
uh one one nine eight one billion 198
million

00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:17.099 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
and for fy25
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh one one seven four one billion one
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
okay I need a second and then we'll open
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
second okay representative Platt seconds
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay now
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
let's talk about it representative orrs
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
Madam chair can I make a counter motion
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
or let's say not yet let's talk through
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
this but it'll be apparent in our
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
discussion what your thoughts are okay
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
oh my thoughts were we just round these
 
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
numbers up
 
00:54:58.329 --> 00:54:58.339 align:start position:0%
it's the accountant to me yeah
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
I thought you'd want to balance to the
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
penny uh representative Platt Madam
 
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
chair I'm I'll accept these numbers but
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm even more pessimistic than those
 
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
numbers represent we're facing a
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
recession a timing is uh not sure
 
00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:16.220 align:start position:0%
certain but the feds are going to keep
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
racking up interest rates and that's
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
going to put a big damper on the economy
 
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
it's happening already and I I read all
 
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
sorts of stories in the Wall Street
 
00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
Journal factual stories that lead me to
 
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
concern uh people running up credit card
 
00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
debt like crazy uh the the Walmart and
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
Home Depot saying people are getting the
 
00:55:39.049 --> 00:55:39.059 align:start position:0%
cheapest things they can they're
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
downside down to being Thrifty and all
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
sorts of stories like that so I'd be
 
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
even much more pessimistic but uh so
 
00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
anyway I'll support the numbers
 
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
reluctantly because to me they're too
 
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:53.890 align:start position:0%
reluctantly because to me they're too
high

00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:53.900 align:start position:0%
high
 
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
you want to tell us how you got to that
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of debate and no certainty
 
00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
about whether we will or will not have a
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
recession whether the FED will magically
 
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
uh have a soft Landing or not
 
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
but the one thing that's clear
 
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
is that the FED is on a mission and
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
they're being very explicit about it and
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
their goal to tame inflation is going to
 
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.109 align:start position:0%
their goal to tame inflation is going to
require

00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
that they push interest rates up even
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
further than where they are so far uh
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
most typical estimates I'm seeing are
 
00:56:35.089 --> 00:56:35.099 align:start position:0%
that will end up around 5.5 percent
 
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
which could be another three raises or
 
00:56:39.849 --> 00:56:39.859 align:start position:0%
four this year maybe another percent
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
more importantly whatever they end up at
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to hold them there
 
00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
for a good year to the optimistic
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
scenario that they're going to somehow
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
hit this magic little balance and
 
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
immediately start tapering
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
is highly unlikely
 
00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
so when you look for analogies in the
 
00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:02.339 align:start position:0%
past it's hard to find one this is
 
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
certainly very different from 2008 nine
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's a bit more analogous to
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
what was going on in the late 70s
 
00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that their concerns
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
being expressed by experts that we may
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
enter stagflation If the Fed is not
 
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
aggressive enough and not successful
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
but what's really different is that
 
00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
recessions usually occur
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
because of market dynamics
 
00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
and the federal government following the
 
00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:35.339 align:start position:0%
theories of Keynesian economics
 
00:57:38.089 --> 00:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
will typically then step in
 
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
to try and counter the rest recession
 
00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
with fiscal stimulus
 
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
this is not going to happen this time
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
because what's different is that this
 
00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
rest this recession
 
00:57:52.609 --> 00:57:52.619 align:start position:0%
is manufactured by the government to
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
address a bigger problem which is the
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
risk of persistent inflation
 
00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
so I think when we see head fakes from
 
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
the market optimism uh and and your
 
00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.059 align:start position:0%
watch stocks as a barometer there's
 
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
almost an inverse relation that you can
 
00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
anticipate the more those stocks start
 
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
to Surge up based on optimism
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
the more the FED Governors will sit down
 
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
at their next meeting and say huh our
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
message hasn't gotten through we need to
 
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
be even more aggressive so the recession
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
to one degree or another is going to
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
come and when it comes the typical
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
reaction of fiscal stimulus won't be
 
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.069 align:start position:0%
reaction of fiscal stimulus won't be
there

00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
so I am predicting that for 23
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
the midpoint is
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
1.238 and I settled on a round figure
 
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
just below that so just a little bit
 
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
more pessimistic than the midpoint for
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
the balance of this year based on what I
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
see in the January and February numbers
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
and by the way just two caveats we don't
 
00:58:59.569 --> 00:58:59.579 align:start position:0%
need to explain because we've all talked
 
00:59:03.049 --> 00:59:03.059 align:start position:0%
about it that includes a distinct uptick
 
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
in refunds
 
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of months and it
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
includes our knowledge that we have a
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
large amount of tax carry forwards in
 
00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
our state treasury
 
00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
that companies may claim in a time when
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
their cash is tighter in a recession
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
so therefore my presumption for 2024
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
is that we decline three percent from
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
from that level from the million from
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
the 1 billion 235
 
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
down to 1198 is a three percent drop
 
00:59:42.289 --> 00:59:42.299 align:start position:0%
and that we have then declined two
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
percent further in 25 so that's my
 
00:59:45.119 --> 00:59:47.870 align:start position:0%
percent further in 25 so that's my
rationale

00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other comments
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative almie
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you we did get a
 
00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
on explanation of the major refunds we
 
00:59:59.450 --> 00:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
saw in the last two months which was
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
that it was related to the distribute to
 
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
the companies that which are usually
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
very big companies that get an extension
 
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
until October
 
01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:13.670 align:start position:0%
until October
uh

01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.849 align:start position:0%
uh
and

01:00:16.849 --> 01:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
I agree with you on a lot of this
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
on but added to that we do not know what
 
01:00:29.329 --> 01:00:29.339 align:start position:0%
the tax structural tax changes we made
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the credit carry forward
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
there's also what the single sales
 
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
factor is going to
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
show to us next year not this year but
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.410 align:start position:0%
next year
um

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.450 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
and we have been chipping away at
 
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
at the rates of the tax which always
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
have a lag of one to two years in when
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
they tell us that it's made a difference
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
01:01:00.839 --> 01:01:02.089 align:start position:0%
so we have
it's

01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
it's just pretty impossible I think too
 
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:08.579 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
01:01:08.579 --> 01:01:10.069 align:start position:0%
look at this
but

01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
I would go with with your numbers
 
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
more on
 
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid but I just point out that
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
they will be rounded if you look down
 
01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
the numbers that
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
that's totally acceptable to me strange
 
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
numbers on them are ones that that were
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
put in the kafir which I refuse to call
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
an act for
 
01:01:37.859 --> 01:01:40.329 align:start position:0%
an act for
aquifer

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:40.339 align:start position:0%
aquifer
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
somebody says agva yeah aquifer yeah
 
01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:49.849 align:start position:0%
somebody says agva yeah aquifer yeah
representative

01:01:49.849 --> 01:01:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
well I guess I'm The Optimist you turned
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
your mic off by mistake oh yeah I was
 
01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:58.140 align:start position:0%
just turning off the signal but now I'm
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
back on
 
01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.470 align:start position:0%
back on
um

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm The Optimist
 
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
um if you want to call me that or maybe
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm the skeptic who's sat here for 10
 
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:14.579 align:start position:0%
years as we've made predictions at this
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
time of year
 
01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:18.260 align:start position:0%
that often are wrong
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
of recessions or of uh of good times and
 
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
um so I I I guess another word would be
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
humility I approach this task with a a
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
lot of humility and uh not too much
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
confidence in what economists have to
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
say nor do I take any anything from what
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
the stock market's doing one month to
 
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.589 align:start position:0%
um so I
I

01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
um and also I I had the experience time
 
01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
in year in and year out of seeing Ways
 
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
and Means numbers uh
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
um replaced by Senate numbers which uh
 
01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
are always higher and that's because
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
they've got better numbers they say well
 
01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:09.059 align:start position:0%
we had numbers but we chose to be
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
cautious and uh so I'm I'm sort of at
 
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
the point where I'm throwing caution to
 
01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
the wind and wanting to apply to these
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
numbers the information that I've gotten
 
01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:27.059 align:start position:0%
uh that was all of us have received that
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh for example that the dra believes
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
that the low and the high are both
 
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
credible numbers
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
and they've thought hard about inflation
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
and recession possibilities and
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
timing of payments by different kinds of
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
businesses and so forth and so on so I I
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
take a lot from that
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
and certainly would not go as low as as
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
this motion would take us in fiscal year
 
01:03:59.089 --> 01:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
25 I wouldn't get close to that
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
um so uh I'm going to be voting against
 
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
representative I would ask
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Schomburg what his number
 
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
same same sorry
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
yeah well
 
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.890 align:start position:0%
yeah well
um

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
is that in order
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we're having a discussion so yeah I
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
mean I think what I just heard is you're
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned with the 2025
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
number did you have some other thoughts
 
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
on how to get to that number five number
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
I would I would uh
 
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
thank you other discussion
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
and oh I'm sorry representative
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
Southworth is your thing on yeah okay
 
01:04:58.370 --> 01:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to you after
 
01:04:59.809 --> 01:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
representative orders probably have to
 
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
like hold this up I yes I apologize
 
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
we'll do ORS and then it's all you
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair so yes I was
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
noticing uh 2025 the agency estimate is
 
01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
higher and it gave me pause that maybe
 
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
is correct in that maybe that number
 
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:24.380 align:start position:0%
instead of one one seven four might be
 
01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
one point
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
two or one point nine
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry one nine uh as I mentioned
 
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
earlier uh I'm looking at what looks
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
like around the number so I have a
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
question for the commissioner
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
being that the agency number is well
 
01:05:44.089 --> 01:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
above the governor's number more than a
 
01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
rounding error
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
do we have an explanation as to how the
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
agency got there I'm sure you have one
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
um our high estimate
 
01:06:23.089 --> 01:06:23.099 align:start position:0%
assumes that our percent over plan is
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
maintained through the end of the year
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
was subtracting the tax law changes
 
01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:33.059 align:start position:0%
the low assumes
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
that we kind of remain
 
01:06:36.299 --> 01:06:36.890 align:start position:0%
that we kind of remain
um

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
what we've seen here to date and then we
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
are at plan for the rest of the year so
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the two different
 
01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.230 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the two different
scenarios

01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
scenarios
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
that you see
 
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
you're asking about fiscal 23 correct
 
01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
five five the height the high okay
 
01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:55.190 align:start position:0%
five five the height the high okay
so

01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
the high in
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
25 is the result of remaining 33 ahead
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
of plan for the rest of 23.
 
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
two percent growth from 23 to 24 and
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
another two percent growth from 24 to
 
01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.789 align:start position:0%
another two percent growth from 24 to
25.

01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
25.
 
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimate assumes no
 
01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimate assumes no
growth

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
growth
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
and the year to the year changes are
 
01:07:24.289 --> 01:07:24.299 align:start position:0%
just the result of changes in the tax
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
law so we essentially our high is two
 
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
years of two percent growth as opposed
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
to the governor assuming no
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
year-over-year growth that we don't go
 
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
into a recession we don't decline year
 
01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
over year until you take the tax law
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
changes into effect but instead we just
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
kind of stay flat for two years okay
 
01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
thank you follow-up question please
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
so I know you may not be answer able to
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
answer what I'm thinking but based on
 
01:07:55.569 --> 01:07:55.579 align:start position:0%
what I heard from representative Ames
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
Terry that was a joke uh so it sounds to
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
me like
 
01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
we're good I mean I'm good with the
 
01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
numbers being presented here with the
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
exception of 2025 based on the fact that
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
the governor shows no growth
 
01:08:25.249 --> 01:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
and I think in 2025 we should show a
 
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
bump in the agency estimate maybe above
 
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
again 1.17 and it should be maybe 1.19
 
01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:33.890 align:start position:0%
again 1.17 and it should be maybe 1.19
or

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
uh even even a tad more could be 1.2 but
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
the other numbers look good I mean if
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
you had to just hold your thumb up and
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
to win or however you do it would you
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
concur with any of that or just tell me
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
to go home
 
01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
if I held my thumb up in the wind you
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
would get the numbers the agency is high
 
01:08:58.729 --> 01:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:01.259 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth thank you for
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question so again I'm
 
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
picturing the upside down triangle and
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
they're what 16 or so
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
multinationals that basically control a
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.719 --> 01:09:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
I know I'm simplifying but it's I think
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
no you're 20 or less that are the really
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
big so right so for tax year 2020 there
 
01:09:48.839 --> 01:09:49.910 align:start position:0%
big so right so for tax year 2020 there
were

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.950 align:start position:0%
were
um

01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
78 that paid more than a million dollars
 
01:09:57.169 --> 01:09:57.179 align:start position:0%
in tax
 
01:09:57.179 --> 01:09:58.729 align:start position:0%
in tax
um

01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you who they are right
 
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
um but what I think we talked a little
 
01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:04.940 align:start position:0%
bit about
 
01:10:08.890 --> 01:10:08.900 align:start position:0%
on Monday was
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
fairly consistent
 
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
that there's a small number of taxpayers
 
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
that are kind of in that point of the
 
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
triangle but the taxpayers in that point
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
even though I can't tell you who they
 
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
are I can tell you that they can change
 
01:10:27.169 --> 01:10:27.179 align:start position:0%
from time to time yes depending on those
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
Industries or areas of the economy that
 
01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
are performing strongly in that tax year
 
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at
 
01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:37.970 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at
yeah

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
you know we mentioned you might have
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
seen during covid you know medical
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
devices and retailers maybe come into
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
that point of the triangle if we go into
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
an economic slowdown maybe the retailers
 
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
kind of fall out of that trying that
 
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
point in the Triangle but maybe
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
um you know others come in for different
 
01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.410 align:start position:0%
um you know others come in for different
reasons

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so I'm similar I believe to
 
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative Ames I was feeling we
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
could take the midpoint of their low and
 
01:11:09.239 --> 01:11:10.090 align:start position:0%
could take the midpoint of their low and
high

01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:10.100 align:start position:0%
high
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
I think the big questions that really
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
don't have answers yet are would it be a
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
recession I certainly would go along
 
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
with the idea of a Slowdown and also
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
what is the timing as far as how it will
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
hit the years I think that's it's
 
01:11:26.209 --> 01:11:26.219 align:start position:0%
something we can't answer but that's
 
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
basically what we want to know to get
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
these figures more accurate
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
it's your midpoint remind me is that one
 
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
percent per year
 
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
or when it's not quite when I did that
 
01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
would be yes because our range was zero
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
to two yeah before the tax law changes
 
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
so yes into your the point that you're
 
01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
kind of just making in terms of timing
 
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sure people saw in the news this
 
01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:55.550 align:start position:0%
I'm sure people saw in the news this
week

01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
um survey of some economists when they
 
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
were surveyed back in November December
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
time frame felt like we would see an
 
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
economic slowdown or maybe a recession
 
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
happening within you know the first
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
quarter the first half of 2023 they were
 
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
surveyed again last week and they've now
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
bumped that feeling out a couple months
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
right so I think the feeling is that
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a Slowdown
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
I think people thought it was coming now
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
they're not as confident that it's
 
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
coming as soon as it's going to so it to
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
your point it is a timing question yes
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
um and that point kind of keeps moving
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
and question for the chair
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
um would we vote on the motion on the
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
floor first
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
and then we could have because you
 
01:12:38.209 --> 01:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
mentioned some different numbers as well
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
then there can be other motions after
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
that or do we want to slow down and work
 
01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
on the percentages first and then have
 
01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
I mean we have emotion right now we do
 
01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
have a motion and
 
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to hear a little bit more
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
about what we're you know where we're
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
maybe disagreeing uh and what
 
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
percentages people would use
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
um and just to hear a little bit more
 
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
about that and then maybe we'll see if
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
the person who made the motion would
 
01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:06.659 align:start position:0%
like to amend his motion let me try it
 
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
that way representative fellows thank
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
um my first thought is that I don't
 
01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:15.050 align:start position:0%
um my first thought is that I don't
connect

01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
connect
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
the revenue that's going to come in with
 
01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:20.540 align:start position:0%
business profits tax to anybody's
 
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
Investment Portfolio I mean the price of
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
stocks go up and down you know Walmart
 
01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know what their stock
 
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
does but they're going to have strong
 
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
sales no matter what
 
01:13:34.199 --> 01:13:35.930 align:start position:0%
sales no matter what
so

01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
I just I'm not willing to go as low as
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
the proposal for I mean for 20 for 23
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm fine you know with the number
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
proposed but
 
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
I think I think 24 is a little low I'm
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
more inclined to take the agencies in
 
01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
high and low and split them and also do
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
the same thing for 25. but I just I
 
01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:06.980 align:start position:0%
think I think people
 
01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
you know they think about how it fits in
 
01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
how how a recession will hit individuals
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't necessarily change
 
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
income and profits for large
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
corporations which are the ones that are
 
01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
you know primarily are focused that's
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
just my thought
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay other Representatives over here
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
represent Ames your light is on did you
 
01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
want to say something now all right
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
there are two people over there one of
 
01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
them representative Elber
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
I tend to agree with representative Ames
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
and representative fellows that the
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
numbers in 2024 and 2025 are lower than
 
01:15:01.370 --> 01:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
I would be going with and if we wanted
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
to split the difference between the
 
01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
agency's low and high for those two
 
01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:06.169 align:start position:0%
agency's low and high for those two
years

01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
we'd be looking at
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
1.224 in 24 and 1.235
 
01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
in 25 and I would be looking at
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
something kind of in that neighborhood
 
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
okay great yes representative
 
01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
Spielberg now you've got me screwed up
 
01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.050 align:start position:0%
Spielberg now you've got me screwed up
spillsbury

01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.410 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:30.169 --> 01:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
representative fellas I agree with your
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
observation that uh what's going on in
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
an individual portfolio or in the stock
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
market generally isn't an indicator of
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
What kinds of taxes
 
01:15:43.689 --> 01:15:43.699 align:start position:0%
are larger businesses are likely to pass
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
but at the same time it's also not the
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
case that their gross revenues are
 
01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily an indicator of how much
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
taxes they're going to pay
 
01:15:55.729 --> 01:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
what's likely to happen in a recession
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
is their margins are going to get
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
squeezed their revenues May grow without
 
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
pulling their profits up
 
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
so I continue to maintain my concern my
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
very fuzzy crystal ball is just slightly
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
less murky in 24 than it is in 25. I
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
feel fairly strongly in my conviction
 
01:16:17.709 --> 01:16:17.719 align:start position:0%
that we're going to see a downturn
 
01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
sometime in 24 which
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
covers a large band of uncertainty in
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
terms of timing
 
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
from third fourth quarters of 23 to
 
01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
first and second Quarters at 24.
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
so I would not go along with the
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
midpoint concept especially not for 24.
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
now once we set a figure one two three
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
five for 23 and we back it down for
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
three percent at that point
 
01:16:48.649 --> 01:16:48.659 align:start position:0%
going to the midpoint of the agency's
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
estimates for 25 simply is nonsensical
 
01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:54.659 align:start position:0%
because it's predicated on completely
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
different base points for those
 
01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
percentage adjustments however
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
if it would help generate a consensus I
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
think the committee's done an
 
01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:05.780 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily good job in this process
 
01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:08.420 align:start position:0%
of of coming together
 
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
I I would welcome as a friendly
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment the 1190 figure that
 
01:17:17.649 --> 01:17:17.659 align:start position:0%
representative Orr suggested for 25
 
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
and with that adjustment I wonder
 
01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:24.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative Clinton
 
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
well what I've heard others speak they
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
were more uncomfortable with the 1174 in
 
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
25 and so you could make that the same
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
1190 possibly I don't know
 
01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.530 align:start position:0%
1190 possibly I don't know
representative

01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.689 --> 01:17:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
um in trying to
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
take into account the motion and
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
listening to everybody's thoughts
 
01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.450 align:start position:0%
listening to everybody's thoughts
um

01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
I have I do agree with representative
 
01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
spilsbury in in the sense that the FED
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
has stated that they will keep raising
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
rates until they make sure that
 
01:18:05.770 --> 01:18:05.780 align:start position:0%
inflation comes down
 
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
inflation while it's come down a little
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
bit is still stubbornly higher than the
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
FED would like it they want to bring it
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
down to two percent
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
that's still a long far away from where
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
we are right now at somewhere around six
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
to seven percent so the FED is going to
 
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
continue raising those rates that's
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
going to affect
 
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
all sorts of things from Real Estate
 
01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:29.169 align:start position:0%
all sorts of things from Real Estate
um

01:18:29.169 --> 01:18:29.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
purchasing to purchasing
 
01:18:35.689 --> 01:18:35.699 align:start position:0%
automobile whatever interest rates are
 
01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:38.300 align:start position:0%
affected and it's also going to affect
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
the retail sector so I think while
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable to
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
or or knowing that the FED is going to
 
01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
continue doing this
 
01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:53.219 align:start position:0%
and we don't have a model where we can
 
01:18:54.649 --> 01:18:54.659 align:start position:0%
look back to a recession where this
 
01:18:54.659 --> 01:18:55.669 align:start position:0%
look back to a recession where this
matches

01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
matches
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
nicely I think that in 2020 you know I
 
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
think we're pretty much in agreement
 
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
with 2023 that's good
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
um 2024
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I think the number
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury put out was
 
01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.430 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury put out was
1198.

01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
1198.
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
maybe we round that to one two zero zero
 
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
and then the bigger question becomes
 
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
2025 and um
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is
 
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
there's some thought that some feel like
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's going to go down a little more some
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
feel it could be flat
 
01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
I think going to the agency's uh
 
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
midpoint on 2025 might be
 
01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:35.219 align:start position:0%
might be a little over optimistic
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
knowing that you know still remembering
 
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
that the FED is going to continue to
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that inflation is low and to
 
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
do that they could severely have to pull
 
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
the economic
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
nature back so
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
um I so I I would
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
possibly throw out the fact that maybe
 
01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
we leave 2025 flat instead of the two
 
01:20:00.649 --> 01:20:00.659 align:start position:0%
percent decrease then you've got
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
12 35 for 2023 as representative
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
spilsbury said we just round 2024 up to
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
one two zero zero
 
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
still believing that it's you know we're
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
down close to three percent and then
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
2025 flat at 1.2 so I'll kind of throw
 
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
that out there to see how people feel
 
01:20:22.729 --> 01:20:22.739 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you madam chair
 
01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:28.100 align:start position:0%
so uh I want to agree with
 
01:20:31.729 --> 01:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
representative fellow spillsberry
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh janigan and uh Al Berger
 
01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you and that where I think we're
 
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
all in agreement on 2023 uh as I said
 
01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
right off the beginning before we had
 
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
all this discussion I believe 2024
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
should be bumped up a little bit and
 
01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
trying to move things along I think uh
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
rep Janine made a great point about
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
possibly taking that to 1.2 which is a
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
little higher than I initially spoke of
 
01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
but again
 
01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking rounding errors and none
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
of these numbers really concern me with
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
the exception of 2025 and that I think
 
01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea possibly to stay with
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
the 1.2 as a representative dinnigan
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
just said and even if we tweak that a
 
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
little bit we're talking really
 
01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
immaterial dollars here so I would
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
encourage us to come to the consensus
 
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
now and let's move it forward thank you
 
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
I think I agree with that also but I
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
want to remind people inflation is
 
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.990 align:start position:0%
want to remind people inflation is
additive

01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
additive
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
we are talking here dollars before
 
01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
accounting for inflation
 
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
I I think that this is it may actually
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
end up being
 
01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
more than what we're talking about but
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
with worse
 
01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.290 align:start position:0%
with worse
results

01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
because of the inflation
 
01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to check with
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
the representative spilsbury so if we go
 
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.030 align:start position:0%
the representative spilsbury so if we go
with

01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
um 1235 for 2023 you're thinking the
 
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
revenue will drop 35 million for 2024.
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
Justin thank you okay just to make sure
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
I have the right yes
 
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
and uh I think we're in a zone now
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
um where we've pretty much said what
 
01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
needs to be said and we could go for a
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
vote and if if it's the sense of the
 
01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
committee to set 25 at 1.2 even and show
 
01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
it flat for 24.25 I'm perfectly content
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
I have a few more hands up
 
01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative orrs thank you madam
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
chair so uh
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
going right to 2025 I think that we're
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
all good with 2023 and 2024 though I
 
01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
could be wrong and in 2025 I think rep
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
Almy made a great point about the
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
inflation I recently read where
 
01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
Britain's inflation rate is 17 I believe
 
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
our inflation rate based on things I've
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
talked about in previous committee
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
meetings and as I mentioned instead of
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
seeing my stock broker I'm seeing a
 
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.189 align:start position:0%
seeing my stock broker I'm seeing a
psychiatrist

01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist
 
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
that we we look at that number and maybe
 
01:23:30.649 --> 01:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
it is a little higher in 1.2 maybe it's
 
01:23:30.659 --> 01:23:32.110 align:start position:0%
it is a little higher in 1.2 maybe it's
1.23

01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
1.23
 
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
1.24 or five but whatever the number is
 
01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
I agree that there could be a little
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
more bump there in 2020 three and four I
 
01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
don't see it it looks like uh the
 
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
numbers are down thank you
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative I wonder if it would make
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
sense to separate out and just vote on
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
2023 because I believe there's consensus
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
on that get that done and then just
 
01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
I see heads nodding so um do you want to
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
first amend your motion to just 2023 for
 
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
now and then we can try 2024 separately
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
glad to take it in three parts okay
 
01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
great one billion 235 million as our
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
forecast for fy23 okay do I have a
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
second on that
 
01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.250 align:start position:0%
second on that
lburger

01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
lburger
 
01:24:27.169 --> 01:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
excellent okay all those in favor of
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
accepting the 2023 business tax number
 
01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
all those opposed
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
okay unanimous excellent thank you
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
great idea okay so then that brings us
 
01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:47.659 align:start position:0%
to FY 2024
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
and would you like to make a motion
 
01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
again for that
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
yes I'll move that for fy24 we pick the
 
01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
nice round number of 1.2 billion
 
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second for that 200
 
01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
that's a two million Roundup
 
01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
second for that representative all me
 
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
second set thank you
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of accepting that
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
all those opposed raise your hand
 
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
yep yep so one two oh oh
 
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
all right and then let's take a look at
 
01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
2025 representative spillsburg yes so
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
the third motion for fy25 would be uh to
 
01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
hold it flat again at 1.2 million even
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
1.2 billion yeah is there a second for
 
01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:51.950 align:start position:0%
1.2 billion yeah is there a second for
that

01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
oh representative soti seconds that
 
01:25:58.129 --> 01:25:58.139 align:start position:0%
okay all those in favor of that number
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not going to do some counting
 
01:26:06.649 --> 01:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six seven eight
 
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
nine ten eleven so there's 11 and how
 
01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six seven right
 
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay well we have you know a majority
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
that supports that but I'd rather us get
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
closer to something we can agree on uh
 
01:26:37.729 --> 01:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
representative all me
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes I've been thinking since
 
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
there is going to still be inflation
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
going on but we're also going to be
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with more than 10 percent of
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
inflation total in the last few years
 
01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
probably more like 15 on
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
that it should be
 
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
should be up at least
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't think
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
the commissioner considered inflation
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
it would be my same answer previously
 
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:14.219 align:start position:0%
there's not a specific adjustment for
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
inflation but the impact of inflation we
 
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
would say is accounted for in the zero
 
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
to two percent growth rate
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
so if there's an economic downturn but
 
01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.729 align:start position:0%
so if there's an economic downturn but
inflation

01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
helps to buoy that in some to some
 
01:27:29.570 --> 01:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
extent then that would be in the growth
 
01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:33.290 align:start position:0%
extent then that would be in the growth
rate

01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.410 --> 01:27:38.420 align:start position:0%
so uh follow up I would I would go
 
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
considering this because I think the
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
inflation is a lot more than we've dealt
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
with for quite a while on to
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:54.649 --> 01:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
which is about the midpoint I think just
 
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
looking at it
 
01:27:59.629 --> 01:27:59.639 align:start position:0%
one two five so as a terms of a
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
percentage increase from FY 2024 what
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
would that be three
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
percent that's three percent yeah the
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
actual the midpoint of the agency
 
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
estimate is 1.235
 
01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
let's just you know keep in mind we
 
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
think about percentages you know the the
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
dra in their good judgment thinks a zero
 
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
to two percent growth from 2024 to 2025
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
is reasonable so just keep that in mind
 
01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.270 align:start position:0%
is reasonable so just keep that in mind
Representatives

01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:35.699 align:start position:0%
uh thank you just for clarification
 
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
um at least for me even if I don't agree
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
with all the figures that's not to say
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
when we get to the final number that I
 
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
won't you know put it all together and
 
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
support the committee
 
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
but I just reserved you know my opinion
 
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
on some of the individual lines but that
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean I'm not going to support
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
the whole thing at the end
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you for clarifying that
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh other comments Representatives Ms
 
01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.470 align:start position:0%
uh other comments Representatives Ms
Pillsbury

01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
Pillsbury
 
01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:02.870 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
inflation obviously is at play
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
it may inflate prices of goods sold and
 
01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
revenues received but I would remind you
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
that inflation will have two counter
 
01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:15.709 align:start position:0%
that inflation will have two counter
effects

01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
effects
 
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
one is it will also raise the cost of
 
01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
goods sold
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
and the expenses of the corporation and
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
will tend to squeeze the margin because
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
they are running out of room to adjust
 
01:29:31.129 --> 01:29:31.139 align:start position:0%
their prices up further
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
and second I think that companies that
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
run into tight cash times if not
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
outright stress
 
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
will be looking for ways to mitigate
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
taxes and to take refunds against their
 
01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative lburger did you wanna
 
01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:55.310 align:start position:0%
representative lburger did you wanna
yeah

01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
this is one of my I'm new and I'm
 
01:29:59.209 --> 01:29:59.219 align:start position:0%
ignorant questions
 
01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
how if at all do we tax online purchases
 
01:30:08.209 --> 01:30:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we have no sales tax on products
 
01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
liquor gets taxed if you buy it online
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
yeah so you know but if you're buying
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
things from New Hampshire companies
 
01:30:27.169 --> 01:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
theoretically their profits would go up
 
01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
their payroll would go up so they're
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
paying more taxes on all their activity
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:35.930 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:30:38.689 --> 01:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis so
 
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
that's an Amazon pay business profits
 
01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:42.470 align:start position:0%
that's an Amazon pay business profits
tax

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
yes they would so yeah the business pays
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
and as we move to single sales Factor
 
01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
the percent or the portion of their
 
01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
profits the portion of their profit Pi
 
01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
if you will that gets allocated to New
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is based on the sales that are
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
made into New Hampshire so while the
 
01:31:05.689 --> 01:31:05.699 align:start position:0%
consumer doesn't pay when they purchase
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
something from Amazon they don't pay a
 
01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
sales tax that sale contributes to
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
um the the ratio that we'll use or the
 
01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
fraction that will be used to determine
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
Amazon's profit pie that would be
 
01:31:23.410 --> 01:31:23.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative only
 
01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure how to factor this one
 
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
in but on WE according to the combined
 
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
business chart that you gave us which I
 
01:31:38.689 --> 01:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
find very interesting we have 78
 
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
BPT pla payers above a million dollars
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
but only 16
 
01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.870 align:start position:0%
but only 16
b-e-t

01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
b-e-t
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
which means that most of those are
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
well to have a bet liability you would
 
01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
have to have payroll in the state right
 
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
so they have some amount of of presence
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
here in the state but the you know the
 
01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax is a smaller
 
01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
rate on a different base than the BPT
 
01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
and so when you get to that high dollar
 
01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
amount that greater than a million
 
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
dollar figure
 
01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:22.129 align:start position:0%
dollar figure
um

01:32:22.129 --> 01:32:22.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
bet doesn't bet just doesn't generate as
 
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
much revenue as BPT
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
so there's fewer people in this category
 
01:32:32.689 --> 01:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet
 
01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
just point a clarification we've already
 
01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
voted on 25 correct
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
no we we did vote on 2025 and the the
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
vote count was 11 to 7 and so we do have
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
a majority but I I thought it would be
 
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
helpful to continue discussing I would
 
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
much prefer a stronger majority so that
 
01:32:58.189 --> 01:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
we can all walk out of this room feeling
 
01:32:58.199 --> 01:33:00.470 align:start position:0%
we can all walk out of this room feeling
United

01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
United
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
um so that's why we're continuing the
 
01:33:05.689 --> 01:33:05.699 align:start position:0%
discussion if if you'd like to
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
um I it would be nice if we could get
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere where
 
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
all sides could be more comfortable
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:33:15.649 --> 01:33:15.659 align:start position:0%
so I would just like to add one of the
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
things that I'm I don't know but I have
 
01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
some kind of sense of in my mind are the
 
01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
business sectors that we have in New
 
01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:25.250 align:start position:0%
business sectors that we have in New
Hampshire

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
for example we have a lot that are
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
related to military
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know things that the military buys
 
01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
from us and
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
um you know be the biggest employers
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
like Bae and
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
some of those that that those are not
 
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
going to be negative in negatively
 
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
impacted and I don't think that
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
purchases on Amazon are going to be
 
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted because one of the
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
things we know is that a
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
relatively High portion of our
 
01:34:00.239 --> 01:34:01.970 align:start position:0%
relatively High portion of our
population

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:34:04.370 --> 01:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
has enough income that they're not
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
really feeling a pinch
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the pieces you know
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
which you know I'm trying to put
 
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
together a puzzle and I only have a few
 
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
pieces but those are a few of the pieces
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
that I'm considering uh representative
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up I'm sorry okay
 
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you madam chair
 
01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
um to representative fellows I I guess
 
01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
you're you're correct in the sense that
 
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
people are going to keep buying things
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
but there's already it's already been
 
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
documented that people are
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
kind of so we say downsizing their
 
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
expectations so if they typically would
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
have bought you know
 
01:34:42.649 --> 01:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
um some some good that's valued at
 
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars they're now trying to
 
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
find something that's a little cheaper
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's 17
 
01:34:51.169 --> 01:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
and the one of the things that that I've
 
01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
read recently is that even people making
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand plus are are like Max
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
many of them are maxed out something
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
like 70 65 or 70 percent of them are
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
maxed out and so they also because of
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
inflation are trying to you know
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
downsize in terms of you know they still
 
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
need to buy whatever it is but they're
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
buying the cheaper version of it and so
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
as a whole that's going to bring total
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
gross revenue for even a big company
 
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
like Walmart down a little bit so I
 
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
think you you probably still would there
 
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
is going to be an effect
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative Almy and then we'll go
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
over there on I think the commissioner
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
can answer this question uh the I
 
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
believe the military
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
it's hard to answer that question
 
01:35:53.209 --> 01:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
specifically without because there's
 
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
well there are oodles of military
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
procurement people in this state I will
 
01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
just say to representative fellows point
 
01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
I think I mentioned this in previous
 
01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:04.860 align:start position:0%
discussions as well
 
01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
one thing that New Hampshire has going
 
01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
for it is we have a diverse base of
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
businesses that pay our business profits
 
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
tax and our business Enterprise tax
 
01:36:17.209 --> 01:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why we did see
 
01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
a decline during covid but we didn't see
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
the significant impact that some other
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
states may have you know you can think
 
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
of states that are just solely or not
 
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
solely but a large portion of their
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
revenue comes from tourism
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
or you can think of states that a large
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
portion of their revenue comes from oil
 
01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
and gas and so when you have
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in those sorts of
 
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
Industries their profit their profits
 
01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
are impacted and then the state revenues
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
on their business profits tax are more
 
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
severely impacted we have a more diverse
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
base of businesses that pay our tax so
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
when there are winners and losers in
 
01:36:53.209 --> 01:36:53.219 align:start position:0%
terms of Industries and the impacts that
 
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
the economy is having on those
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
Industries our tax can stay a little bit
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
more stagnant and is a little bit more
 
01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.530 align:start position:0%
more stagnant and is a little bit more
resilient

01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
resilient
 
01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:03.770 align:start position:0%
resilient
representative

01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.250 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
um

01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
given that most people
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
agreed on the 2024 I think it was the
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
vote was 15 to three and
 
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
given that dra was looking at a zero to
 
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
two percent growth
 
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:21.890 align:start position:0%
two percent growth
um

01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
if we take the the average of that and
 
01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
say it's one percent growth we apply the
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
one percent to the 1.2 that most of us
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
agreed on in 2024 we end up with a
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:35.659 align:start position:0%
1.212 we could raise that slightly to
 
01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
1.215 so if if we said 2025 is 1.215
 
01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:44.570 align:start position:0%
1.215 so if if we said 2025 is 1.215
um

01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
well I guess I'll make them I'll make
 
01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:48.050 align:start position:0%
well I guess I'll make them I'll make
1.3

01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
1.3
 
01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:51.410 align:start position:0%
1.3
5

01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.890 --> 01:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
no no we went down to 1.2 basically so
 
01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
I'm basing it on what most of us agreed
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
on for 2024 which is 1.2 one percent
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
yields a 1.212 what I'm saying we can
 
01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:07.139 align:start position:0%
make a little bit higher 1.215
 
01:38:11.930 --> 01:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
so I'll make a motion to to change uh
 
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
is there a second for that
 
01:38:21.050 --> 01:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
anybody want to second that
 
01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:27.260 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a new proposal for FY
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
2025 maybe we can get more consensus
 
01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:31.310 align:start position:0%
2025 maybe we can get more consensus
there

01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh representative Darby I apologize I
 
01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
missed you earlier
 
01:38:37.850 --> 01:38:37.860 align:start position:0%
thank you um Madam chair the only two
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
things I was going to mention
 
01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:42.179 align:start position:0%
um was first you know I'm just speaking
 
01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
um from my own experience my company
 
01:38:46.729 --> 01:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
recently had our uh you know our
 
01:38:49.610 --> 01:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
earnings report for uh 22. and one thing
 
01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
that caught my attention was that
 
01:38:54.169 --> 01:38:54.179 align:start position:0%
um because of the increase in interest
 
01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
rates they're actually making a much
 
01:38:59.629 --> 01:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
much larger profits on their uh existing
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
cash the cash on hand because of the
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
interest rates than they had in the past
 
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
but more more importantly there's two
 
01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
very large
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
um uh what's the word bill is coming out
 
01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:14.209 align:start position:0%
um uh what's the word bill is coming out
of

01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:39:16.129 --> 01:39:16.139 align:start position:0%
um that have already been passed out of
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
Washington the bipartisan infrastructure
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
Act and the inflation reduction act that
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
have only started to
 
01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
um to make their that the money's only
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
started to flow into the states and so I
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
I personally believe that that's going
 
01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
to have an offset to the um to the
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
Slowdown that we're seeing um you know
 
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
Army did you
 
01:39:42.649 --> 01:39:42.659 align:start position:0%
uh no that's
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay so we have a motion it's been
 
01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
seconded other comments on that motion
 
01:39:48.890 --> 01:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ames
 
01:39:51.649 --> 01:39:51.659 align:start position:0%
um just to pick up on that last point
 
01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
which I hadn't been mentioned it's an
 
01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
important Point there's significant
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
Federal money
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
um that already is flowing into the uh
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
our economy here in New Hampshire uh
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
from the previous Federal actions that
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
hasn't been spent yet a huge amount of
 
01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:12.659 align:start position:0%
money there and now we've got these the
 
01:40:14.689 --> 01:40:14.699 align:start position:0%
infrastructure act and I can't remember
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
either either one of these names but uh
 
01:40:20.689 --> 01:40:20.699 align:start position:0%
in any event uh a significant impact
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
there so it's one more reason why I
 
01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
I listened to the to the sort of
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
negatives and to the positives and uh
 
01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
almost throw my hands up I wish I could
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
but I can't and so I uh I come out on
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
the upside I'd be I'd be content to go
 
01:40:38.590 --> 01:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:40:42.890 --> 01:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
proposed uh 1.215 as a con in the
 
01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
interest of compromise
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
and that would be for both
 
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh as I understand it both 24 and 25. no
 
01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:53.219 align:start position:0%
the motion because we had already agreed
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
fairly heavily 15-3 on the 1.2 for 2024
 
01:41:00.649 --> 01:41:00.659 align:start position:0%
so it'd be
 
01:41:04.490 --> 01:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
just for 2025 would go to the 1.215 so
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
you got give me that again okay so what
 
01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
we all agreed on unanimously on 2023 was
 
01:41:15.649 --> 01:41:15.659 align:start position:0%
the 1235 and then on 2024 1.2
 
01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
and then 2025 The Proposal in front of
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
other comments representative Platt
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
Madam chair in the interest of Comedy
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
not comedy committee uh I would go along
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
with the 1.215 but I think we're being
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
overly optimistic I think the economy is
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
going to take a severe recession
 
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you madam chair
 
01:41:44.810 --> 01:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
so yes in the interest of time and
 
01:41:47.209 --> 01:41:47.219 align:start position:0%
everything I would go along with 2.124
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
yes and I agree with rep fellows that
 
01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
you're going to see stronger Walmart
 
01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
sales when the economy declines but it
 
01:41:59.209 --> 01:41:59.219 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean Walmart's going to do
 
01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
better uh number one number two having
 
01:42:04.129 --> 01:42:04.139 align:start position:0%
worked as an auditor with the Department
 
01:42:07.010 --> 01:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
of Defense and on the other side of the
 
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
fence as both a consultant and an
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
insultant I can assure you that the
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
economy will affect the defense industry
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be Rosy I've been
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
through layoffs of 1500 people it's
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
never pretty and so also I I believe
 
01:42:26.689 --> 01:42:26.699 align:start position:0%
that this is more of a rounding error
 
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
than anything so I would go along with
 
01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
two point whatever it is just to be done
 
01:42:33.169 --> 01:42:33.179 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:42:34.609 --> 01:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
well keep in mind with business taxes
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about billion so this is
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
not rounding this is where we're getting
 
01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
you know tens 30 million dollars kind of
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
range so that's why it becomes more
 
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
important for us to go through this to
 
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
see if we can get a comfort level
 
01:42:52.729 --> 01:42:52.739 align:start position:0%
knowing that our crystal ball is very
 
01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
cloudy right now yeah so having having
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
worked with billion dollar contracts I
 
01:42:59.330 --> 01:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
guess in my just from my experience to
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
me it's like it's not a big deal but
 
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
lucky you
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion on the floor
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
um for FY 2025 business taxes for a
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
1.215 all those in favor please raise
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
01:43:21.649 --> 01:43:21.659 align:start position:0%
okay one two three
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
four five six seven eight nine ten
 
01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
eleven twelve thirteen so I'm gonna
 
01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:36.179 align:start position:0%
okay all those opposed raise your hand
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
one two three four five so five okay we
 
01:43:43.370 --> 01:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
are much closer
 
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we're closer because I
 
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
think some of the ones who voted against
 
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
it voted for it in the opposite
 
01:43:58.850 --> 01:43:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
do we try this again or did I get the
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
okay let's try this one more time so now
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
we're just voting on FY 2025
 
01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:15.129 align:start position:0%
we're just voting on FY 2025
for

01:44:15.129 --> 01:44:15.139 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
1.215 all those in favor please raise
 
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
well because someone said I double
 
01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
counted so Mr clerk please count how
 
01:44:27.129 --> 01:44:27.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
six seven
 
01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%

01:44:36.119 --> 01:44:39.770 align:start position:0%
okay all those opposed please raise your
hand

01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.129 --> 01:44:42.139 align:start position:0%
I count three
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
five five three
 
01:44:49.609 --> 01:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
four five sorry okay so we had the
 
01:44:51.649 --> 01:44:51.659 align:start position:0%
number right 13 to 5. thank you very
 
01:44:55.129 --> 01:44:55.139 align:start position:0%
much mixed between parties yes it is
 
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
mixed between parties because obviously
 
01:44:58.850 --> 01:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
we're trying to find a nice Common
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
Ground here
 
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
right and uh we'll get there I think
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty decent majority though
 
01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:08.219 align:start position:0%
we've we've moved in the right direction
 
01:45:08.219 --> 01:45:09.169 align:start position:0%
we've we've moved in the right direction
um

01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:09.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative spillsburg thank you
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair I also noted that the no
 
01:45:17.209 --> 01:45:17.219 align:start position:0%
votes were people who had expressed
 
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:19.860 align:start position:0%
opinions on either side and I'm willing
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
to accept that as a fair median and even
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
though I voted no I'm entirely
 
01:45:26.930 --> 01:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the result
 
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate that okay
 
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
representative so forth
 
01:45:34.129 --> 01:45:34.139 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah I think it's been a
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
really good
 
01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:37.850 align:start position:0%
really good
discussion

01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
drive from Dover and I stayed on the
 
01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:41.709 align:start position:0%
drive from Dover and I stayed on the
road

01:45:41.709 --> 01:45:41.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:44.689 --> 01:45:44.699 align:start position:0%
I think you know the bottom line is what
 
01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
I said earlier recession versus slowdown
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
and I think it's just a perception that
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
people have but um I actually have to
 
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
say I think we came very close so um I I
 
01:45:57.169 --> 01:45:57.179 align:start position:0%
don't have an issue with being one of
 
01:45:59.149 --> 01:45:59.159 align:start position:0%
the no votes
 
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
great thank you represent Almy did you
 
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
want to say something okay okay well
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
let's move on and attack meals and rooms
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Platt Madam chair I
 
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
representative Platt Madam chair I
propose

01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
propose
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 23 306 which is the
 
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
governor's estimate it's within the
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
range of the dra estimates
 
01:46:26.810 --> 01:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
uh 297.6 which is again for 24. again
 
01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimate and split it is
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
the low end of the agency range and
 
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
297.6 for 25 which is also the
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
Governor's estimate is in the low end of
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
the agency range and my concern with
 
01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms
 
01:46:47.689 --> 01:46:47.699 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
is there a second on that
 
01:46:51.169 --> 01:46:51.179 align:start position:0%
oh representative D Simone thank you
 
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead yes my concern with meals
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
and rooms is we might see a little
 
01:46:57.770 --> 01:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
uptick as as vendors raise their prices
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
and it's a percentage of that but I
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
think people are hitting the wall
 
01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
quickly and I I gave a little vignette
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
story again it's not for pun But
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
Domino's thinks their revenues are flat
 
01:47:11.689 --> 01:47:11.699 align:start position:0%
and they think they're flat because
 
01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
people are cooking at home more and
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
you're in that industry I don't know how
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
your sales are doing compared to
 
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
previous years perhaps you could have
 
01:47:20.930 --> 01:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
him some insight but I think it's gonna
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's you know when people were not
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
visiting in covid years they're not
 
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
going to visit again for money reasons
 
01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
as often at least
 
01:47:33.850 --> 01:47:33.860 align:start position:0%
other discussion representative Army
 
01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
sorry year-to-date on rooms and meals
 
01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
has done uh 4.5 percent above last year
 
01:47:46.609 --> 01:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
it doesn't end
 
01:47:46.619 --> 01:47:47.930 align:start position:0%
it doesn't end
um

01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
this month
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
it went oh
 
01:47:53.530 --> 01:47:53.540 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:47:56.450 --> 01:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
21.6 above
 
01:47:58.129 --> 01:47:58.139 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
but that is probably because there
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't much snow until recently
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
and people went out more
 
01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:08.570 align:start position:0%
and people went out more
but

01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:10.790 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
I do think that
 
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
it's going to when people buy in the
 
01:48:19.609 --> 01:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
supermarket they're running into major
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.970 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:29.689 --> 01:48:29.699 align:start position:0%
and it's become
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
something that most people do a lot of
 
01:48:36.530 --> 01:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
is either eating out or picking up and
 
01:48:38.330 --> 01:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
taking it home
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
and if I go to the supermarket
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things I buy is a hot chicken
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
and that has rooms and Mills tax on it
 
01:48:50.330 --> 01:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
because it's hot
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
but it's also juicy at that point and I
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
carve it all up and and make it into
 
01:48:59.930 --> 01:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:03.229 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.290 --> 01:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
yes I know lunch is getting close we've
 
01:49:08.689 --> 01:49:08.699 align:start position:0%
got to try to finish rooms and meals and
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
then we're gonna try to attack real
 
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax and hopefully we can
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
do that no you know and be done with it
 
01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
by 12 30 so that we can take a break and
 
01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
then Chris our lbao assistant can can
 
01:49:26.450 --> 01:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.370 --> 01:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
for sure the numbers that we're talking
 
01:49:30.649 --> 01:49:30.659 align:start position:0%
about that are on the table what's
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the proposal The
 
01:49:39.609 --> 01:49:39.619 align:start position:0%
Proposal is uh for 2023 306 for 2024
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
297.6 for 2025
 
01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
297.6 and basically those are the
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
governor's estimates and are within the
 
01:49:50.890 --> 01:49:50.900 align:start position:0%
range of the dra estimates
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth
 
01:49:57.229 --> 01:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
ah thank you I went with the midpoint of
 
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
the agency estimates again it's just my
 
01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
life experience I think there has been
 
01:50:06.590 --> 01:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
really a permanent change in habits of
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
people going out and it does seem to
 
01:50:09.119 --> 01:50:10.430 align:start position:0%
people going out and it does seem to
affect

01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
affect
 
01:50:12.590 --> 01:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
um all different kinds of businesses the
 
01:50:15.050 --> 01:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
fast food lots of takeout the full
 
01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:16.490 align:start position:0%
fast food lots of takeout the full
service

01:50:16.490 --> 01:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's going to change
 
01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:22.850 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's going to change
short-term

01:50:22.850 --> 01:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
01:50:24.770 --> 01:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
I do think it'll be uneven within the
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
state which I've asked about before
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
I do think the North Country may have
 
01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
trouble with rooms depending on what's
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
happening with the economy but the areas
 
01:50:36.050 --> 01:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
where I spend most of my time which
 
01:50:38.450 --> 01:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
Upper Valley Seacoast the Concord area
 
01:50:41.689 --> 01:50:41.699 align:start position:0%
things are booming and I just don't see
 
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
a major slowdown in those particular
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
areas thank you
 
01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative elberger thank you a
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
quick question I you told us already and
 
01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
I have forgotten and I you can find it
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
faster than I can what is the percentage
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
of the uh meals and rooms tax meals
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
compared to rooms
 
01:51:09.649 --> 01:51:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:13.090 --> 01:51:13.100 align:start position:0%
so I can tell you for last month
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
for Revenue that was collected in
 
01:51:17.810 --> 01:51:17.820 align:start position:0%
February which would have been January
 
01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:20.030 align:start position:0%
February which would have been January
sales

01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
sales
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
rooms are 18.7 percent food is 76.8
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
percent so and is is that maybe not
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
those exact numbers but is that spread
 
01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
relatively consistent that say 80 might
 
01:51:36.169 --> 01:51:36.179 align:start position:0%
be meals and 20 might be rooms when you
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
say spread consistent you mean across
 
01:51:42.850 --> 01:51:42.860 align:start position:0%
the state across time across time uh
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:51.290 --> 01:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
I'll say yeah actually yes the answer is
 
01:51:55.729 --> 01:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
yes for fiscal years 2018 to 2022 on
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
average m r was 17
 
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
rooms 80 meals so yes what we saw last
 
01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
month is generally consistent with the
 
01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
trend we've seen thank you all right so
 
01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
let me just make a couple of comments
 
01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:11.090 align:start position:0%
let me just make a couple of comments
um

01:52:11.090 --> 01:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:13.129 --> 01:52:13.139 align:start position:0%
my husband and I hope to take our first
 
01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
vacation in four years this summer
 
01:52:18.649 --> 01:52:18.659 align:start position:0%
my guess is that many folks have been
 
01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
putting off long vacations for the last
 
01:52:24.649 --> 01:52:24.659 align:start position:0%
few years because of covid because of a
 
01:52:28.129 --> 01:52:28.139 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of issues but I I see what's
 
01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
happening is
 
01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:31.669 align:start position:0%
happening is
that

01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:31.679 --> 01:52:32.930 align:start position:0%
that
people

01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
eat out more partly because they're
 
01:52:37.609 --> 01:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
bored to tears with cooking at home
 
01:52:39.530 --> 01:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh I am
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and also because well maybe they
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
don't have money to go on a vacation but
 
01:52:46.609 --> 01:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
going out to dinner is something they
 
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
can manage when I've gone out regardless
 
01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
of the kind of restaurant they're
 
01:52:53.149 --> 01:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
usually pretty full
 
01:52:53.159 --> 01:52:54.470 align:start position:0%
usually pretty full
and

01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
I don't see especially given that
 
01:53:00.770 --> 01:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
roughly 80 percent of uh m r comes from
 
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
the meals part that we need to worry
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
about underestimating in that area even
 
01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
with potential slowdown I don't think we
 
01:53:11.689 --> 01:53:11.699 align:start position:0%
need to go with the low numbers that
 
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
we're seeing
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
well that on I think it was Monday I
 
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
asked a question about the meals revenue
 
01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
and did it come from the full service
 
01:53:27.890 --> 01:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
restaurants or the you know more like
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
the fast food and the vast majority of
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
it I don't remember the percentage comes
 
01:53:36.169 --> 01:53:36.179 align:start position:0%
from the full service
 
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
restaurants and that tells me that
 
01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
the people who have the money
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
those are the people who have the higher
 
01:53:47.149 --> 01:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
incomes that are spending that money and
 
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
and also tourists and I don't think that
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's going to take a hit I just don't
 
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
and so I'm more comfortable with taking
 
01:53:58.209 --> 01:53:58.219 align:start position:0%
the revenues
 
01:54:00.169 --> 01:54:00.179 align:start position:0%
administration's high and low in
 
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
splitting them
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
I I don't I just don't think I don't see
 
01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did you want to
 
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
weigh in okay
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
represent Alberta did you have more to
 
01:54:18.169 --> 01:54:18.179 align:start position:0%
say sorry no
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh does someone want to
 
01:54:23.930 --> 01:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
give us those numbers of what the
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
midpoint would be between the low and
 
01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
the high so we can think about that okay
 
01:54:28.739 --> 01:54:29.890 align:start position:0%
the high so we can think about that okay
good

01:54:29.890 --> 01:54:29.900 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
316.7 and 325.5
 
01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out how much growth
 
01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
that is yes please thank you okay so
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Almy is going to figure
 
01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
out what kind of percentage growth that
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
is and now going back to what the dra
 
01:54:49.199 --> 01:54:50.870 align:start position:0%
is and now going back to what the dra
said

01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
uh estimated growth range zero to five
 
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
because the dra just tells
 
01:54:58.450 --> 01:54:58.460 align:start position:0%
representative Almy that answer
 
01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
because you know what you're high and
 
01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
low is so what's the midpoint of the the
 
01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
answer midpoint to midpoint is 1.83 yes
 
01:55:07.729 --> 01:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying she can just take
 
01:55:09.290 --> 01:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
her two percents and tell you the
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
in theory yes
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
um I actually
 
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
just want to provide a little bit of
 
01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
clarification on representative plett's
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
motion which was equal to the governor's
 
01:55:24.119 --> 01:55:25.310 align:start position:0%
motion which was equal to the governor's
estimate

01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
the reason why you see a decline from 23
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
to 24 going from the 306 to the
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
297.6 is not actually an assumption that
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
m r revenue is going to go down it is an
 
01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
assumption that m r revenue is flat the
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
reason for the decline is the municipal
 
01:55:50.689 --> 01:55:50.699 align:start position:0%
Revenue transfer because the transfer
 
01:55:53.450 --> 01:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
that occurs in any given year is based
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
so representative plett's motion is
 
01:56:03.169 --> 01:56:03.179 align:start position:0%
actually just a flat
 
01:56:06.169 --> 01:56:06.179 align:start position:0%
it's essentially flat m r gross revenue
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
for all three years the reason for the
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
decline is because of that transfer that
 
01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
transfer is the reason why I can't
 
01:56:16.570 --> 01:56:16.580 align:start position:0%
specifically answer representative
 
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
self-worth's question
 
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
because the
 
01:56:23.930 --> 01:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
basically the the net numbers that
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to estimate Chris and I
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
will work to back into the revenue the
 
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
municipal Revenue transfer
 
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
so that we can get to the actual Revenue
 
01:56:40.129 --> 01:56:40.139 align:start position:0%
in order to determine the growth if that
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
makes sense so clarification go ahead um
 
01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
so clarification
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
um then for now we should just calculate
 
01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
as best we can the midpoint between your
 
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
high and low and you'll back the other
 
01:56:55.729 --> 01:56:55.739 align:start position:0%
in and we'll know the percents later of
 
01:56:57.590 --> 01:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
course in another way you can either do
 
01:57:00.169 --> 01:57:00.179 align:start position:0%
it one of two ways you can either
 
01:57:02.330 --> 01:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
estimate the midpoint
 
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
or you can just
 
01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:06.169 align:start position:0%
or you can just
um

01:57:06.169 --> 01:57:06.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:08.270 --> 01:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
determine the percent growth that you're
 
01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
comfortable with and then during lunch
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
Chris and I can do the math to get you
 
01:57:17.570 --> 01:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
so do we have what your high and low
 
01:57:21.649 --> 01:57:21.659 align:start position:0%
percents were that's what I missed yes
 
01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
we are high and low percent we had a low
 
01:57:27.530 --> 01:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
of zero and a high of five percent so
 
01:57:29.930 --> 01:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
the zero just two and a half so two and
 
01:57:32.089 --> 01:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
a half percent is essentially the
 
01:57:35.089 --> 01:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
midpoint but it may not look like that
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
when you actually do the numbers out
 
01:57:39.490 --> 01:57:39.500 align:start position:0%
once we calculate the transfer
 
01:57:42.169 --> 01:57:42.179 align:start position:0%
if I might jump in just for a second on
 
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:49.250 --> 01:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
you look at rows 9 through 12. that's
 
01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
where you have the m r
 
01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
work so you'll see that row nine was a
 
01:57:56.089 --> 01:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
gross revenue number
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
and from that there's a transfer to
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
meals in the municipal fund and there's
 
01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
a transfer set for school building a
 
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
Debt Service
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
so you can see for 24 there's a range
 
01:58:09.770 --> 01:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
depending on what your starting point is
 
01:58:12.290 --> 01:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
on row nine the transfer is going to be
 
01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
anywhere between 129 8 to 139 million
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then you see the same type of thing
 
01:58:20.570 --> 01:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
for 25. so what Lindsay was the
 
01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner was just saying to you is
 
01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:22.430 align:start position:0%
commissioner was just saying to you is
that

01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:24.410 --> 01:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
because you're providing a net revenue
 
01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
number we're going to have to try to
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
back into what the transfer numbers are
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
unless you come at it from
 
01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
the row 9 schedule if you if you go with
 
01:58:36.050 --> 01:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
the gross number give that that number
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
and then we'll give you what your
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman can I just ask a
 
01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
clarifying question yes please so Chris
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh if if I'm understanding you correctly
 
01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:51.290 align:start position:0%
uh if if I'm understanding you correctly
the

01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
low and high percentage adjustments of
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
zero and five percent have been applied
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
in escalating row nine yes from 23 to 24
 
01:59:04.970 --> 01:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
to 25. and if we were to do quick math
 
01:59:08.330 --> 01:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
on the figures on row 12.
 
01:59:10.250 --> 01:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
we would find that that spread is
 
01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:11.390 align:start position:0%
we would find that that spread is
diminished

01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
diminished
 
01:59:14.570 --> 01:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
because as you go up in Gross you share
 
01:59:19.070 --> 01:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
there was an almond did you wanna
 
01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
say something
 
01:59:24.410 --> 01:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
no okay no at this point I think it's
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
irrelevant that that is numb his numbers
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
come out to 1.1 percent 1.2 percent 1.3
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
percent growth but it makes it's going
 
01:59:37.129 --> 01:59:37.139 align:start position:0%
to look different exactly it's going to
 
01:59:38.930 --> 01:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
look different when so we have to keep
 
01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
that in mind as we go forward what I'm
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
hearing correct me if I'm wrong is that
 
01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
we actually for the first time we have a
 
01:59:46.850 --> 01:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
partisan split we have two different
 
01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:47.870 align:start position:0%
partisan split we have two different
numbers

01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
one that the Republicans have put forth
 
01:59:52.729 --> 01:59:52.739 align:start position:0%
one from the Democrats
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
um on all three of these years
 
01:59:57.830 --> 01:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering
 
02:00:01.850 --> 02:00:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.530 --> 02:00:05.540 align:start position:0%
um so in 2023 we heard 306 versus 311
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
could we come up with the middle number
 
02:00:09.530 --> 02:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
there which would what 3085 something
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:00:12.890 --> 02:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
um and then figure out the split you
 
02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
know so we just come up with the average
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
between our two points of view is that
 
02:00:18.530 --> 02:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
something that we could entertain
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
02:00:22.609 --> 02:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair So based on
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
what I heard and what the commissioner
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
just said and Kristen like you said I've
 
02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
done this before uh I would recommend or
 
02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
just suggest to my esteemed colleagues
 
02:00:36.109 --> 02:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
that we accept the number
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
in 2023
 
02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
and which in this case whether it's 295
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
or 306 I really don't care and then as
 
02:00:47.689 --> 02:00:47.699 align:start position:0%
far as the others I think a split's
 
02:00:51.370 --> 02:00:51.380 align:start position:0%
probably a reasonable thought but 2020
 
02:00:53.570 --> 02:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
2023 is definitely going to be on the
 
02:00:57.649 --> 02:00:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.169 --> 02:01:00.179 align:start position:0%
other comments represent only
 
02:01:05.330 --> 02:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:07.729 --> 02:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
but I'm I mean we
 
02:01:10.010 --> 02:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
we've got people
 
02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of little restaurants
 
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.410 --> 02:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
uh the representative plett you made the
 
02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
original motion would you be willing to
 
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
amend that motion as soon as I have the
 
02:01:28.330 --> 02:01:28.340 align:start position:0%
numbers I will okay let's pause and
 
02:01:31.310 --> 02:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to say something okay
 
02:01:32.930 --> 02:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
we'll pause for just a moment you guys
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
can look at your numbers
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
I thought I said yes I wonder again if
 
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
it might make sense just I think it'll
 
02:01:44.089 --> 02:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
be easier to just do it in three
 
02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where we are
 
02:01:56.089 --> 02:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
so I did so we're going to make a
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
revised motion
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
um because it seems like we have a
 
02:02:01.729 --> 02:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
partisan divide on this particular topic
 
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
and so we have two different numbers
 
02:02:05.089 --> 02:02:05.099 align:start position:0%
that we're kind of leaning toward and so
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
what representative plett is looking at
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
is kind of trying to come up with a
 
02:02:11.930 --> 02:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
compromise and he's going to amend his
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
motion with a new number that reflects
 
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
both sides so I thought that we were
 
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
going to wait for um
 
02:02:22.010 --> 02:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
are for Chris and
 
02:02:23.689 --> 02:02:23.699 align:start position:0%
um no they'll have to do their
 
02:02:25.729 --> 02:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
adjustment based off of whatever number
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
we come up with yeah I think that's what
 
02:02:31.609 --> 02:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
we need to do representative Ami
 
02:02:34.609 --> 02:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
yes I think it makes more sense to give
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
two or three different percentages to
 
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
them and have them bring them back
 
02:02:43.250 --> 02:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
because the percentages that we're
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
looking at here don't work
 
02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
on with looking at what the growth is or
 
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
non-growth is in the industry
 
02:02:56.750 --> 02:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
but if we tell if we go back to page
 
02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:06.890 align:start position:0%
but if we tell if we go back to page
three

02:03:06.890 --> 02:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:08.330 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
pick say it right
 
02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
one percent two percent three percent
 
02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:17.450 align:start position:0%
one percent two percent three percent
growth

02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative Sanborn if I might if the
 
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
committee could give
 
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
a number for 23 a gross number and then
 
02:03:26.450 --> 02:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
what you want to grow it by percentage
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
in 24 and 25 that's a fairly easy
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
calculation that we can put together for
 
02:03:31.199 --> 02:03:32.450 align:start position:0%
calculation that we can put together for
you

02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
if you give us a net revenue number it's
 
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
going to be a little bit more involved
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
in trying to get back up to the gross
 
02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
number than figure that all out
 
02:03:45.709 --> 02:03:45.719 align:start position:0%
and if I may if you give a net number
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
for 20
 
02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:49.669 align:start position:0%
for 20
four

02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
it may actually end up being wrong
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
because the municipal Revenue transfer
 
02:03:57.169 --> 02:03:57.179 align:start position:0%
is going to be based on the 23 amount so
 
02:03:59.390 --> 02:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
even if you give us a number we're going
 
02:04:02.570 --> 02:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
to have to modify it so to Chris's point
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
it might make sense to decide on a 23
 
02:04:07.550 --> 02:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
number and then a growth for 24 and 25
 
02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
we'll do the math and can come back and
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
you can approve the actual numbers
 
02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
okay representative plett Madam chair I
 
02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
withdraw my previous Motion in its
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
entirety and I will make a new motion
 
02:04:25.129 --> 02:04:25.139 align:start position:0%
for FY 23 a 308.5
 
02:04:26.689 --> 02:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
which is a split of the difference
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
between the 306 that was suggested in
 
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
the 311 of midpoint
 
02:04:34.490 --> 02:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
308.5 that is uh higher than the
 
02:04:36.050 --> 02:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
governor's estimate so it's clearly
 
02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
within the rage
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury okay so now we
 
02:04:46.010 --> 02:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
have that motion and we've discussed
 
02:04:47.629 --> 02:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
this one at lengths we'll just focus on
 
02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
that all those in favor of the 308.5 for
 
02:04:58.729 --> 02:04:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:01.490 --> 02:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
okay let's do a count with me one two
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
three four five six seven eight nine ten
 
02:05:08.209 --> 02:05:08.219 align:start position:0%
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen I got
 
02:05:08.219 --> 02:05:17.149 align:start position:0%
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen I got
14.

02:05:17.149 --> 02:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:19.209 --> 02:05:19.219 align:start position:0%
and all those opposed
 
02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:26.169 --> 02:05:26.179 align:start position:0%
one to
 
02:05:29.330 --> 02:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
you're switching
 
02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:35.930 align:start position:0%
you're switching
okay

02:05:35.930 --> 02:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.609 --> 02:05:37.619 align:start position:0%
well we were dealing with the motion
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
that was giving us which is on page four
 
02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
and based on the recommendations of the
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
lbao and
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
dra we are first voting on
 
02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:51.229 align:start position:0%
dra we are first voting on
2023

02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
2023
 
02:05:51.239 --> 02:05:53.149 align:start position:0%
2023
so

02:05:53.149 --> 02:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:56.030 --> 02:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
depending on which time we either had a
 
02:06:02.570 --> 02:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
14 to 4 or 13 to 5 on the 3085 for 2023
 
02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:04.250 align:start position:0%
14 to 4 or 13 to 5 on the 3085 for 2023
okay

02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
right that we got okay so now that we
 
02:06:12.589 --> 02:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.599 --> 02:06:14.109 align:start position:0%
 
calculated

02:06:14.109 --> 02:06:14.119 align:start position:0%
calculated
 
02:06:17.689 --> 02:06:17.699 align:start position:0%
not for 2023
 
02:06:19.550 --> 02:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's right we know the municipal
 
02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
Revenue transfer um total amount for 23
 
02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
because it was based on 22 revenues so
 
02:06:29.149 --> 02:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
we're fine with 23 that whatever number
 
02:06:31.729 --> 02:06:31.739 align:start position:0%
you agree on will work the problem is
 
02:06:34.729 --> 02:06:34.739 align:start position:0%
when we get to 24
 
02:06:36.890 --> 02:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
that is going to be based on the amount
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
for 23 and 25 is going to be amazed
 
02:06:42.290 --> 02:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
based on the amount for 24. so her
 
02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion was to you know kind of draw
 
02:06:47.149 --> 02:06:47.159 align:start position:0%
a line in the sand on 2023 so then that
 
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
math works and then from there if we
 
02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
want to talk about well what do we do we
 
02:06:54.669 --> 02:06:54.679 align:start position:0%
think there'll be a percentage increase
 
02:06:59.330 --> 02:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
in 2024 and if so what their estimated
 
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
growth rate was zero to five percent so
 
02:07:04.270 --> 02:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
where do we want to be on that
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so I know you're going to run
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
several numbers I'd like to see 2.5 for
 
02:07:15.229 --> 02:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.450 --> 02:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you as a percentage of growth
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
increase okay other comments on that
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury it's a
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
corresponding request that we see Zero
 
02:07:34.189 --> 02:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative jinnegan
 
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I guess
 
02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:39.290 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I guess
um

02:07:39.290 --> 02:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
my question to those
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
who who would say it's going to grow you
 
02:07:45.599 --> 02:07:46.609 align:start position:0%
who who would say it's going to grow you
know

02:07:46.609 --> 02:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
let's say two and a half percent if
 
02:07:52.850 --> 02:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
we're if on the business taxes side we
 
02:07:55.490 --> 02:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
said we're down almost three percent
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
um in the next year and then we are flat
 
02:08:01.490 --> 02:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
it seems like m r is going to
 
02:08:04.010 --> 02:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
not not perfectly reflect that but you
 
02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
know in some respects go with that so I
 
02:08:08.089 --> 02:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
guess I would be
 
02:08:11.330 --> 02:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
I I would struggle as to why m r would
 
02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
grow two and a half percent each year
 
02:08:16.729 --> 02:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
but by business profits would go down so
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
I think we we need so my my thought is
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
that that m r
 
02:08:24.970 --> 02:08:24.980 align:start position:0%
um would probably at best case be flat
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
from 2023 to 2024 and then to 2025 then
 
02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a slight growth
 
02:08:36.410 --> 02:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis so I would just
 
02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
say the answer that question is because
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think that business taxes will
 
02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
be going down that much so
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
the higher amount for room and meals
 
02:08:50.330 --> 02:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
keeps me kind of with the same Outlook
 
02:08:52.089 --> 02:08:52.099 align:start position:0%
that I have
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative follow me
 
02:08:58.129 --> 02:08:58.139 align:start position:0%
and speaking is one who thought that the
 
02:08:59.810 --> 02:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
business taxes would go down that much
 
02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:01.490 align:start position:0%
business taxes would go down that much
on

02:09:01.490 --> 02:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:09:06.669 --> 02:09:06.679 align:start position:0%
there has only been one year since
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
2008 when we put or nine when we put in
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:09:17.629 --> 02:09:17.639 align:start position:0%
extra money for the uh
 
02:09:20.209 --> 02:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
the tourism
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
public publicity that we have actually
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
and all the rest of the time it has been
 
02:09:32.510 --> 02:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
going up
 
02:09:34.729 --> 02:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
I think it started after it lost ground
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
it went back to three percent and then
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
it and it's been five percent most years
 
02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:41.330 align:start position:0%
it and it's been five percent most years
so

02:09:41.330 --> 02:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.649 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:09:42.649 --> 02:09:42.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:46.729 --> 02:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard unless we run into a
 
02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
major major food
 
02:09:53.629 --> 02:09:53.639 align:start position:0%
crisis again that is lack of lack of
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
wheat lack of corn lack of lack of meat
 
02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:59.089 align:start position:0%
wheat lack of corn lack of lack of meat
then

02:09:59.089 --> 02:09:59.099 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:09:59.099 --> 02:10:00.470 align:start position:0%
then
then

02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
I think there's going to be growth we're
 
02:10:04.490 --> 02:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
talking about consumers rather than
 
02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
corporations when we're talking about
 
02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:09.470 align:start position:0%
corporations when we're talking about
this

02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:12.169 --> 02:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
and representatively ones from inside of
 
02:10:14.330 --> 02:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire representative orrs I'm
 
02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:16.310 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire representative orrs I'm
sorry

02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:10:19.070 --> 02:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so my question to
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
you is in if we were to go back and look
 
02:10:26.169 --> 02:10:26.179 align:start position:0%
at 2005 6789 before the coven
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
2015 16 17 18 before the covid
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
what was the annual increase do you have
 
02:10:41.149 --> 02:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
I do I'm gonna guess that we get right
 
02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
around five percent my recollection is
 
02:10:49.370 --> 02:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
that pre-covered years m r increased on
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
average about five percent which is how
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
we got to that high of 5 so
 
02:10:55.800 --> 02:11:01.790 align:start position:0%
we got to that high of 5 so
um

02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:04.970 --> 02:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
fya 17 over 16 was four and a half
 
02:11:09.169 --> 02:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
percent FY 18 over 17 was 5.4 percent FY
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
19 over 18 was 5.6 percent then we saw a
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
decline in FY 20 over 19 of 6.6 percent
 
02:11:19.010 --> 02:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
because we had the the shutdown in the
 
02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:19.910 align:start position:0%
because we had the the shutdown in the
economy

02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
economy
 
02:11:22.129 --> 02:11:22.139 align:start position:0%
okay thank you follow-up question please
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
so if we were to go back and look at
 
02:11:33.770 --> 02:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:41.450 --> 02:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
I'm the one who got the publicity money
 
02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:46.189 align:start position:0%
I'm the one who got the publicity money
and

02:11:46.189 --> 02:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
2007 to 2008 we grew 3.4 percent 2008 to
 
02:11:53.570 --> 02:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
2009 we declined two percent 2009 to
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
2010 we grew 9.2 percent
 
02:11:59.930 --> 02:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
so from ready for this
 
02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:01.270 align:start position:0%
so from ready for this
from

02:12:01.270 --> 02:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
1973 State fiscal year 1973
 
02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:06.169 align:start position:0%
1973 State fiscal year 1973
till

02:12:06.169 --> 02:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
till
 
02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 2022
 
02:12:13.609 --> 02:12:13.619 align:start position:0%
m r year-over-year change only declined
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
four times once from 74 to 75
 
02:12:22.070 --> 02:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
second time from 84 to 85
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
third time from 2008 to 2009
 
02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
fourth time from 2019 to 2020.
 
02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
very good so I think my point is that
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
she confirms what I'm thinking is that
 
02:12:39.290 --> 02:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a hit in 2023 and
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
then 2024 and 5 I think it's going to be
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
a little Rosier just one man's opinion
 
02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
thanks um uh a couple of quick points I
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
2008 was a dramatic um you know it's
 
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
called the Great Recession as opposed to
 
02:12:59.089 --> 02:12:59.099 align:start position:0%
you know 2001 2002 which was
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
um even a very significant uh uh
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
recession but not nothing like 2008. so
 
02:13:06.649 --> 02:13:06.659 align:start position:0%
that seems a little
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
closer in in likelihood although I think
 
02:13:12.410 --> 02:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
that's I'd be surprised if we hit that
 
02:13:14.930 --> 02:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
hard but my real point was that we've
 
02:13:17.209 --> 02:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
actually seen a growth in population for
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
the last four years in New Hampshire in
 
02:13:20.689 --> 02:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
fact the the largest growth in New
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
England last year
 
02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
um while it's you know while it's a
 
02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
fraction of a percentage it it does
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
contribute to those that are going to be
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
going out and secondly that inflation
 
02:13:36.770 --> 02:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
does directly affect the rooms and meals
 
02:13:38.689 --> 02:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
taxed as well and we just had a long
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
um about inflation how inflation is
 
02:13:43.609 --> 02:13:43.619 align:start position:0%
going to continue to hit us over the
 
02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
next three years
 
02:13:48.129 --> 02:13:48.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:51.770 --> 02:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
did you have something no okay uh
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
representative Madam chair I just want
 
02:13:55.970 --> 02:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
to understand where we are we voted on
 
02:13:59.689 --> 02:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
uh FY 23 are we waiting for calculations
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
before we tackle 24 and 20. no we are
 
02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
now what we're trying to come up with is
 
02:14:07.729 --> 02:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
what we believe the increased percentage
 
02:14:10.930 --> 02:14:10.940 align:start position:0%
or decrease percentage would be from
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
2023 we've heard 2.5 uh from one member
 
02:14:19.089 --> 02:14:19.099 align:start position:0%
as uh his comfort level for both years
 
02:14:21.649 --> 02:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
and we're discussing that out because
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's hard for us to give an exact number
 
02:14:28.250 --> 02:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
a percentage is easier for uh lbao to
 
02:14:30.530 --> 02:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
calculate because net of the transfers
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to come up with a mo I'd
 
02:14:34.850 --> 02:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
like to hear a motion that would appease
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
everyone on a percentage increase from
 
02:14:39.550 --> 02:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
the 2023 level
 
02:14:41.689 --> 02:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet has this yeah I
 
02:14:43.609 --> 02:14:43.619 align:start position:0%
just want to offer some perspective here
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
I think in hearing some of the testimony
 
02:14:48.410 --> 02:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
I think we can all acknowledge you know
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
I was just talking to my colleague to my
 
02:14:53.089 --> 02:14:53.099 align:start position:0%
right that the kitchen table model that
 
02:14:55.490 --> 02:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
we've all been used to for a lot of
 
02:14:58.370 --> 02:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
years was uh sitting around the family
 
02:15:01.010 --> 02:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
kitchen making dinner I I believe that
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
many more of us are going out and
 
02:15:05.149 --> 02:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
getting takeout whether it's eating out
 
02:15:08.569 --> 02:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
take out for for whatever reason
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
um and I think that we're going to see
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
an incremental
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
although small I'd rather see it very
 
02:15:18.890 --> 02:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
flat growth because people are
 
02:15:20.689 --> 02:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
accustomed to that now we're probably
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with a different model as far as
 
02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
the family dinner or the family lunch or
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
sending kids out the door
 
02:15:30.410 --> 02:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
um but I think we should be a little
 
02:15:33.229 --> 02:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
more hawkish than 2.5 percent although I
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
agree you know my personal opinion would
 
02:15:39.169 --> 02:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
be to keep it flat but uh I I
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
acknowledge and if we go with the you
 
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
know with the 308.5 that we have if we
 
02:15:46.490 --> 02:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
stay flat in my opinion that's the best
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
and that's acknowledging the growth I
 
02:15:51.050 --> 02:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
think so I don't think anybody's
 
02:15:52.430 --> 02:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
thinking we're going to go down three
 
02:15:54.050 --> 02:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
percent I don't think that's the case
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
but I think we do have a different model
 
02:15:57.470 --> 02:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
and we have to acknowledge that but
 
02:16:00.050 --> 02:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
let's be reserved in that
 
02:16:07.970 --> 02:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:09.169 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:16:09.169 --> 02:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:11.330 --> 02:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
um listening to what everyone is saying
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
we've got some obviously some different
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
perspectives and I would propose that we
 
02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
try to split the difference here as best
 
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
we can and I would offer that we do a
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
1.5 percent increase
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
um year over year
 
02:16:28.189 --> 02:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
would that be for both years or just for
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
22 to 24 23 to 24. are you talking about
 
02:16:35.570 --> 02:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
both years that would be
 
02:16:37.849 --> 02:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
both years since I believe the previous
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
thought process was 2.5 percent
 
02:16:44.270 --> 02:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh year over year for both years
 
02:16:47.629 --> 02:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion uh is to recommend a
 
02:16:50.330 --> 02:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
1.5 percent increase
 
02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
from the 2023 number we agreed upon for
 
02:16:55.969 --> 02:16:55.979 align:start position:0%
2024 and then another 1.5 percent
 
02:16:59.750 --> 02:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
increase on that for 2025. is there a
 
02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:01.310 align:start position:0%
increase on that for 2025. is there a
second

02:17:01.310 --> 02:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:17:03.610 --> 02:17:03.620 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
02:17:08.209 --> 02:17:08.219 align:start position:0%
okay uh clarification yep clarification
 
02:17:10.490 --> 02:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
um apply it against what the percent is
 
02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
going to be applied against
 
02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
the against 308.5
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
which is No it should be the higher
 
02:17:21.709 --> 02:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
number shouldn't it and then you
 
02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
go right help us out so right so what
 
02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
we'll do is we'll take the 308.5 being
 
02:17:30.290 --> 02:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
the estimate of the net revenue for 23
 
02:17:32.690 --> 02:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
We'll add back the municipal Revenue
 
02:17:34.310 --> 02:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
transfer We'll add back the school
 
02:17:37.190 --> 02:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
building Aid will then gross it up by
 
02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
the percent in this case or in this
 
02:17:40.849 --> 02:17:40.859 align:start position:0%
option the one and a half percent will
 
02:17:42.410 --> 02:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
take out the new school building Aid
 
02:17:44.330 --> 02:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
we'll take out the new Municipal
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
transfer to give you a net number and
 
02:17:50.089 --> 02:17:50.099 align:start position:0%
we'll repeat that same procedure
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
um for 25 and just for clarification the
 
02:17:55.310 --> 02:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
reason for doing that is
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
the municipal Revenue transfer and the
 
02:17:59.150 --> 02:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
school building Aid is revenue that was
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
collected it just gets put in a place
 
02:18:03.770 --> 02:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
that's restricted
 
02:18:05.089 --> 02:18:05.099 align:start position:0%
um and does not flow into the general
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
fund so you need a general fund number
 
02:18:09.770 --> 02:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
for your Revenue estimating purposes but
 
02:18:11.450 --> 02:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
the revenue is still collected so we
 
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we account for that
 
02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
when we do grow the revenue so this is
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
why we need them to do their numbers and
 
02:18:18.950 --> 02:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
why we're talking about a percentage
 
02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
right now so that makes perfect sense
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:32.810 --> 02:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add Point 1.5 for 24 and 2.5
 
02:18:35.629 --> 02:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
for 25 I think both of these numbers are
 
02:18:39.169 --> 02:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
probably too low by the way but on
 
02:18:42.770 --> 02:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
there we're likely to be coming out of
 
02:18:46.310 --> 02:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
whatever we're stuck with by 25.
 
02:18:49.370 --> 02:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
and the track record of males and rooms
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
certainly just
 
02:18:54.049 --> 02:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
is more than that by a lot
 
02:18:57.530 --> 02:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
other comments before we take a vote on
 
02:18:59.810 --> 02:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
the current motion yes representative so
 
02:19:02.270 --> 02:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
just so to be sure everyone follows it
 
02:19:06.530 --> 02:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
right 1.5 up in 24 augmented by a
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
further 1.5 and 25.
 
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:21.530 --> 02:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
do we have a motion or yes yep that was
 
02:19:24.290 --> 02:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
a motion and it was seconded uh it was
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
made by representative janigan and
 
02:19:28.969 --> 02:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative soti on
 
02:19:30.290 --> 02:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
using our Base number that we already
 
02:19:32.089 --> 02:19:32.099 align:start position:0%
agreed upon and then adding a 1.5
 
02:19:35.209 --> 02:19:35.219 align:start position:0%
percent adding another 1.5 percent the
 
02:19:37.310 --> 02:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
next year and letting them do their
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
magic with spreadsheets
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
so we get to the right net transfer to
 
02:19:47.929 --> 02:19:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
the end
 
02:19:53.090 --> 02:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
of it yes it got confused I thought they
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
said they'd do several scenarios and so
 
02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
I thought we could give them like three
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
different percents they'd get them all
 
02:20:02.810 --> 02:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
done and then afterwards we'll we know
 
02:20:04.370 --> 02:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
what we were working with
 
02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
but I may have misunderstood oh well but
 
02:20:08.330 --> 02:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
it's going to take them a little time to
 
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
come back and do that so I don't know
 
02:20:12.650 --> 02:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
how long you want to wait for them to do
 
02:20:14.570 --> 02:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
that that's the only thing I thought it
 
02:20:17.389 --> 02:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
was quick for them to do 1.52 years in a
 
02:20:17.399 --> 02:20:18.969 align:start position:0%
was quick for them to do 1.52 years in a
row

02:20:18.969 --> 02:20:18.979 align:start position:0%
row
 
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
so if we said 1.5 if we agreed to this
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
is that something you could tell us the
 
02:20:26.510 --> 02:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
numbers right now or do we need to take
 
02:20:28.190 --> 02:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
a break and come back it'll take a few
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
minutes okay so Madam chair
 
02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative fellows I I don't even
 
02:20:35.430 --> 02:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
know where we are so I understand
 
02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
know where we are so I understand
[Music]

02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.010 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
an additional The Proposal which I not
 
02:20:42.650 --> 02:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
really don't agree with I think it's too
 
02:20:45.490 --> 02:20:45.500 align:start position:0%
low but the proposal for for
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
2024 is to add 1.5 percent and for 25
 
02:20:52.849 --> 02:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
add 1.2 percent the thing that I'm lost
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
on is
 
02:20:58.210 --> 02:20:58.220 align:start position:0%
are we giving them a number
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
423 or we already gave them the number
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
for 2023 we voted on that part okay and
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
that gives them a good base to then
 
02:21:10.730 --> 02:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
figure that 0.5 yes okay yes so yeah so
 
02:21:13.130 --> 02:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
that's what we already did
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
um how about this why don't we take a 10
 
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
minute stretch break
 
02:21:19.849 --> 02:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
uh after we let's take a vote on this
 
02:21:22.130 --> 02:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
because we have a motion before us and
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
then see where that lands and then like
 
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
take a 10 minute stretch break come back
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and see where we are and we still
 
02:21:29.809 --> 02:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
have to deal with the real estate
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
transfer taxes
 
02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
before we can take a lunch break so I
 
02:21:35.929 --> 02:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
put just take a 10 minute stretch break
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay but we have a motion before us
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
the motion that was made was to
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
take use because we've heard multiple
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
things we had one recommendation of a
 
02:21:48.170 --> 02:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
2.5 percent increase in the spirit of
 
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
compromise a 1.5 percent increase was
 
02:21:53.150 --> 02:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
put forth
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative horse thank you madam
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
chair so I like rep alme's idea about
 
02:22:02.210 --> 02:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
2.5 and 25 with a slight adjustment I'm
 
02:22:03.889 --> 02:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
not sure who mentioned it down here one
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
of my esteemed colleagues mentioned 1.5
 
02:22:08.030 --> 02:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
also in 2025.
 
02:22:10.670 --> 02:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh just to help this committee out I'd
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
say you know let's go one five in 2024
 
02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
and split the difference at 2.0 and 2025
 
02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
just as a thought thank you
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to amend
 
02:22:32.330 --> 02:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:34.969 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:22:34.969 --> 02:22:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:37.610 --> 02:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
I will amend my motion to be a 1.5
 
02:22:41.150 --> 02:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
percent increase from 2023 to 2024 and a
 
02:22:44.510 --> 02:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
2.0 increase from 20 from that number in
 
02:22:50.210 --> 02:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:56.809 --> 02:22:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
right so 1.5 2024 and then 2.0 2025. do
 
02:23:05.230 --> 02:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
we have a second for the amended motion
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
well you made the suggestion would you
 
02:23:09.170 --> 02:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
like to second that okay seconded by
 
02:23:12.290 --> 02:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
representative orrs okay
 
02:23:14.030 --> 02:23:14.040 align:start position:0%

02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's 1.5 increase and then a two percent
 
02:23:19.010 --> 02:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
increase all those in favor raise your
 
02:23:19.020 --> 02:23:20.570 align:start position:0%
increase all those in favor raise your

02:23:27.650 --> 02:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
eight nine
 
02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
ten eleven so that's eleven
 
02:23:33.950 --> 02:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
and all those opposed
 
02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:35.870 align:start position:0%
and all those opposed
one

02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
two three four five eleven to five does
 
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
take them out to seven against we just
 
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
need to count again yeah okay all those
 
02:23:55.250 --> 02:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
who are opposed raise your hand because
 
02:23:59.090 --> 02:23:59.100 align:start position:0%

02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't know how I'm missing
 
02:24:11.389 --> 02:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
hands here so did everyone vote let's go
 
02:24:12.889 --> 02:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
back to a house session all those who
 
02:24:14.090 --> 02:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
were present what
 
02:24:17.450 --> 02:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
yourself I did
 
02:24:17.460 --> 02:24:19.010 align:start position:0%
yourself I did
okay

02:24:19.010 --> 02:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:24:22.010 --> 02:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
all those in favor raise your hand
 
02:24:25.010 --> 02:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
no Mr would fight where's the clerk
 
02:24:27.469 --> 02:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
please count
 
02:24:27.479 --> 02:24:32.950 align:start position:0%
please count
today

02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
okay so so one of the challenges we have
 
02:24:38.889 --> 02:24:38.899 align:start position:0%
folks changing their mind so that's
 
02:24:41.809 --> 02:24:41.819 align:start position:0%
interesting so then all those opposed
 
02:24:52.809 --> 02:24:52.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:55.730 --> 02:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
okay so let's take a little break right
 
02:24:57.650 --> 02:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
now stretch out a little bit I know you
 
02:24:59.450 --> 02:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
guys been working really really hard and
 
02:25:03.170 --> 02:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
we'll come back at uh 12 35 and go back
 
02:25:05.330 --> 02:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
to this and try to do
 
02:25:08.990 --> 02:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
I thought
 
02:25:15.490 --> 02:25:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
did you give up on the lunch break
 
02:25:23.450 --> 02:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
one more article that you want
 
02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:32.330 align:start position:0%
one more article that you want
foreign

02:25:32.330 --> 02:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
she hasn't mentioned is that
 
02:25:38.349 --> 02:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
the Communications tech to real estate
 
02:25:41.330 --> 02:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
well yes but she wants where's the lunch
 
02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:42.290 align:start position:0%
well yes but she wants where's the lunch
break

02:25:42.290 --> 02:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
break
 
02:25:44.929 --> 02:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
after we do real estate transfers and
 
02:25:46.490 --> 02:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's the only thing that's left is
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
Communications that
 
02:25:58.809 --> 02:25:58.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
we skip lunch that's fine with me I'll
 
02:26:33.650 --> 02:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:44.770 --> 02:26:44.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:52.130 --> 02:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:59.630 --> 02:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:25.309 --> 02:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:25.319 --> 02:27:40.309 align:start position:0%
 
Robin

02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:49.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:27:49.429 --> 02:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:49.439 --> 02:46:08.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:46:08.990 --> 02:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:11.690 --> 02:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
room chair after we get the numbers from
 
02:46:13.429 --> 02:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
Chris and the Dr Ray could we chew on
 
02:46:17.290 --> 02:46:17.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:20.210 --> 02:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
yes just to revisit where we are today
 
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
so once we get rooms and meals done
 
02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
and we get Highway and real estate
 
02:46:29.750 --> 02:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
transfer text on we will then take a
 
02:46:32.809 --> 02:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
solid one-hour lunch break
 
02:46:35.389 --> 02:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
poor crochet will not take a lunch break
 
02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
because he's going to be putting all
 
02:46:39.110 --> 02:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
these numbers in a spreadsheet and then
 
02:46:42.170 --> 02:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
we will come back and review them to
 
02:46:44.210 --> 02:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
make sure they're accurate and then vote
 
02:46:44.220 --> 02:46:45.770 align:start position:0%
make sure they're accurate and then vote
on

02:46:45.770 --> 02:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:46:47.570 --> 02:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
hopefully he gets a snack or I'll go
 
02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
order lunch right now and we'll get it
 
02:46:54.349 --> 02:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
to happen Okay so we are still on rooms
 
02:46:55.849 --> 02:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
and meals we've taken a number of
 
02:46:58.490 --> 02:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
different votes and we're still a little
 
02:47:00.530 --> 02:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
bit apart I'd love to see us a little
 
02:47:02.270 --> 02:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
bit more together on that representative
 
02:47:04.429 --> 02:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
janigan do you have any thoughts
 
02:47:06.469 --> 02:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
I do thank you madam chair
 
02:47:06.479 --> 02:47:09.230 align:start position:0%
I do thank you madam chair
after

02:47:09.230 --> 02:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
after
 
02:47:11.389 --> 02:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
talking to people some more and trying
 
02:47:15.050 --> 02:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
to come to a a further consensus the the
 
02:47:17.150 --> 02:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
last vote um
 
02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
favoring our our 1.5 and 2.0 but in an
 
02:47:24.110 --> 02:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
effort to get a little more consensus I
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
would like to make a motion that year
 
02:47:30.469 --> 02:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
over year from 2023 to 2024 we we stay
 
02:47:32.809 --> 02:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
with that same 1.5 percent increase but
 
02:47:38.090 --> 02:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
from 24 to 25 we raise that to 2.5 so it
 
02:47:40.130 --> 02:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
would be 1.5 percent and then 2.5
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
percent and um
 
02:47:46.610 --> 02:47:46.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully we get further consensus is
 
02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
02:47:51.230 --> 02:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
oh representative Southwest second set
 
02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
okay we've had a lot of discussions so
 
02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
why don't we just take a vote to see if
 
02:47:56.990 --> 02:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
that helps us move the needle to a
 
02:47:58.849 --> 02:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
little bit better consensus unless did
 
02:48:00.410 --> 02:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
you have a comment representative moment
 
02:48:03.830 --> 02:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay great all those in favor of
 
02:48:06.650 --> 02:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
janigan's motion of 1.5 percent increase
 
02:48:10.670 --> 02:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
in 2024 2.5 percent increase in 2025
 
02:48:14.330 --> 02:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:19.070 --> 02:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six
 
02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
and ten eleven eleven six excellent so
 
02:48:24.410 --> 02:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
we both counted 16 all those opposed
 
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:27.950 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
one

02:48:27.950 --> 02:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
did we lose someone
 
02:48:33.290 --> 02:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
oh we lost someone okay
 
02:48:35.270 --> 02:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay so that's it feels like a better
 
02:48:37.010 --> 02:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
consensus to me thank you so much
 
02:48:39.050 --> 02:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
everyone I really appreciate it it is
 
02:48:40.969 --> 02:48:40.979 align:start position:0%
tough on these things because we all
 
02:48:42.889 --> 02:48:42.899 align:start position:0%
represent different parts of the state
 
02:48:44.389 --> 02:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
with a little bit different perspective
 
02:48:46.490 --> 02:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
on things could you just give us the
 
02:48:48.710 --> 02:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
numbers not just the percent but the
 
02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
numbers for those teams that's why yeah
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
we have to do this one differently I
 
02:48:56.690 --> 02:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
apologize but now he can plug in numbers
 
02:48:58.849 --> 02:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
along with the commissioner and we'll
 
02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
get the the final numbers and then we'll
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
have all that to look back at and vote
 
02:49:07.010 --> 02:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
on later okay so now we will go to
 
02:49:09.230 --> 02:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
the tough one
 
02:49:11.150 --> 02:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer taxes maybe it's
 
02:49:12.950 --> 02:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
tough maybe it's not maybe we'll be all
 
02:49:14.650 --> 02:49:14.660 align:start position:0%
on the same wavelength on that
 
02:49:17.929 --> 02:49:17.939 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
02:49:19.610 --> 02:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:49:19.620 --> 02:49:20.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

02:49:20.990 --> 02:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:24.889 --> 02:49:24.899 align:start position:0%
I'm proposing I'd like to make a motion
 
02:49:27.770 --> 02:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
fat for 2023
 
02:49:30.110 --> 02:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
we take the midpoint of the agency's
 
02:49:36.830 --> 02:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:40.510 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:49:40.510 --> 02:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:44.809 --> 02:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:48.230 --> 02:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
for FY 24
 
02:49:57.889 --> 02:49:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:57.899 --> 02:49:59.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:49:59.870 --> 02:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:02.090 align:start position:0%
and
425

02:50:02.090 --> 02:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
425
 
02:50:05.929 --> 02:50:05.939 align:start position:0%
a slight further reduction to 211.
 
02:50:08.510 --> 02:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
and when I
 
02:50:09.950 --> 02:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
will speak to that when you give me the
 
02:50:11.809 --> 02:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
opportunity absolutely so we have a
 
02:50:16.370 --> 02:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:18.410 --> 02:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
okay representative Platt seconds that
 
02:50:20.389 --> 02:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
and yes representative spilsbury if you
 
02:50:21.889 --> 02:50:21.899 align:start position:0%
could explain how you got to those
 
02:50:21.899 --> 02:50:23.090 align:start position:0%
could explain how you got to those
numbers

02:50:23.090 --> 02:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:50:27.110 --> 02:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
so I believe that the real estate
 
02:50:31.429 --> 02:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
transfer tax is perhaps the most
 
02:50:33.770 --> 02:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
volatile of the major taxes that we're
 
02:50:33.780 --> 02:50:35.630 align:start position:0%
volatile of the major taxes that we're
reviewing

02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
reviewing
 
02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:36.290 align:start position:0%
reviewing
um

02:50:36.290 --> 02:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
and uh to the extent that we see uh
 
02:50:42.770 --> 02:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
potential contraction in the business uh
 
02:50:45.650 --> 02:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
Arena we're likely to see even more so
 
02:50:48.290 --> 02:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
in the real estate Arena
 
02:50:50.030 --> 02:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax is
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
basically driven by two variables volume
 
02:50:53.929 --> 02:50:53.939 align:start position:0%
and price
 
02:50:57.889 --> 02:50:57.899 align:start position:0%
and those don't always act in sync what
 
02:51:00.469 --> 02:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
we saw for example when the pandemic set
 
02:51:00.479 --> 02:51:01.190 align:start position:0%
we saw for example when the pandemic set
in

02:51:01.190 --> 02:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
is that volume dried up
 
02:51:08.690 --> 02:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
then prices started to include to
 
02:51:11.750 --> 02:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
increase and the revenues took off in a
 
02:51:14.270 --> 02:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
way that we didn't anticipate in late 20
 
02:51:17.150 --> 02:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
and into 21 because of the price
 
02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:19.150 align:start position:0%
and into 21 because of the price
appreciation

02:51:19.150 --> 02:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
appreciation
 
02:51:21.830 --> 02:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
that Drew a lot of property into the
 
02:51:24.410 --> 02:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
market and volume increased and really
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
propelled the the revenue and then the
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
prices got to a point in combination
 
02:51:33.590 --> 02:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
with the recent interest rate hikes
 
02:51:36.950 --> 02:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
where volume is Contracting
 
02:51:40.969 --> 02:51:40.979 align:start position:0%
so I think we are moving into a period
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
where the prices are going to decline
 
02:51:46.030 --> 02:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
again there's already
 
02:51:48.290 --> 02:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
momentum in that direction in the last
 
02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
several months I believe we're now
 
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
by the case Shiller index we have seen a
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
decline in each of the last six months
 
02:52:01.910 --> 02:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
we tend to watch the residential real
 
02:52:04.849 --> 02:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
estate market more accessible to most of
 
02:52:07.030 --> 02:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
us in terms of what we see in the news
 
02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
but if you watch the commercial real
 
02:52:12.130 --> 02:52:12.140 align:start position:0%
estate markets
 
02:52:15.969 --> 02:52:15.979 align:start position:0%
it's even I think more vulnerable
 
02:52:18.889 --> 02:52:18.899 align:start position:0%
and I could I could relate specifics but
 
02:52:21.230 --> 02:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
Pemco for example which is owned by
 
02:52:23.450 --> 02:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
Alliance Bank in Germany
 
02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
bought a major portfolio of commercial
 
02:52:27.950 --> 02:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
Towers primarily in San Francisco and
 
02:52:31.570 --> 02:52:31.580 align:start position:0%
New York primco's the largest Bond
 
02:52:35.150 --> 02:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
portfolio in the United States and they
 
02:52:36.650 --> 02:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
just defaulted
 
02:52:40.250 --> 02:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
on 1.8 billion dollars in commercial
 
02:52:43.790 --> 02:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
loans so I don't I'm not
 
02:52:46.309 --> 02:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
forecasting a crash
 
02:52:50.210 --> 02:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
but I think that when you see a downturn
 
02:52:52.849 --> 02:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
in the real estate market it's going to
 
02:52:54.950 --> 02:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
be magnified particularly when volume
 
02:52:58.490 --> 02:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
and price are down simultaneously and
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the case I think for
 
02:53:05.290 --> 02:53:05.300 align:start position:0%
a good portion of 24 and likely into 25.
 
02:53:07.550 --> 02:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
I would just say one other thing in the
 
02:53:08.929 --> 02:53:08.939 align:start position:0%
information that we've just gotten
 
02:53:11.030 --> 02:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
showing a
 
02:53:14.090 --> 02:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
20 30-year track record
 
02:53:16.969 --> 02:53:16.979 align:start position:0%
of our revenues
 
02:53:19.790 --> 02:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's striking that when contractions
 
02:53:21.050 --> 02:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
have occurred
 
02:53:24.710 --> 02:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
in around 2001 and 2002
 
02:53:28.190 --> 02:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
the suddenness and steepness of the drop
 
02:53:31.790 --> 02:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
in our real estate transfer revenues has
 
02:53:35.150 --> 02:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
been as much as say 26 percent
 
02:53:38.450 --> 02:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
so I think we need to be particularly
 
02:53:40.190 --> 02:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
conservative of all of the revenue
 
02:53:42.889 --> 02:53:42.899 align:start position:0%
streams we have this is the one that I'm
 
02:53:47.530 --> 02:53:47.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:51.410 --> 02:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
I would add that the feds are not done
 
02:53:53.870 --> 02:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
increasing interest rates which does
 
02:53:55.250 --> 02:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
translating the mortgage rates
 
02:53:59.210 --> 02:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
eventually and the the higher the
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
mortgage rate the less the people will
 
02:54:03.769 --> 02:54:03.779 align:start position:0%
want to Dicker down the price
 
02:54:06.050 --> 02:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
essentially to be able to afford it or
 
02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
not buy so both volume and uh and uh
 
02:54:12.410 --> 02:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
average uh sale price probably will go
 
02:54:15.170 --> 02:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
down and so I I do think we're facing a
 
02:54:17.870 --> 02:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
recession it's going to affect here and
 
02:54:19.550 --> 02:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
the FEDS with the inflation the feds are
 
02:54:21.650 --> 02:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
going to jack up interest rates causing
 
02:54:24.650 --> 02:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:27.830 --> 02:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone
 
02:54:29.630 --> 02:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:54:31.849 --> 02:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
on that line of thinking
 
02:54:34.130 --> 02:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
um being a tax collector I've seen over
 
02:54:36.710 --> 02:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
the last 25 years many things happened
 
02:54:39.650 --> 02:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
one of which is when we go into a
 
02:54:39.660 --> 02:54:41.150 align:start position:0%
one of which is when we go into a
recession

02:54:41.150 --> 02:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
recession
 
02:54:43.969 --> 02:54:43.979 align:start position:0%
um first municipalities are required
 
02:54:46.389 --> 02:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
within a five-year period of time to
 
02:54:50.330 --> 02:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate the assessed values of their
 
02:54:55.130 --> 02:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
properties so in a situation where
 
02:54:58.190 --> 02:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
um we're in a recession if
 
02:55:02.210 --> 02:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
as the dra does an equalization ratio
 
02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
adjustment and and they check all of
 
02:55:06.889 --> 02:55:06.899 align:start position:0%
that on an annual basis
 
02:55:06.899 --> 02:55:08.269 align:start position:0%
that on an annual basis
um

02:55:08.269 --> 02:55:08.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:11.330 --> 02:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
a municipality can do a reval
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
in any particular year as long as it's
 
02:55:16.370 --> 02:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
they meet the criteria of the five-year
 
02:55:16.380 --> 02:55:18.050 align:start position:0%
they meet the criteria of the five-year
period

02:55:18.050 --> 02:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:55:22.309 --> 02:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
and so what happens then as as was said
 
02:55:24.410 --> 02:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
although the assessed values are not
 
02:55:26.110 --> 02:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
equal to
 
02:55:30.110 --> 02:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
the sales values they're pretty close
 
02:55:32.750 --> 02:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
and if your assessed value comes from
 
02:55:34.790 --> 02:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
six hundred thousand down to four
 
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand you're going to see a
 
02:55:40.250 --> 02:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
big change in the sales price therefore
 
02:55:44.389 --> 02:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a major decrease in
 
02:55:47.269 --> 02:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
the transfer tax that's collected so I
 
02:55:49.010 --> 02:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
think we have to be very conservative
 
02:55:51.469 --> 02:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
with this figure
 
02:55:54.889 --> 02:55:54.899 align:start position:0%
especially for 2025. representative
 
02:55:54.899 --> 02:55:56.570 align:start position:0%
especially for 2025. representative
Southworth

02:55:56.570 --> 02:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
Southworth
 
02:55:58.309 --> 02:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
02:56:02.750 --> 02:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
um I agree with the 2023 uh proposal I
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
had 222 for both 24 and 25. I know
 
02:56:08.690 --> 02:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
that's too many 20s in a sentence
 
02:56:12.950 --> 02:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
um but 222 for 24 222 for 25 which is
 
02:56:15.349 --> 02:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
basically the median I do think there
 
02:56:16.730 --> 02:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
are factors that are going to hurt the
 
02:56:19.070 --> 02:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
housing market but I also think there
 
02:56:21.469 --> 02:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
still is um some pressure on prices
 
02:56:24.290 --> 02:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
again in different parts of the state
 
02:56:26.570 --> 02:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
um I agree I think this is the most uh
 
02:56:28.690 --> 02:56:28.700 align:start position:0%
volatile area probably
 
02:56:31.610 --> 02:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
but it's just hard to tell
 
02:56:33.410 --> 02:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
um when some of the things are going to
 
02:56:34.730 --> 02:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
hit whether they're going to hit in 24
 
02:56:42.429 --> 02:56:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:47.389 --> 02:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry Darby thank you
 
02:56:47.399 --> 02:56:48.550 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry Darby thank you
um

02:56:48.550 --> 02:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:51.710 --> 02:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
not disputing you know the the wise
 
02:56:53.570 --> 02:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
words that were just spoken but I would
 
02:56:54.769 --> 02:56:54.779 align:start position:0%
say that
 
02:56:57.050 --> 02:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
um there as we all know that there's a
 
02:57:00.590 --> 02:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
housing crisis in New Hampshire and some
 
02:57:02.990 --> 02:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities Nashua where I'm from are
 
02:57:05.389 --> 02:57:05.399 align:start position:0%
responding to that we have almost 2 000
 
02:57:08.210 --> 02:57:08.220 align:start position:0%
units or well 1500 units that are
 
02:57:10.790 --> 02:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
planned or underway
 
02:57:12.769 --> 02:57:12.779 align:start position:0%
um and so those units are going to go up
 
02:57:14.809 --> 02:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
for sale so it's not it's not a static
 
02:57:16.610 --> 02:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
Market I guess is my perspective and
 
02:57:19.010 --> 02:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
that's why you know I
 
02:57:21.710 --> 02:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
um appreciate the the suggestions from
 
02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth
 
02:57:26.330 --> 02:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
may I just ask because I don't know
 
02:57:27.889 --> 02:57:27.899 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the Nashua is that
 
02:57:30.290 --> 02:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
are there more Apartments being created
 
02:57:31.429 --> 02:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
in Nashville now are they actually
 
02:57:34.010 --> 02:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
single-family homes where is the device
 
02:57:35.929 --> 02:57:35.939 align:start position:0%
um there's there's both
 
02:57:37.550 --> 02:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of single family homes
 
02:57:38.510 --> 02:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
going up
 
02:57:41.210 --> 02:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of uh condos going up
 
02:57:43.610 --> 02:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
um you know it's dense housing most of
 
02:57:45.889 --> 02:57:45.899 align:start position:0%
the housing that's going up is is dense
 
02:57:45.899 --> 02:57:46.969 align:start position:0%
the housing that's going up is is dense
but

02:57:46.969 --> 02:57:46.979 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:57:46.979 --> 02:57:47.929 align:start position:0%
but
um

02:57:47.929 --> 02:57:47.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:50.510 --> 02:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
um the units as I understand them are
 
02:57:54.290 --> 02:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
primarily individual sale units
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
other comments Representatives
 
02:57:59.510 --> 02:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
um I I'm actually pretty good with the
 
02:58:04.250 --> 02:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
figures for 23 and 24 but I I think that
 
02:58:06.650 --> 02:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
you know this is going to turn around at
 
02:58:08.450 --> 02:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
some point here so I would I would more
 
02:58:13.190 --> 02:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
like to see 25 at the at the 215 level
 
02:58:14.990 --> 02:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
which you know
 
02:58:16.610 --> 02:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to go down and
 
02:58:18.349 --> 02:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
down and down Forever at some point it's
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to turn around
 
02:58:22.969 --> 02:58:22.979 align:start position:0%
all the comments representative sodi yes
 
02:58:24.530 --> 02:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
the question does anybody else know any
 
02:58:27.170 --> 02:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
other districts that are like building
 
02:58:31.490 --> 02:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:33.290 --> 02:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
I see Manchester with all sorts of
 
02:58:35.870 --> 02:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
additions Big Time Dover is building a
 
02:58:37.730 --> 02:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
lot of time yeah okay great that's what
 
02:58:39.469 --> 02:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
we need right that's what we're looking
 
02:58:41.870 --> 02:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
for excellent I just didn't know if they
 
02:58:43.510 --> 02:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
were more on the apartments or more like
 
02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
single-family homes or condos that you
 
02:58:46.730 --> 02:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
would see that transfer tax
 
02:58:48.349 --> 02:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
representative gagne
 
02:58:50.990 --> 02:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
in Manchester I speak for Manchester it
 
02:58:54.410 --> 02:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
would be multiple
 
02:58:57.950 --> 02:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
apartment apartment dwellings across the
 
02:58:59.570 --> 02:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
street on Elmo street across the street
 
02:59:02.090 --> 02:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
from Market Basket there's a big couple
 
02:59:03.469 --> 02:59:03.479 align:start position:0%
of hundred unit being built there
 
02:59:05.990 --> 02:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're tearing apart on Pearl Street
 
02:59:08.929 --> 02:59:08.939 align:start position:0%
one uh parking lot and putting up multi
 
02:59:10.730 --> 02:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings there there's all
 
02:59:11.809 --> 02:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
02:59:11.819 --> 02:59:13.610 align:start position:0%
kinds of
major

02:59:13.610 --> 02:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
major
 
02:59:15.469 --> 02:59:15.479 align:start position:0%
Millions upon millions of dollars worth
 
02:59:17.870 --> 02:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
of construction people Street's another
 
02:59:20.210 --> 02:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
one that I just read about and they took
 
02:59:22.250 --> 02:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
the other concern that the Torah
 
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
building down with all the proper
 
02:59:25.730 --> 02:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
permits but it's gone well keep in mind
 
02:59:27.590 --> 02:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
though for the purposes of this tax
 
02:59:31.550 --> 02:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
revenue we're looking at sales of of the
 
02:59:34.429 --> 02:59:34.439 align:start position:0%
entity so just building more units is
 
02:59:36.830 --> 02:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
awesome thank you but it doesn't turn
 
02:59:38.990 --> 02:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
into tax revenue unless that building
 
02:59:42.410 --> 02:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
older sells yes representative thank you
 
02:59:44.210 --> 02:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
that's what I was just going to say in
 
02:59:46.730 --> 02:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
in these buildings that are being built
 
02:59:49.969 --> 02:59:49.979 align:start position:0%
now it seems to me that those sales
 
02:59:55.070 --> 02:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
would be in 2023 and maybe in 2024 but
 
02:59:58.250 --> 02:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
again we have 2025 to look at when we're
 
03:00:01.370 --> 03:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
going to be really entrenched in
 
03:00:05.389 --> 03:00:05.399 align:start position:0%
some serious issues so I think we need
 
03:00:12.889 --> 03:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:15.950 --> 03:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no other comments we have a
 
03:00:18.349 --> 03:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor
 
03:00:21.530 --> 03:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
um did you want to amend that
 
03:00:23.510 --> 03:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes Madam chairman
 
03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:24.230 align:start position:0%
yes Madam chairman

03:00:24.230 --> 03:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:26.330 --> 03:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
I would be pleased
 
03:00:28.610 --> 03:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
on the basis that it's likely to develop
 
03:00:35.870 --> 03:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:37.849 --> 03:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
okay let me just let's just repeat
 
03:00:40.389 --> 03:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
though the numbers so we're all clear
 
03:00:46.130 --> 03:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
FY 2023 would be 228.5 correct 2024
 
03:00:47.690 --> 03:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:00:51.910 --> 03:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
215 215 and then keeping it at 215 for
 
03:00:56.510 --> 03:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
2025. yes okay I agree to amend it if my
 
03:00:56.520 --> 03:00:57.610 align:start position:0%
2025. yes okay I agree to amend it if my
secondary

03:00:57.610 --> 03:00:57.620 align:start position:0%
secondary
 
03:01:00.349 --> 03:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
my second your secretary agrees to amend
 
03:01:00.359 --> 03:01:02.030 align:start position:0%
my second your secretary agrees to amend
it

03:01:02.030 --> 03:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:01:05.210 --> 03:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
one all those in favor of the new
 
03:01:07.990 --> 03:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
numbers raise your hand
 
03:01:11.570 --> 03:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
Oh yay that is almost awesome but good
 
03:01:15.469 --> 03:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
okay one two three four five six seven
 
03:01:18.710 --> 03:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
 
03:01:21.230 --> 03:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
fourteen fifteen okay so we have 15 yes
 
03:01:26.450 --> 03:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:26.460 --> 03:01:27.889 align:start position:0%
 
four

03:01:27.889 --> 03:01:27.899 align:start position:0%
four
 
03:01:30.550 --> 03:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
what is support which support
 
03:01:34.610 --> 03:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
we got another three apologize you're
 
03:01:34.620 --> 03:01:36.230 align:start position:0%
we got another three apologize you're
right

03:01:36.230 --> 03:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:01:38.889 --> 03:01:38.899 align:start position:0%
yes sorry
 
03:01:42.889 --> 03:01:42.899 align:start position:0%
so 15 to 3 is where we're at for Real
 
03:01:44.750 --> 03:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
Estate transfer Texas so that's a pretty
 
03:01:47.929 --> 03:01:47.939 align:start position:0%
decent majority thank you
 
03:01:51.650 --> 03:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
okay no we have highway so flip your
 
03:01:53.210 --> 03:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
pages over
 
03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:01.610 --> 03:02:01.620 align:start position:0%
now we have some folks here who have
 
03:02:04.130 --> 03:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
experience dealing with highways anybody
 
03:02:09.590 --> 03:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:11.389 --> 03:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
okay so do we want to break these out
 
03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
into three different things so you'd be
 
03:02:15.950 --> 03:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
talking about column a yes okay
 
03:02:15.960 --> 03:02:18.290 align:start position:0%
talking about column a yes okay
representative

03:02:18.290 --> 03:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:02:22.250 --> 03:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
okay my motion is to go with the agency
 
03:02:27.710 --> 03:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
estimate 124 3 125 125 6. for 23 24 and
 
03:02:30.050 --> 03:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
25. okay is there a second second
 
03:02:32.030 --> 03:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
in seconds
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay let's hear your thoughts
 
03:02:38.769 --> 03:02:38.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:43.370 --> 03:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
can anybody here understand why
 
03:02:43.380 --> 03:02:45.170 align:start position:0%
can anybody here understand why
on

03:02:45.170 --> 03:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:02:52.070 --> 03:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
they think that it's going up in 23 when
 
03:02:54.410 --> 03:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
at least the Turnpike tolls that I've
 
03:02:56.150 --> 03:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
been following a long time that I gave
 
03:02:59.090 --> 03:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
people copies of too late last night to
 
03:03:02.750 --> 03:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
look at probably show on
 
03:03:04.490 --> 03:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
03:03:09.050 --> 03:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
of red ink for 23 over 22.
 
03:03:11.809 --> 03:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
my responsibility because the weather
 
03:03:13.910 --> 03:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
was terrible yeah but this isn't the
 
03:03:15.710 --> 03:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
this isn't the Turnpike tolls this is
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
the gas tax I know I know but that on
 
03:03:21.230 --> 03:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
presumably the same thing it would be
 
03:03:24.410 --> 03:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
happening off the turnpikes
 
03:03:26.450 --> 03:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
we don't get the numbers though I
 
03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
understand they have the numbers and we
 
03:03:30.530 --> 03:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
should have tried to get them
 
03:03:32.990 --> 03:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
inside at least at one point they
 
03:03:36.769 --> 03:03:36.779 align:start position:0%
produced numbers from dot or traffic
 
03:03:42.830 --> 03:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:46.610 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:03:46.610 --> 03:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:48.469 --> 03:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
um to
 
03:03:50.630 --> 03:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
potentially answer representative Ami's
 
03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
question I I don't know the exact answer
 
03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
but I do know that I read recently that
 
03:03:55.920 --> 03:03:57.110 align:start position:0%
but I do know that I read recently that
we

03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:04:00.230 --> 03:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
've got 7 000 new residents in New
 
03:04:03.370 --> 03:04:03.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the last three years
 
03:04:05.570 --> 03:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
that's automatically going to mean them
 
03:04:08.090 --> 03:04:08.100 align:start position:0%
filling up a large portion of them
 
03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
driving traditional gasoline vehicles
 
03:04:13.849 --> 03:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
will be filling up and there seems to be
 
03:04:16.250 --> 03:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
a continuing Trend right now anyhow for
 
03:04:19.150 --> 03:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
people coming from
 
03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
some of the other states especially
 
03:04:24.769 --> 03:04:24.779 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the millionaires tax is
 
03:04:26.389 --> 03:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
potentially estimated to bring more
 
03:04:29.389 --> 03:04:29.399 align:start position:0%
people from Mass up here as well so
 
03:04:29.399 --> 03:04:29.990 align:start position:0%
people from Mass up here as well so
um

03:04:29.990 --> 03:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:32.450 --> 03:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
because you're right in general if you
 
03:04:34.490 --> 03:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
if if it was static and populations were
 
03:04:36.710 --> 03:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
static slowly people are buying
 
03:04:38.570 --> 03:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
electronic vehicles that number would go
 
03:04:40.010 --> 03:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
down but I think it's the increasing
 
03:04:45.170 --> 03:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:47.090 --> 03:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
03:04:51.530 --> 03:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
questions thoughts representative Darby
 
03:04:55.130 --> 03:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry um I'll just say that
 
03:04:57.769 --> 03:04:57.779 align:start position:0%
um the um with the increase in
 
03:04:59.870 --> 03:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
population this is this is only a 0.5
 
03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
percent increase you know year to year
 
03:05:03.349 --> 03:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's what it looks like to me so it's
 
03:05:05.570 --> 03:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
and that's that's going to be under the
 
03:05:07.730 --> 03:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
rate of inflation and
 
03:05:09.410 --> 03:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
um and this you know this is based on
 
03:05:15.550 --> 03:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:19.130 --> 03:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
the gas tax is fixed cents per gallon
 
03:05:21.230 --> 03:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
yeah this is the gas tax cents per
 
03:05:24.590 --> 03:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
gallon and so it it goes up only because
 
03:05:27.290 --> 03:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
the number of gallons are go up which
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
means more mileage and that's the
 
03:05:31.190 --> 03:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
additional population and maybe more
 
03:05:33.410 --> 03:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
people taking vacations up here
 
03:05:39.590 --> 03:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:41.150 --> 03:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative fellows did you have a
 
03:05:43.370 --> 03:05:43.380 align:start position:0%

oh we still have to do the other columns
 
03:06:17.929 --> 03:06:17.939 align:start position:0%
yeah very small amounts but we'll do
 
03:06:19.610 --> 03:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll take them one by one

03:07:22.130 --> 03:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why they are
 
03:07:24.590 --> 03:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
essentially flat on Motor Vehicle fees
 
03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
when I think we're still trying to
 
03:07:30.230 --> 03:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
digest the change from a four-year to a
 
03:07:30.240 --> 03:07:31.910 align:start position:0%
digest the change from a four-year to a
five-year

03:07:31.910 --> 03:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
five-year
 
03:07:36.410 --> 03:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:38.929 --> 03:07:38.939 align:start position:0%
or was it a five-year to a four year I
 
03:07:41.330 --> 03:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
forget four to four to five four to five
 
03:07:41.340 --> 03:07:43.849 align:start position:0%
forget four to four to five four to five
yeah

03:07:43.849 --> 03:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:07:46.490 --> 03:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe that year isn't in those
 
03:07:46.500 --> 03:07:47.740 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe that year isn't in those
four

03:07:47.740 --> 03:07:47.750 align:start position:0%
four

03:07:57.469 --> 03:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
there's anything else representative on
 
03:08:00.590 --> 03:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
me on that no okay all right yes oh
 
03:08:01.910 --> 03:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
sorry representative gagne I think
 
03:08:03.290 --> 03:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
there's someone
 
03:08:05.450 --> 03:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
a three-term and transportation I think
 
03:08:08.510 --> 03:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle fees might be because
 
03:08:08.520 --> 03:08:09.889 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle fees might be because
they're

03:08:09.889 --> 03:08:09.899 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:08:12.469 --> 03:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
fewer new cars being purchased at this
 
03:08:15.950 --> 03:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
time and people are keeping their uh
 
03:08:18.650 --> 03:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
used cars a lot longer and the motor
 
03:08:21.230 --> 03:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle fees are less the older the car
 
03:08:21.240 --> 03:08:23.889 align:start position:0%
vehicle fees are less the older the car
becomes

03:08:23.889 --> 03:08:23.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:26.210 --> 03:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you
 
03:08:28.370 --> 03:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
okay all those in favor accepting the

um okay let's be back here 2 15 and um
hopefully

03:09:16.250 --> 03:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
um we'll have what we need and we can
 
03:09:41.230 --> 03:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:43.090 align:start position:0%

is
 
03:10:06.469 --> 03:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know who our subject's
 
03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
going to be next week we're down one
 
04:16:07.870 --> 04:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:11.570 --> 04:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
wow Chris got it done thank you thank
 
04:16:16.309 --> 04:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:20.570 --> 04:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
okay so before you you have uh hopefully
 
04:16:23.630 --> 04:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
everything that we have talked about and
 
04:16:27.349 --> 04:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
voted on together in a consensus
 
04:16:27.359 --> 04:16:29.050 align:start position:0%
voted on together in a consensus
fashion

04:16:29.050 --> 04:16:29.060 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
04:16:32.450 --> 04:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
and now is our chance to Eagle Eye it
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
and if we see any kind of mistake Now's
 
04:16:39.110 --> 04:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:41.510 --> 04:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
so take your time go through it compare
 
04:17:49.630 --> 04:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:53.050 --> 04:17:53.060 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms are gross before the
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:31.969 --> 04:21:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
04:21:37.309 --> 04:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
is it time to ask a question uh yeah I
 
04:21:40.010 --> 04:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
hold on everyone good looking at this do
 
04:21:41.689 --> 04:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
we need more time
 
04:21:44.030 --> 04:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
good I'm just asking a general question
 
04:21:45.710 --> 04:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
04:21:47.450 --> 04:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure
 
04:21:49.150 --> 04:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
um for the totals
 
04:21:52.610 --> 04:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
2024 to 20 uh 25.
 
04:21:52.620 --> 04:21:53.210 align:start position:0%
2024 to 20 uh 25.
um

04:21:53.210 --> 04:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:55.790 --> 04:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
the revenue only goes up one million is
 
04:21:58.370 --> 04:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
that because of the loss and interest in
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
dividends that knocks out the other
 
04:22:00.000 --> 04:22:03.769 align:start position:0%
dividends that knocks out the other
increases

04:22:03.769 --> 04:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:06.469 --> 04:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
it's the only big loss I see from 24 to
 
04:22:09.410 --> 04:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
25 is interest in dividends
 
04:22:11.150 --> 04:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
because most other things go up a little
 
04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:17.570 --> 04:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
they just don't do that
 
04:22:25.610 --> 04:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
um if I look at
 
04:22:28.560 --> 04:22:35.830 align:start position:0%
um if I look at
age

04:22:35.830 --> 04:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:39.290 --> 04:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
line 19.
 
04:22:45.290 --> 04:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
goes up one million to line 25.
 
04:22:48.769 --> 04:22:48.779 align:start position:0%
most other things on line 19 to line 25
 
04:22:51.650 --> 04:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
go up slightly except for interest and
 
04:22:53.630 --> 04:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
dividends drops quite a bit
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
so is that drop and interest in
 
04:22:58.130 --> 04:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
dividends sort of canceling out all the
 
04:23:00.650 --> 04:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
other ones that are going up slightly
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
that may be part of it representative
 
04:23:05.389 --> 04:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
yeah because that's a big draw
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
and that would account for
 
04:23:07.560 --> 04:23:08.090 align:start position:0%
and that would account for
um

04:23:08.090 --> 04:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:10.490 --> 04:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
the end result right I just wanted to
 
04:23:17.150 --> 04:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:18.889 --> 04:23:18.899 align:start position:0%
so that's something that's already built
 
04:23:20.750 --> 04:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
in so it really you know is is a
 
04:23:30.889 --> 04:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:33.769 --> 04:23:33.779 align:start position:0%
the municipal transfer part of that too
 
04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
if you're comparing
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
22 to r25 so the municipal transfer
 
04:23:42.410 --> 04:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
isn't in the revenues it's subtracted
 
04:23:44.330 --> 04:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
from the meals and rooms
 
04:23:47.330 --> 04:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
so that's what Lindsay and I worked on
 
04:23:49.610 --> 04:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
um when we took that short break earlier
 
04:23:54.229 --> 04:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
but was it subtracted in 22
 
04:23:56.410 --> 04:23:56.420 align:start position:0%
. so yep
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay so that's not so so we're trying to
 
04:24:01.309 --> 04:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
get you Apples to Apples comparisons
 
04:24:03.170 --> 04:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
with the meals and rooms Revenue so we
 
04:24:05.630 --> 04:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
we netted out the municipal transfer in
 
04:24:08.150 --> 04:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
23 24 and 25 so we had to do
 
04:24:11.210 --> 04:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
calculations to get that one too
 
04:24:13.610 --> 04:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
so in 20
 
04:24:13.620 --> 04:24:16.010 align:start position:0%
so in 20
23

04:24:16.010 --> 04:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
23
 
04:24:19.729 --> 04:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
no I understand that I'm comparing 22 2
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes 25 yes so 22 the municipal transfer
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
has been taken out it's accounted for in
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
the act for
 
04:24:32.330 --> 04:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:34.610 --> 04:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh representative Southworth
 
04:24:37.309 --> 04:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
just quickly running through the lines
 
04:24:39.410 --> 04:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
you're right about interest and
 
04:24:41.450 --> 04:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
dividends being the primary driver who's
 
04:24:43.729 --> 04:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
23 million they're about four others but
 
04:24:46.790 --> 04:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
hey tobacco yeah and uh yeah I have them
 
04:24:48.290 --> 04:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
circled and other and you've got your
 
04:24:51.229 --> 04:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
answer it does yeah and that's just cash
 
04:24:53.150 --> 04:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
out for one small increases that we did
 
04:24:54.950 --> 04:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
in others yeah real estate too yeah
 
04:24:57.530 --> 04:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
right yes that's I have those circles
 
04:24:57.540 --> 04:25:19.189 align:start position:0%
right yes that's I have those circles
yep

04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:19.199 --> 04:25:37.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:25:37.849 --> 04:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:39.290 --> 04:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
do you want to just walk us through this
 
04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit and point out some things
 
04:25:42.110 --> 04:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
for us we make sure we're looking at
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:49.189 --> 04:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
starting on page four is the start of

your business taxes on line 13 for
 
04:26:00.170 --> 04:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 the committee tentatively
 
04:26:02.349 --> 04:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
agreed to a number of
 
04:26:05.210 --> 04:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
1.235 billion
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
then Nightline 19 was 1.2 billion
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
and line 25 is 1.215 billion so that was
 
04:26:14.689 --> 04:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
done earlier today
 
04:26:16.429 --> 04:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
yep everyone agree with that those are
 
04:26:19.790 --> 04:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
the numbers we agreed to okay great go
 
04:26:21.649 --> 04:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
to column B we'll do the meals and rooms
 
04:26:23.330 --> 04:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
you came up with a base number in fiscal
 
04:26:27.050 --> 04:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
year 23 and line 13 at 308.5
 
04:26:29.769 --> 04:26:29.779 align:start position:0%
from that and with the desire to grow
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
the revenue by 1.5 percent and 24 and
 
04:26:37.250 --> 04:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
2.5 percent in 25. so what we had to do
 
04:26:39.590 --> 04:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
was take the 308.5 which is a net
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
revenue and gross it back up to a number
 
04:26:45.290 --> 04:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
prior to the municipal Revenue Municipal
 
04:26:47.510 --> 04:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
transfer happening so that brought you
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
to uh a gross revenue of 436.5 million
 
04:26:54.290 --> 04:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
from that we grew up by the 1.5 and then
 
04:26:56.030 --> 04:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
again by 2.5
 
04:27:00.050 --> 04:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
and that results in row 19 of 309.5
 
04:27:04.429 --> 04:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
million in row 25 of 318.9 million
 
04:27:06.530 --> 04:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
because from that we removed the
 
04:27:08.530 --> 04:27:08.540 align:start position:0%
municipal transfer
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
mathematically is it the same thing if
 
04:27:13.370 --> 04:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
you just grow the net by 1.15 wouldn't
 
04:27:14.929 --> 04:27:14.939 align:start position:0%
come out the same
 
04:27:17.050 --> 04:27:17.060 align:start position:0%
so the transfer to the municipal Revenue
 
04:27:19.849 --> 04:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
it it's close because the revenue is
 
04:27:22.849 --> 04:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
close but the transfer is based on the
 
04:27:25.070 --> 04:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
prior year revenues and so and you have
 
04:27:26.570 --> 04:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
to make some adjustments to that with
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
what gets transferred in education trust
 
04:27:31.370 --> 04:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
fund some administrative expense so when
 
04:27:33.410 --> 04:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
that 30 is calculated it's on a
 
04:27:38.570 --> 04:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:38.580 --> 04:27:40.610 align:start position:0%

04:27:43.370 --> 04:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
this was you did this the I think Monday
 
04:27:47.330 --> 04:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
but I could be off on that row 13 was
 
04:27:47.340 --> 04:27:48.889 align:start position:0%
but I could be off on that row 13 was
219.9

04:27:48.889 --> 04:27:48.899 align:start position:0%
219.9
 
04:27:51.710 --> 04:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
row 19 was 214 4.
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
and I'll just keep going through it
 
04:28:01.010 --> 04:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
unless somebody stops you guys see
 
04:28:02.389 --> 04:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
something that looks different from your
 
04:28:05.809 --> 04:28:05.819 align:start position:0%
notes let's just stop and check it out
 
04:28:08.750 --> 04:28:08.760 align:start position:0%

04:29:20.330 --> 04:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
column I is the court fees you did this
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
the other day
 
04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
um row 13 was 13 8 19 row 19 is 13 9 and
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
row 9 25 is 14 1. excuse me
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
Securities Revenue
 
04:29:35.050 --> 04:29:35.060 align:start position:0%
was 45
 
04:29:39.469 --> 04:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
8 and 46 6.
 
04:29:42.110 --> 04:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
beer tax was 13-2

04:29:50.450 --> 04:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
column L which is the other Revenue
 
04:29:57.050 --> 04:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
we had 97 and 23 99 and 25 and 94.6 in
 
04:29:57.060 --> 04:29:58.969 align:start position:0%
we had 97 and 23 99 and 25 and 94.6 in
25.

04:29:58.969 --> 04:29:58.979 align:start position:0%
25.
 
04:30:03.309 --> 04:30:03.319 align:start position:0%
Lottery Revenue was 170.8
 
04:30:08.330 --> 04:30:08.340 align:start position:0%

tobacco settlement
 
04:30:12.110 --> 04:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
was 42

04:30:19.070 --> 04:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
under page six let's start with column o
 
04:30:21.710 --> 04:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
which is the utility property tax
 
04:30:25.210 --> 04:30:25.220 align:start position:0%
row 13 was 42.8
 
04:30:31.550 --> 04:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:35.590 --> 04:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax was 263.1 and
 
04:30:39.530 --> 04:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
363.1 and 24 and 25.
 
04:30:42.649 --> 04:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recoveries was 2.6
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
2 and 2.1
 
04:30:48.889 --> 04:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
when you go to column r that gives you a
 
04:30:50.469 --> 04:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
total of
 
04:30:53.929 --> 04:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
3.115.1 for 23.
 
04:30:58.729 --> 04:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
for row nine it's 3.134
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
and for row 25 it's three one three five
 
04:31:04.849 --> 04:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:06.830 --> 04:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
the last two columns after that is just
 
04:31:07.910 --> 04:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
to show you
 
04:31:10.250 --> 04:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
um up to that point it's current law
 
04:31:12.769 --> 04:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
and if people were wanting to see what
 
04:31:14.450 --> 04:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
the governor's revenues and His official
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
estimates were it doesn't include CST
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue in 24 and 25 so that just makes
 
04:31:21.530 --> 04:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
an adjustment the last two columns if
 
04:31:24.649 --> 04:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
there's some questions on comparability
 
04:31:29.450 --> 04:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:31.189 --> 04:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
those are your Highway funds that you
 
04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:39.410 --> 04:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
in in all instances you took the
 
04:31:42.649 --> 04:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
agency's recommendation so in 23 row 10
 
04:31:48.410 --> 04:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
you have 124.3 0.2 and 133.2 for a total
 
04:31:52.370 --> 04:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
row 15 you took 125.
 
04:31:55.920 --> 04:31:57.189 align:start position:0%
row 15 you took 125.
2

04:31:57.189 --> 04:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
2
 
04:32:01.070 --> 04:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
133.6 for 258.8 which matches the
 
04:32:02.929 --> 04:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
governor but it's just in a slightly
 
04:32:04.670 --> 04:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
different bucket
 
04:32:07.309 --> 04:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
so those about two hundred thousand
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
dollars that was added to the gas road
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
toll and taken out of the motor vehicle
 
04:32:14.090 --> 04:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
fee but the total number is the same
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
and it's the same type of thing for the
 
04:32:19.849 --> 04:32:19.859 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 uh row 20 you had 125 6
 
04:32:23.870 --> 04:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
200 000 and then 133.5 for a total of
 
04:32:23.880 --> 04:32:27.290 align:start position:0%
200 000 and then 133.5 for a total of
259.3

04:32:27.290 --> 04:32:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.849 --> 04:32:28.859 align:start position:0%
so that's your Highway
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh unrestricted revenues you go to page
 
04:32:33.769 --> 04:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
10 you have your fishing game on
 
04:32:35.450 --> 04:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
restricted revenues
 
04:32:38.689 --> 04:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
which you did the other day
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
row 11 you had 9.8 and 4 million for a
 
04:32:45.050 --> 04:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
total of 13.8 million
 
04:32:47.149 --> 04:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
using the agency's estimates as they
 
04:32:50.269 --> 04:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
provided some more up-to-date figures
 
04:32:52.969 --> 04:32:52.979 align:start position:0%
and then for six row 16 you had nine
 
04:32:56.450 --> 04:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
eight and three point six for 13.4 and
 
04:32:58.490 --> 04:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
the same numbers for 25.
 
04:33:00.649 --> 04:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
which aligned basically with the
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
governor's numbers
 
04:33:04.250 --> 04:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
and the agency's numbers and so that's
 
04:33:14.810 --> 04:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.929 --> 04:33:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
and correct me Chris if I have this
 
04:33:26.689 --> 04:33:26.699 align:start position:0%
wrong but uh my quick calculations show
 
04:33:26.699 --> 04:33:28.131 align:start position:0%
wrong but uh my quick calculations show
that

04:33:28.131 --> 04:33:28.141 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:33:31.189 --> 04:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
when we consider the governor's revenues
 
04:33:31.199 --> 04:33:34.070 align:start position:0%
when we consider the governor's revenues
versus

04:33:34.070 --> 04:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:37.250 --> 04:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
the likely house Ways and Means
 
04:33:37.260 --> 04:33:40.330 align:start position:0%
the likely house Ways and Means
estimates

04:33:40.330 --> 04:33:40.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:40.340 --> 04:33:41.869 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:33:41.869 --> 04:33:41.879 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:33:44.689 --> 04:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
in the first year 23
 
04:33:49.609 --> 04:33:49.619 align:start position:0%
were 42 million dollars
 
04:33:49.619 --> 04:33:50.570 align:start position:0%
were 42 million dollars
um

04:33:50.570 --> 04:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:50.580 --> 04:33:52.250 align:start position:0%
um
higher

04:33:52.250 --> 04:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:33:55.070 --> 04:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm a governor
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
or is it lower lower I'm sorry lower
 
04:33:59.269 --> 04:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
yeah lower
 
04:34:03.170 --> 04:34:03.180 align:start position:0%
and then in the following year
 
04:34:05.390 --> 04:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:34:07.310 --> 04:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the
 
04:34:10.369 --> 04:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
column that includes the removal of
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
communications tax
 
04:34:13.080 --> 04:34:14.209 align:start position:0%
communications tax
um

04:34:14.209 --> 04:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:18.051 --> 04:34:18.061 align:start position:0%
where 28 million lower
 
04:34:22.730 --> 04:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:25.429 --> 04:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
26 do I do that wrong
 
04:34:25.439 --> 04:34:27.769 align:start position:0%
26 do I do that wrong
28.

04:34:27.769 --> 04:34:27.779 align:start position:0%
28.
 
04:34:30.769 --> 04:34:30.779 align:start position:0%
um and then in the 25 were almost
 
04:34:33.529 --> 04:34:33.539 align:start position:0%
exactly the same 3 million less and
 
04:34:35.810 --> 04:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
again that's after
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
the communications tax is is that do I
 
04:34:40.970 --> 04:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
have that right
 
04:34:43.010 --> 04:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
you do if you were comparing to what the
 
04:34:45.170 --> 04:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
governor's proposing yeah
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
um when the Surplus statement is put
 
04:34:48.890 --> 04:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
together by our office we would use
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
current law so we would add back the 28
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
um 0.9 related to the communication
 
04:34:57.410 --> 04:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
services for the governor right and then
 
04:34:59.209 --> 04:34:59.219 align:start position:0%
we'd have an adjustment on schedule two
 
04:35:01.551 --> 04:35:01.561 align:start position:0%
to take it back out
 
04:35:06.051 --> 04:35:06.061 align:start position:0%
so what I I want to uh I wanted that to
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
be on the table that to be clear on that
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
that sort of bottom line point and then
 
04:35:13.080 --> 04:35:14.090 align:start position:0%
that sort of bottom line point and then
um

04:35:14.090 --> 04:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
I will say that I expect to vote for
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
these Ways and Means numbers
 
04:35:23.810 --> 04:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
um but with with reluctance I've
 
04:35:25.970 --> 04:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
expressed myself before on the
 
04:35:29.449 --> 04:35:29.459 align:start position:0%
uncertainty of our effort here and I'm
 
04:35:31.789 --> 04:35:31.799 align:start position:0%
in particular on the business taxes and
 
04:35:34.730 --> 04:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
the rooms and meals taxes I I think
 
04:35:38.810 --> 04:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
we're coming in uh too low that's my my
 
04:35:42.529 --> 04:35:42.539 align:start position:0%
opinion as just an opinion and
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
that if if we did better on on that
 
04:35:47.150 --> 04:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
account we'd
 
04:35:52.070 --> 04:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:54.830 --> 04:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
but as I say I will I will vote for this
 
04:35:57.769 --> 04:35:57.779 align:start position:0%
uh be in the interest of moving this on
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
in the budget process and also with the
 
04:36:02.449 --> 04:36:02.459 align:start position:0%
understanding that with new information
 
04:36:05.209 --> 04:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
if it's significant that we will have
 
04:36:07.789 --> 04:36:07.799 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to express ourselves on
 
04:36:07.799 --> 04:36:10.970 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to express ourselves on
that

04:36:10.970 --> 04:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative what
 
04:36:15.769 --> 04:36:15.779 align:start position:0%
countering that any governor democrat or
 
04:36:18.289 --> 04:36:18.299 align:start position:0%
republican tends to be optimistic in
 
04:36:20.269 --> 04:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
their a revenue forecast I think they
 
04:36:22.189 --> 04:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
want to paint a Rosy picture how things
 
04:36:25.131 --> 04:36:25.141 align:start position:0%
are going and so I we're a little less
 
04:36:26.449 --> 04:36:26.459 align:start position:0%
than the governor it doesn't bother me
 
04:36:30.289 --> 04:36:30.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:33.349 --> 04:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:37.010 --> 04:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I was calculating out how far off
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
we are from the midpoint of each agency
 
04:36:42.369 --> 04:36:42.379 align:start position:0%
or that all the agencies together
 
04:36:46.010 --> 04:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
which is mostly the dra
 
04:36:50.929 --> 04:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
um and we're down just 1.3 percent from
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
the midpoint for
 
04:36:53.760 --> 04:36:54.470 align:start position:0%
the midpoint for
um

04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:54.480 --> 04:36:55.910 align:start position:0%
um
24

04:36:55.910 --> 04:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
24
 
04:36:59.869 --> 04:36:59.879 align:start position:0%
and 1.1 percent in 25.
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
so we're we're pretty damn close it is
 
04:37:06.170 --> 04:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
um painful
 
04:37:08.209 --> 04:37:08.219 align:start position:0%
for the places that the finance
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee would have to find other money
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
for or or get rid of which is
 
04:37:17.269 --> 04:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
76 million
 
04:37:24.590 --> 04:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:26.570 --> 04:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative self-worth
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh thank you basically uh ditto what
 
04:37:31.369 --> 04:37:31.379 align:start position:0%
representative Ames said I still think
 
04:37:34.250 --> 04:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
those two areas may be higher but I'll
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:43.551 --> 04:37:43.561 align:start position:0%
like dra our crystal ball is very cloudy
 
04:37:45.470 --> 04:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
today so we just don't know but thank
 
04:37:47.810 --> 04:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
you all for your hard work on this
 
04:37:49.970 --> 04:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
um representative orrs
 
04:37:52.609 --> 04:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yeah I
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
like what I hear from representative
 
04:37:57.529 --> 04:37:57.539 align:start position:0%
Ames if the numbers were to adjust
 
04:38:00.349 --> 04:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
sharply before things are done I hope we
 
04:38:02.090 --> 04:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
could go back and revisit some of them
 
04:38:04.131 --> 04:38:04.141 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if that being a rookie
 
04:38:05.929 --> 04:38:05.939 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's possible thank
 
04:38:05.939 --> 04:38:07.789 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's possible thank
you

04:38:07.789 --> 04:38:07.799 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:38:10.010 --> 04:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
we can always make our case
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
what the finance listens to us they are
 
04:38:14.631 --> 04:38:14.641 align:start position:0%
an independent body but we we are the
 
04:38:16.910 --> 04:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
ones who are the revenue experts and
 
04:38:19.250 --> 04:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
they have not asked me any details about
 
04:38:21.051 --> 04:38:21.061 align:start position:0%
what we're doing they are waiting for
 
04:38:23.689 --> 04:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
our advice on that so I hope they will
 
04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
continue to ask Our advice on that
 
04:38:28.490 --> 04:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:29.990 --> 04:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:32.689 --> 04:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember doing it but I
 
04:38:34.429 --> 04:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
04:38:37.490 --> 04:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
towards the end of March if we felt we
 
04:38:39.949 --> 04:38:39.959 align:start position:0%
had enough information that we hadn't
 
04:38:41.390 --> 04:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
had before
 
04:38:43.869 --> 04:38:43.879 align:start position:0%
from insurance or somebody
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
that we could go back to finance and
 
04:38:48.289 --> 04:38:48.299 align:start position:0%
they would probably be very happy if it
 
04:38:51.170 --> 04:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:53.330 --> 04:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
that they I'm sure they'll have a list
 
04:38:54.830 --> 04:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
of things they would have liked to Chunk
 
04:38:54.840 --> 04:38:56.330 align:start position:0%
of things they would have liked to Chunk
in

04:38:56.330 --> 04:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:38:58.910 --> 04:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
I know know that you are all really
 
04:39:01.010 --> 04:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
watching on a daily basis what's
 
04:39:02.929 --> 04:39:02.939 align:start position:0%
happening with our revenues and we'll
 
04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
continue to do so and that is great
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
because if we start to see some really
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
strange things we should be talking
 
04:39:10.970 --> 04:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
about it and we should be alerting
 
04:39:10.980 --> 04:39:11.929 align:start position:0%
about it and we should be alerting
people

04:39:11.929 --> 04:39:11.939 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:39:14.449 --> 04:39:14.459 align:start position:0%
up or down whichever way they go but we
 
04:39:17.390 --> 04:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
will have more numbers every month and
 
04:39:18.890 --> 04:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
we will talk about them
 
04:39:22.369 --> 04:39:22.379 align:start position:0%
absolutely so we have a total total
 
04:39:24.949 --> 04:39:24.959 align:start position:0%
numbers before us and it would be
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have a motion to accept
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
those numbers for the three years
 
04:39:32.929 --> 04:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
is anybody interested in uh
 
04:39:34.730 --> 04:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
representative janigan
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:39:38.868 --> 04:39:38.878 align:start position:0%

these Revenue estimates as we have
 
04:39:44.030 --> 04:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
before us in the document entitled March
 
04:39:47.810 --> 04:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.820 --> 04:39:51.288 align:start position:0%
 
second

04:39:51.288 --> 04:39:51.298 align:start position:0%

this but we have a motion before us to
 
04:40:00.590 --> 04:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
accept the revenue estimates that we
 
04:40:03.050 --> 04:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
have all put together which are totaled
 
04:40:05.570 --> 04:40:05.580 align:start position:0%

magic so that we will have a resolution

to be around after he puts in the green
 
04:41:11.090 --> 04:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
sheets to make sure that the numbers are
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:17.270 --> 04:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
we will all keep checking and rechecking
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
but yes absolutely anything else anyone

04:41:27.470 --> 04:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
were awesome thank you so much for being
 
04:41:27.480 --> 04:41:28.670 align:start position:0%
were awesome thank you so much for being
here

04:41:28.670 --> 04:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:41:28.680 --> 04:41:30.948 align:start position:0%
here
yes

04:41:30.948 --> 04:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:41:33.050 --> 04:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
and I just want to give you a heads up
 
04:41:36.350 --> 04:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh next Tuesday we have several work
 
04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
sessions and one bill hearing the bill
 
04:41:41.690 --> 04:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
hearing is a second committee bill and I
 
04:41:43.850 --> 04:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
think representative ulery is an expert
 
04:41:45.170 --> 04:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
on that so we'll be looking forward to
 
04:41:47.990 --> 04:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
hearing from him on that uh and then on
 
04:41:50.330 --> 04:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we have exec sessions and I
 
04:41:52.430 --> 04:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
just listed every build that we've
 
04:41:55.128 --> 04:41:55.138 align:start position:0%
already had a hearing on I am going to
 
04:41:58.430 --> 04:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
move the start time to 115. hope that's
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay with everyone we will see what we
 
04:42:03.410 --> 04:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
can get done then it is not an absolute
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
deadline day but I wanted to start
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
working through that list because the
 
04:42:10.910 --> 04:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
next week is absolute deadline so just
 
04:42:12.288 --> 04:42:12.298 align:start position:0%
we'll get what done what we can get done
 
04:42:13.730 --> 04:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
what we feel comfortable at that time
 
04:42:18.770 --> 04:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:21.470 --> 04:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
the way I read the calendar
 
04:42:25.010 --> 04:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:28.810 --> 04:42:28.820 align:start position:0%
final deadline for bills for all bills
 
04:42:30.830 --> 04:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:42:33.650 --> 04:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
the 30th
 
04:42:36.350 --> 04:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
oh I read as March 16th did I read that
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
wrong oh no that's right I think uh if
 
04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
their first if they're one committee
 
04:42:45.410 --> 04:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
bills yes right but the other ones we
 
04:42:47.090 --> 04:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
have until the 30th along with the
 
04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
budget yes so every bill that I listed
 
04:42:51.288 --> 04:42:51.298 align:start position:0%
on the exact session notice for
 
04:42:51.298 --> 04:42:52.208 align:start position:0%
on the exact session notice for
Wednesday

04:42:52.208 --> 04:42:52.218 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
is something we've already heard and is
 
04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
all that's remaining for us to exec by
 
04:43:00.530 --> 04:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
March 16th right then we will have
 
04:43:02.448 --> 04:43:02.458 align:start position:0%
several second committee bills one I
 
04:43:06.350 --> 04:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
just mentioned to you about the oplc
 
04:43:08.390 --> 04:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
um but we also have a big marijuana bill
 
04:43:11.030 --> 04:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
coming to us guys so I'm gonna have to
 
04:43:13.368 --> 04:43:13.378 align:start position:0%
schedule that soon uh just be prepared
 
04:43:15.788 --> 04:43:15.798 align:start position:0%
that could take a little time
 
04:43:20.208 --> 04:43:20.218 align:start position:0%
on representative Ames said and I agree
 
04:43:24.490 --> 04:43:24.500 align:start position:0%
with him that the formatting
 
04:43:28.390 --> 04:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
the order of of of
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
the different parts of the bill and a
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
fair number of other things are uh wrong
 
04:43:38.810 --> 04:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
in the bill that we're getting
 
04:43:41.628 --> 04:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
oh and I don't know if that's one of the
 
04:43:44.030 --> 04:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
things they're trying to do now is to
 
04:43:47.390 --> 04:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
fix references and fix the order of the
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
bill it is rather difficult to read at
 
04:43:51.770 --> 04:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
this point I have to be honest with you
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
I haven't even read the bill yet I spent
 
04:43:56.090 --> 04:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
the whole day reading it oh good for you
 
04:43:59.150 --> 04:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
so we will uh when we have some time
 
04:44:00.948 --> 04:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
sitting on our couch this weekend we can
 
04:44:04.128 --> 04:44:04.138 align:start position:0%
all read that bill we I would recommend
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
waiting until they give us a complete
 
04:44:11.030 --> 04:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
bill is amended I hope that will be
 
04:44:13.788 --> 04:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:16.368 --> 04:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
but otherwise uh it's insane you keep
 
04:44:20.690 --> 04:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative Morris thank you
 
04:44:24.350 --> 04:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'd love to read your Cliff
 
04:44:26.030 --> 04:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
Notes on that if you're willing to share
 
04:44:28.250 --> 04:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
them then I don't have to read the whole
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
way I will remind members though when we
 
04:44:34.910 --> 04:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
get a bill as a second committee we are
 
04:44:37.310 --> 04:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
not here to open up the whole policy
 
04:44:39.470 --> 04:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
question whether it's education
 
04:44:42.770 --> 04:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
marijuana anything even with the oplc
 
04:44:45.050 --> 04:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
that decision has already been made by
 
04:44:47.570 --> 04:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
the house our Focus will be on the
 
04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
revenue aspect and I'd like to try to
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
keep us as focused on that assumingly
 
04:44:53.090 --> 04:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
possible so that we can give our
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
expertise on that representative Olney
 
04:44:59.330 --> 04:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
there is a problem with this with the
 
04:45:00.650 --> 04:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
marijuana bill
 
04:45:03.230 --> 04:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
and that they're assuming there's going
 
04:45:06.310 --> 04:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
to be I think what
 
04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative Abbas thought it was
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
going to be when he sent it to his last
 
04:45:11.280 --> 04:45:12.170 align:start position:0%
going to be when he sent it to his last
term

04:45:12.170 --> 04:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:45:16.190 --> 04:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
and as we had done calculating time
 
04:45:18.470 --> 04:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
after time in this committee we were
 
04:45:22.310 --> 04:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
looking at 30 to 50 million a year Max
 
04:45:25.730 --> 04:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
and they're looking to get rid of the
 
04:45:28.250 --> 04:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
pension fund problems
 
04:45:31.070 --> 04:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
with that money and do a bunch of other
 
04:45:31.080 --> 04:45:32.390 align:start position:0%
with that money and do a bunch of other
things

04:45:32.390 --> 04:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:45:35.868 --> 04:45:35.878 align:start position:0%
and then the other problem is none of
 
04:45:38.150 --> 04:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
them seem to know anything about farmers
 
04:45:39.770 --> 04:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
and farming
 
04:45:41.510 --> 04:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
and I've been in touch with the Farm
 
04:45:43.730 --> 04:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
Bureau but I haven't heard back from
 
04:45:48.410 --> 04:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
them about on whether they think that
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
the funding mechanism in their
 
04:45:56.090 --> 04:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
is capable of working
 
04:46:02.090 --> 04:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:05.510 --> 04:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
because they are trying to get 15
 
04:46:07.850 --> 04:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
percent of the gross
 
04:46:12.830 --> 04:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
from Farmers every time every month
 
04:46:15.410 --> 04:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
and these farmers are going to have had
 
04:46:18.770 --> 04:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
enormous Capital expenses
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
if if I could ask all of you to think
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
about and advise me because we're gonna
 
04:46:26.090 --> 04:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
have to schedule this soonish uh maybe
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
not next week but the week after how
 
04:46:30.110 --> 04:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
much time we should allocate and how
 
04:46:31.730 --> 04:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
much space I've already gotten a number
 
04:46:34.368 --> 04:46:34.378 align:start position:0%
of phone calls uh the people want my
 
04:46:35.930 --> 04:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
support and so forth so I don't know if
 
04:46:38.150 --> 04:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to get a lot of people here
 
04:46:40.730 --> 04:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
who's going to be here should we move to
 
04:46:42.890 --> 04:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
reps Hall I'd love to get your input on
 
04:46:45.288 --> 04:46:45.298 align:start position:0%
that so we can schedule it properly
 
04:46:45.298 --> 04:46:45.948 align:start position:0%
that so we can schedule it properly
um

04:46:45.948 --> 04:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:47.810 --> 04:46:47.820 align:start position:0%
yes please um
 
04:46:49.610 --> 04:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
I think part of that which we've had
 
04:46:51.230 --> 04:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
trouble with on this committee before is
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
we have to make it crystal clear that
 
04:46:55.010 --> 04:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the underlying
 
04:46:57.650 --> 04:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
bill because in the past the people that
 
04:47:00.350 --> 04:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
are pro or whatever have all come and we
 
04:47:01.970 --> 04:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to listen to them or
 
04:47:04.310 --> 04:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
anything so I think somehow making that
 
04:47:07.368 --> 04:47:07.378 align:start position:0%
clear also I assume the dra will be
 
04:47:08.990 --> 04:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
available when we're talking about the
 
04:47:09.000 --> 04:47:11.030 align:start position:0%
available when we're talking about the
money

04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:47:13.368 --> 04:47:13.378 align:start position:0%
is it dra or is it liquor correction
 
04:47:18.410 --> 04:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
exactly that someone will be yes yes uh
 
04:47:23.930 --> 04:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:27.470 --> 04:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
this analysis themselves before
 
04:47:29.390 --> 04:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
they were part of our work product
 
04:47:29.400 --> 04:47:30.970 align:start position:0%
they were part of our work product
before

04:47:30.970 --> 04:47:30.980 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative abrami is very much part
 
04:47:36.890 --> 04:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
of our work product also by the way uh
 
04:47:39.770 --> 04:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
and liquor
 
04:47:43.850 --> 04:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
as I think I pointed out last time
 
04:47:46.788 --> 04:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
liquor but maybe it was someone else
 
04:47:51.430 --> 04:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
liquor understands wine in bottles
 
04:47:55.910 --> 04:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh plants grown grown even in a
 
04:47:55.920 --> 04:47:57.128 align:start position:0%
uh plants grown grown even in a
greenhouse

04:47:57.128 --> 04:47:57.138 align:start position:0%
greenhouse
 
04:48:00.288 --> 04:48:00.298 align:start position:0%
on and
 
04:48:00.298 --> 04:48:01.490 align:start position:0%
on and
and

04:48:01.490 --> 04:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:01.500 --> 04:48:02.410 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:48:02.410 --> 04:48:02.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:05.030 --> 04:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
customers that come into a totally
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
separate out out uh
 
04:48:10.010 --> 04:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
I think the retailers are going to just
 
04:48:12.288 --> 04:48:12.298 align:start position:0%
have to get licenses this time which is
 
04:48:14.448 --> 04:48:14.458 align:start position:0%
an improvement but
 
04:48:14.458 --> 04:48:15.170 align:start position:0%
an improvement but
um

04:48:15.170 --> 04:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:16.910 --> 04:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
I wonder if it makes sense that I'll
 
04:48:19.128 --> 04:48:19.138 align:start position:0%
reach out to our committee researcher to
 
04:48:21.288 --> 04:48:21.298 align:start position:0%
see if she can get some other data from
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
other states and so forth okay that's
 
04:48:26.510 --> 04:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
what we
 
04:48:29.628 --> 04:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
done before and what we depended on all
 
04:48:32.690 --> 04:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
the other states data and there is maybe
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
we could distribute representative
 
04:48:38.810 --> 04:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
abrami's latest uh
 
04:48:42.470 --> 04:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
report on a cannabis
 
04:48:45.470 --> 04:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
he was he doesn't like cannabis but he
 
04:48:47.330 --> 04:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
was very fair about this
 
04:48:49.550 --> 04:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
okay absolutely
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh did you have anything you want to add
 
04:48:55.128 --> 04:48:55.138 align:start position:0%
or okay great yes representative
 
04:48:57.530 --> 04:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
um two things number one I don't know if
 
04:49:00.230 --> 04:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's done but maybe it ought to be that
 
04:49:02.090 --> 04:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
in the legislative calendar when this
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
comes up there should be in bold caps
 
04:49:07.610 --> 04:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
please don't put more nicely than this
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
please don't come debating whether you
 
04:49:12.530 --> 04:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
want marijuana legalized or not or
 
04:49:14.208 --> 04:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
decriminalized or not we are only
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
talking about financial implications I
 
04:49:17.930 --> 04:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
will consult with a house Clerk and how
 
04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
we can delicately but firmly say that
 
04:49:25.550 --> 04:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
and and yes I would ER one of the very
 
04:49:27.948 --> 04:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
few rules I have for myself is it almost
 
04:49:29.628 --> 04:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
always takes longer than you think and
 
04:49:33.708 --> 04:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what it is so however
 
04:49:36.530 --> 04:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
much time you might think we need maybe
 
04:49:38.330 --> 04:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
add 50 percent
 
04:49:40.310 --> 04:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and just so you know the chairman
 
04:49:42.650 --> 04:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
of Commerce who is the one who has sent
 
04:49:45.350 --> 04:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
this bill to us has requested that he
 
04:49:47.690 --> 04:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
wants to be here at nine nine a.m for
 
04:49:49.730 --> 04:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
whatever the hearing date is so just be
 
04:49:52.128 --> 04:49:52.138 align:start position:0%
prepared I know we prefer 10 in this
 
04:49:54.650 --> 04:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
room but he has asked for 9am so I will
 
04:49:57.730 --> 04:49:57.740 align:start position:0%
try to accommodate him what's that
 
04:50:00.650 --> 04:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
yeah well just the chairman of the
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee has a lot of bills
 
04:50:03.650 --> 04:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
and he's trying to get through those and
 
04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
most of his stuff starts at 10. so he
 
04:50:07.850 --> 04:50:07.860 align:start position:0%
needs to start here with us and then
 
04:50:09.550 --> 04:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
continue on from there representative
 
04:50:12.470 --> 04:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
rough guesstimate is the marijuana
 
04:50:15.350 --> 04:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue was take Massachusetts and
 
04:50:17.208 --> 04:50:17.218 align:start position:0%
divide by seven
 
04:50:19.730 --> 04:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
that sounds very scientific the the
 
04:50:23.448 --> 04:50:23.458 align:start position:0%
logic is uh no the logic is six million
 
04:50:24.890 --> 04:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
people there one million people here
 
04:50:27.650 --> 04:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
we're buying a mass so uh we would we
 
04:50:29.530 --> 04:50:29.540 align:start position:0%
would retain the Massachusetts
 
04:50:32.510 --> 04:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh the people buying it messages would
 
04:50:35.628 --> 04:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
buy it here so so we if we're one one
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
seventh of the uh population of both
 
04:50:38.160 --> 04:50:41.330 align:start position:0%
seventh of the uh population of both
States

04:50:41.330 --> 04:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.368 --> 04:50:43.378 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll get more information on
 
04:50:46.010 --> 04:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
this so uh that's that's going off a few
 
04:50:48.110 --> 04:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
weeks so we we got this major hurdle
 
04:50:48.120 --> 04:50:48.948 align:start position:0%
weeks so we we got this major hurdle
done

04:50:48.948 --> 04:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:50:51.948 --> 04:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative Ames I I think
 
04:50:54.170 --> 04:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
you'll pick this up anyway but as I
 
04:50:55.850 --> 04:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
recall there's not a fiscal note on this
 
04:50:57.288 --> 04:50:57.298 align:start position:0%
uh Bill and
 
04:50:59.930 --> 04:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
and uh The Liquor Commission I think is
 
04:51:03.170 --> 04:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
the responsibility now and so
 
04:51:05.990 --> 04:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
I I would push for you may not get it
 
04:51:07.788 --> 04:51:07.798 align:start position:0%
but for our fiscal note there should be
 
04:51:08.990 --> 04:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
I thought I read one and I thought it
 
04:51:12.770 --> 04:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
said how much it would cost to build a
 
04:51:16.190 --> 04:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
new store and uh the number of employees
 
04:51:19.010 --> 04:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
and all that wasn't that uh
 
04:51:21.610 --> 04:51:21.620 align:start position:0%
okay it wasn't on this one
 
04:51:24.170 --> 04:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
okay so substitutes if you're interested
 
04:51:25.670 --> 04:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
in this topic maybe you can come back
 
04:51:27.190 --> 04:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:51:29.570 --> 04:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
um I haven't read the bill don't know
 
04:51:33.470 --> 04:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
how it compares the last term but I
 
04:51:36.230 --> 04:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
remember proceedings last term vividly I
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have a robust
 
04:51:39.230 --> 04:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
extensive hearing but I try to confine
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
it to a single day I would however plan
 
04:51:44.090 --> 04:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
another day for a robust committee
 
04:51:46.430 --> 04:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
discussion before we try to exec
 
04:51:46.440 --> 04:51:53.628 align:start position:0%
discussion before we try to exec
anything

04:51:53.628 --> 04:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:55.610 --> 04:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative horse thank you madam
 
04:51:56.810 --> 04:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
chair so
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
I don't smoke anything I don't gamble
 
04:52:03.708 --> 04:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
but if it increases New Hampshire's
 
04:52:05.930 --> 04:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
coffers I'm all for taking the Caps off
 
04:52:07.970 --> 04:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
gambling if we can out-compete the other
 
04:52:10.430 --> 04:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
states and bring that money in here for
 
04:52:12.470 --> 04:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
our education and our state
 
04:52:15.230 --> 04:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
and as far as cannabis
 
04:52:19.010 --> 04:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
there's a now defunct Getty Gas Station
 
04:52:22.128 --> 04:52:22.138 align:start position:0%
near my house in Chichester
 
04:52:24.830 --> 04:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
and I thought if we went and pooled our
 
04:52:27.050 --> 04:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
resources and said Getty your cannabis
 
04:52:30.050 --> 04:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
here we could be on the Forefront
 
04:52:31.730 --> 04:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:52:33.590 --> 04:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
on that note have a wonderful evening
 
04:52:35.090 --> 04:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
and thank you oh yes representative
 
04:52:37.730 --> 04:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
fellows could you just go over the dates
 
04:52:39.830 --> 04:52:39.840 align:start position:0%

04:52:42.050 --> 04:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
or did you say something about next week
 
04:52:44.510 --> 04:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay so uh off the top of my head I have
 
04:52:46.550 --> 04:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
to think about this a little bit
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
um two yeah nothing on Monday not the
 
04:52:49.970 --> 04:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
house I'm talking about just his
 
04:52:52.550 --> 04:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
committee yeah so nothing on Monday okay
 
04:52:58.250 --> 04:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
Tuesday starting at 10 we have a house a
 
04:52:59.810 --> 04:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
bill hearing
 
04:53:04.030 --> 04:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:07.190 --> 04:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
nope that's not it the office of
 
04:53:08.990 --> 04:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
Professional Licensing is coming to us
 
04:53:10.070 --> 04:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
as a second committee and then we're
 
04:53:12.470 --> 04:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
going to have three full committee work
 
04:53:15.050 --> 04:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
sessions on bills that we talked a lot
 
04:53:16.970 --> 04:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
about but so we just need to talk some
 
04:53:19.490 --> 04:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
more about maybe get some more details
 
04:53:20.570 --> 04:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
um so those will be listed in the
 
04:53:23.868 --> 04:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
calendar and then on Wednesday will be
 
04:53:26.930 --> 04:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
exec session in the afternoon
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
Thursday we have the Full House session
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
so we only meet in the afternoon on
 
04:53:35.330 --> 04:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
Wednesday yes
 
04:53:39.890 --> 04:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:42.770 --> 04:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
okay okay and then then after that I
 
04:53:44.208 --> 04:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
haven't got my head around it yet I'll
 
04:53:45.770 --> 04:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
meet with the vice chair and we'll try
 
04:53:47.570 --> 04:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
to see what we have left for bills we
 
04:53:49.730 --> 04:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
have to schedule and try to get them in
 
04:53:51.410 --> 04:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
the next week I just checked with the
 
04:53:53.208 --> 04:53:53.218 align:start position:0%
chairman of the criminal justice
 
04:53:55.250 --> 04:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
committee who we share this room with
 
04:53:58.430 --> 04:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
he's apparently done his work so we have
 
04:54:00.410 --> 04:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
pretty good access here so leave
 
04:54:02.690 --> 04:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
yourself available that week of the 13th
 
04:54:04.430 --> 04:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
I think so we can get as much done as
 
04:54:07.670 --> 04:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
possible keep in mind it's it's a lot of
 
04:54:10.910 --> 04:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
hard work in the house until April 6th
 
04:54:15.050 --> 04:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
through April 6. then it gets a little
 
04:54:15.060 --> 04:54:19.368 align:start position:0%
through April 6. then it gets a little
easier

04:54:19.368 --> 04:54:19.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:19.378 --> 04:54:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:54:23.510 --> 04:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
gets a little bit easier in the week
 
04:54:28.310 --> 04:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
between when we have to hand them the
 
04:54:31.368 --> 04:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
bills and the and the meetings on the
 
04:54:31.378 --> 04:54:32.090 align:start position:0%
bills and the and the meetings on the
floor

04:54:32.090 --> 04:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
floor
 
04:54:34.550 --> 04:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
but I think everything you said we're
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
already committed to is in the calendar
 
04:54:36.718 --> 04:54:38.628 align:start position:0%
already committed to is in the calendar
already

04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:54:38.638 --> 04:54:40.250 align:start position:0%
already
sucks

04:54:40.250 --> 04:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
sucks
 
04:54:42.170 --> 04:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
only thing is I had to change the exact
 
04:54:44.690 --> 04:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
session time from 10 a.m to 1 15 and I
 
04:54:46.490 --> 04:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
apologize about that
 
04:54:49.190 --> 04:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes this is just procedural when
 
04:54:52.430 --> 04:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
we're second committee can we retain a
 
04:54:54.050 --> 04:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
bill when we're the second committee
 
04:54:54.060 --> 04:54:55.250 align:start position:0%
bill when we're the second committee
okay

04:54:55.250 --> 04:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:54:56.810 --> 04:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
yeah we could all who have all the same
 
04:55:01.310 --> 04:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
04:55:03.600 --> 04:55:04.970 align:start position:0%
same thing
okay

04:55:04.970 --> 04:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
okay
