here I do appreciate that
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of our our meeting is to
 
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
take a look at House Bill uh 1269 and
 
00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
when it came before children and family
 
00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 align:start position:0%
law I uh had some concerns with u the
 
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
bill as proposed and initially my
 
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
inclination was going to be to recommend
 
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 align:start position:0%
itl but hearing the testimony of uh many
 
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
parents uh it was heartfelt and I felt
 
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
it would be very insensitive if we just
 
00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
dismissed this legislation and didn't
 
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
discuss it any further considering the
 
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
testimony of the parents so that's why I
 
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
requested uh that we take a look at it
 
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
as an inum study so and that's where we
 
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.310 align:start position:0%
as an inum study so and that's where we
are

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 align:start position:0%
today um
 
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
you take a look at the bill as proposed
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh amending RSA 126
 
00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 align:start position:0%
u5b it talks about as soon as practical
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
18968 Roman num 5D each use of seclusion
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
shall be visually and auditorally
 
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
recorded if such method of recording is
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
included in the students individualized
 
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
educational program or accommodating
 
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.469 align:start position:0%
educational program or accommodating
plan

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
another part that was added to the
 
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
statute in this bill was pursuant to RSA
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
18968 Roman numeral 5D each use of
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
restraint shall be visually and
 
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
auditorally recorded if such method of
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
recording is included in the students
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
individual educational program or
 
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
accommodation plan and my concern with
 
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
that language is that students with IEPs
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
are mainstreamed and from my perspective
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
this would mean that every class room
 
00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
and every school would have to be
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
equipped with um with
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
surveillances and so that was my uh
 
00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
initial concern and my inclination again
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
to uh itl it but before the committee
 
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
begins discussing uh this in detail I
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
see we have some individuals who are
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
here and this is not a public testimony
 
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony but I do welcome
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
any of you to come forward if you want
 
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
to add any insight or just any
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
perspectives you may may have before we
 
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
begin but again this is not public
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
testimony because we've already heard
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
the testimony we've looked at this bill
 
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
and now we're going to take a look at
 
00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
its merits and maybe make some
 
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations going forward so with
 
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
that you are welcome to come forward if
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
you're so inclined if not we will um we
 
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.270 align:start position:0%
you're so inclined if not we will um we
will

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
commence maren
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
definitely just um turn on the
 
00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
microphone and introduce yourself and
 
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
from oh is it on
 
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's odd because it's red instead of
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
green usually I'm used to it being green
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
um so thank you I'm Marin Tracy I'm from
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
marac New Hampshire and um I was the one
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
who kind of grabbed the legislators
 
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
together to kind of discuss this because
 
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
of the number of calls that I was
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
receiving um from families who you all
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
um saw that was just a small portion of
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
them and honestly I was just cleaning my
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
house one day and I'm like how can I try
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
to help stop this or less in this and
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
that the cameras came into my into my
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
mind to address just quickly the
 
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
concern uh in regards to in the
 
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
classroom I um in my 25 plus years of
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
education have not really seen a child
 
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
restrained in a regular Ed classroom it
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't typically happen in other in
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
front of other people and that's why and
 
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
I I you know I didn't make this language
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
I wasn't that um excited about this but
 
00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
you know some attorney put it together
 
00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 align:start position:0%
and put it through all I'm looking for
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
is um somebody else to be able to have a
 
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
voice when a child is either put in a
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
restraint or seclusion or comes home
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
with an injury and they can't
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
communicate that's really what I'm
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
looking for um so is it a person is it a
 
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
camera is it a camera on a on an adult
 
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know but um one of the
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the legislations that
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
passed last year was covered bridges
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
would have cameras because people are
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
putting graffiti on them in the middle
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
of the night when nobody's there and
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
they want to protect them and I'm like
 
00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:20.599 align:start position:0%
how do we protect our kids and I am
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
willing um to work one day a week on
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
Research or anything that you would like
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
if um you come up with an idea that
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
would really help to give children a
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
voice when they have been hurt
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
restrained or secluded that's that's
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
really all I'm asking for there are two
 
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
sides to every story um when I first
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
started an education when I was working
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
at UNH I used to visit so many different
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
schools so many different places and
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
people I guess I was unassuming people
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
would would not change their behavior in
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
front of me and I have seen kids thrown
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
against the wall I have seen kids thrown
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
onto the ground um I I've seen it and it
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
mostly happens in the Middle School it's
 
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
not we're not really talking about high
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
school um it's it's usually around um 8
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
to 10 uh 7 to 11 is the average age of
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
when this happens so that's what I would
 
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
like I would be willing to give really
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
any research anything that you would
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
like any questions um one day week if um
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
that's something that the committee
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
would like that's all thank you would
 
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
you be open 20 any questions yeah okay
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
all right before um I entertain the
 
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
other reps uh one quick question if I
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
recall you brought to my attention uh
 
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
Statute in in the state of Maine that
 
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
you thought was something that we could
 
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
model okay all right that's important to
 
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
know because I did take a look at the
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
statute and I'm looking at uh in their
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
RSA specifically um line item six that
 
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
talks about technical assistance and I
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
think this may be where what you were
 
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
referring to so just correct me if
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
that's the case it says the department
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
shall provide technical assistance to
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
cover entities by developing
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
implementing and providing technical
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
assistance to support evidence-based
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
programs that reduce the likelihood of
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
physical restraint and support students
 
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
in reducing behavior that can result in
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
physical restraint such as
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
developmentally appropriate positive
 
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
behavior interventions functional
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
Behavior interventions mental health
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
support restorative justice programs
 
00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
trauma informed care and crisis in uh
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
deescalation interventions was that the
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
part of the statute that you were making
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
reference to um yes and I do believe
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
that we do have some of that in our both
 
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
state and federal laws um and I actually
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
was one of the first um was first and
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
only PBIS coordinators here in the State
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
I have worked with many schools on
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
exactly implementing and teaching fb's
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
PBIS throughout school districts um the
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
hardest thing is for what what I see is
 
00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
that um the people who are where this is
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
happening are the least trained and they
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to tell anybody that they
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
made a mistake and um therefore it
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
escalates and we really need to support
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
those people it one like one of the
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
concerns I just saw was London Derry is
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
um par Educators and they're paying
 
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
something like don't quote me but say
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
1725 for a par educator who assists a
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
classroom in like
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
1795 to work with a behavior kid really
 
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
that's like it that's just saying that
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's not that much difference and
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
it is it it it is and you really it's
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
not fair to the adults or the young
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
people um if you're not trained properly
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
and then you feel I'm going to tell you
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
they feel embarrassed that they got this
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
to happen and then they blame the kid
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
because that that's what happens so
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's what I see well thank you and I
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
was taking a look at our Statute in
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
section 126
 
00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
u1a it talks about limitations of child
 
00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:16.519 align:start position:0%
restraint practices and it seems the way
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
I read it that there's some similarity
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
in that main statute it says the
 
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and the
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor shall work
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
cooperatively to develop consistent
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
definitions and applic of this chapter
 
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
in order to inform School administrators
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
and employees across the state of best
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
practices regarding restraint in schools
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education May utilize
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
Grant funds that are available through
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
the Department's office of students
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
Wellness for trauma responsive training
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
Consulting on de-escalating violent
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
situations and proper use of restraints
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
so I'm seeing very similar language in
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Statute in my view seems
 
00:13:01.629 --> 00:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
to be somewhat consistent with what they
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
have in Maine so Y what are your
 
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts in that regard um um I so my
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
thoughts in that regard is that I think
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
the state in my in my view the state was
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
doing a really good job preo after covid
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
anxiety went up in everybody adults and
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
young people and I think that led to
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
more behaviors as well as a lot of
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
people left the field so I I think
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
that's a lot one of the things that I
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
did research and I believe it was
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
Mississippi um um is not putting
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
something like this underneath um child
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
restraints but instead under child
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
safety including and it was included in
 
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
a bill in regards to having like locked
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
front doors and and all of that stuff so
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
it was and then it went into you know
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
cameras in the hallway cameras in the
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
lunchroom because we have cameras
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
everywhere we really do even in the
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
schools so um looking at it as far as um
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
having it maybe not in RSA 126 u in
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
restraints and seclusion cuz it's not
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
just around restraints and seclusion um
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
it it's kind of you know we we're we're
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
putting kids who are vulnerable in a PL
 
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
in a in a room away from other people
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
and things happen that's I guess the
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
bottom line okay thank you
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbons I saw you hand up
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
do you have a question oh I did but it
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
got answered thank you okay any anyone
 
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
long yeah thank you Mr chairman um so so
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
it looks like two efforts on here one
 
00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:38.350 align:start position:0%
it looks like two efforts on here one
is

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
um one is regarding the restraint itself
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh the less the better uh then the other
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
one is regarding the
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
notification um now the uh 1269 was more
 
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.350 align:start position:0%
on the
notification

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
notification
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
um and you know and the issues I had was
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
the uh um uh prior to using seclusion or
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
restraint the parent had to be notified
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
that's not always I I don't I don't
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
think I don't think that's reasonable at
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
all I don't think that I I didn't come
 
00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
up with that I don't think that's a
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable reasonable part no okay so so
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
as far as I I mean I agree that a parent
 
00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
should be notified for all kids even
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
even even if they can't um Express what
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
happened to them um I I think ought to
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
know what right child who's secluded or
 
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
restrained the parent ought to be told
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
so I guess what we're looking for is who
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for that
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
right and I I believe there is already
 
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
information and Karen Rosenberg is here
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
she could probably let you know I
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
believe we're already supposed to be
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
doing that is notifying the parent right
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
away um so and let me tell you about
 
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
functional Behavior assessment and
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things I taught
 
00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:58.519 align:start position:0%
functional Behavior assessment is who
 
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
what when where how why and you want to
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
grab that data and be able to look at it
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
and prevent it and um and and I've
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
prevented it like like I've done this
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
work that's why I can say that it works
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
and we're not collecting that
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
information who what when where how why
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
and instead if you read and I would I
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
would love for you to read any incident
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
reports it's very vague this is what the
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
child did no like it's almost like they
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
were in a room by themselves and that
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
there was nobody else there to um
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
intervening and typically an adult is is
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
looking what the trigger is in so I'll
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
give you my first experience with
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
restraint I was teaching preschool um
 
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
and a um a a there was a student who had
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
autism this was way way back so autism
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't a like as known as it is now and
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
the student did not want to put their
 
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
hand in paint and this teacher came over
 
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
and put their hand in the paint and the
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
and the student like freaked out and
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
then was put on the ground and held down
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
and it was like that was not worth you
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
know having this huge problem going on
 
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
right so what we want to know is we want
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
to prevent that from happening again so
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
so and I could give you a million
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
different examples of um of how these
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
things get triggered but it's
 
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.669 align:start position:0%
things get triggered but it's
understanding

00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
and preventing it is the biggest thing
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
yes oh sorry representative Raymond uh
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very briefly have you seen the
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
new reporting form that came out I know
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm in naswa and we adopted it um
 
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
in March and it is um 15 pages long and
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
it specifically has you have to list
 
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:53.799 align:start position:0%
every staff member that was
 
00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:56.919 align:start position:0%
involved um you have to say the all of
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
the events preceding it you have to EXP
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
explain any interventions that happened
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
before the event um and then there's
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's a narrative and there's a bunch
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
of check boxes to trigger people to
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
think about what things they should be
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
using for next time um you have to
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
provide a narrative justifying the the
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
reason that restraint or seclusion or a
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
hold was
 
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
used um you have to document any um
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
injuries that occurred before or after
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
the seclusion whether the was injured
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
during this inclusion whether the staff
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
member was injured um it just it goes on
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
and on um and so I'm wondering if and
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
then in naswa we require um notification
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
immediately by fo which is consistent
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
but we also require the parent to have a
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
copy of this form and that the form be
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
re reviewed by the superintendent and
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
the parent to get a report from the
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent saying he's reviewed it
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
he's talked to all the staff and this is
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
what his investigation found so I guess
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
my question is um given that most of
 
00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
this detail is new it wasn't state law
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
before and a lot of places there were a
 
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
lot of inconsistencies across the
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
state do does this cover some of those
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances where it provides some
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
evidence for what's going on I would say
 
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
yes it does um in regards to restraint
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
and seclusion but I just want to remind
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
you that some of the people that
 
00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
testified their kid was not restrained
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
or secluded but came home with injuries
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
so that's that's another thing but um I
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
think that this is the difference I have
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
I have seen that but I have not seen it
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
filled out and I think that's that's the
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
key there was good good um paperwork to
 
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:45.799 align:start position:0%
fill out before that that I have seen
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
but it it it's how it's filled out and
 
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
and people are not always um and usually
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
again we're going back to direct direct
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
support professionals they're not always
 
00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
trained in my experience as a teacher as
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
as an educator things would come down
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
from the state they would get funneled
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know through the specialed
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
administrator maybe a coordinator it
 
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
hardly ever gets down to the um to the
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
to the par professionals and they don't
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
have a lot of information and the the
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
main thing that they go back on for
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices is CPI right
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
and that's like the same thing over and
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
over and over
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
again right so I mean it sounds like
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
this is a I don't know I guess for me
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
we're on day four five of school um so I
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
you know I'd like to see people using it
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
and I know in Nashville we've got Dr
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
Green coming down specifically to train
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
our parent Educators so hopefully more
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
districts can do that kind of stuff
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful that's wonderful
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
chair hello good morning morning um so
 
00:20:54.669 --> 00:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing this um you know if we are
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
able to craft a bill I'm seeing that
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
this would be sort of like a two-prong
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
um reasoning one for the protection of
 
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
the children and two for a training
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
purposes so you can review the incident
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
and um you know U make sure that um
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
people are trained properly in order to
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
handle it and in the future maybe
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh maybe not uh have it get to a point
 
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799 align:start position:0%
of escalation is that what you're what
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
you would like to I think that's
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
beautiful yes I think that's beautiful I
 
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
um my my again my experience so I was an
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
educator um my daughter was on spring
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
break or whatever break and came and
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
substituted in a school that I was
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
working in and they put her with the
 
00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
hardest kid who is
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
nonverbal luckily she has a sister who
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
has prayer willly syndrome and she has
 
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
lots of experience but they didn't know
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
that right so I I I think um yeah and
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
what wait what was can you back up I'm
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
sorry the original question to was um so
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
we would see this bill as um you know
 
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
two two reasons right for for the
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
protection of the child and also for
 
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
training purposes so so that incident
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
could be reviewed and make sure that you
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
know proper procedure was followed and
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
if there was uh you know if there was
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
room to have prevented a further
 
00:22:27.789 --> 00:22:27.799 align:start position:0%
escalation yes and in in my experience
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
again to what I I see is um I I see so
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
picture any one of you all of a sudden
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
was given a a student who was non-verbal
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden started acting out
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
and you weren't sure how to do it what
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
we do is we go back to how we were
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
raised that you know that's that's kind
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
of how what was our discipline growing
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
up and and unfortunately a lot of what I
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
see is um ego that kind of gets in the
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
way like you're not going to tell me
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
what to do you're only 10 years old or
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
whatever I do you see a lot of that I
 
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
think when I taught at the at higher ed
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
what I really in um instructed my
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
teachers is really making sure to have
 
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
somebody feel safe that they made a
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
mistake and not reprimanded and say okay
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
how do we go back and look at that and
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that doesn't happen again
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
because it's hard it's not easy working
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
with somebody who who may be non-verbal
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
who has behavior and again and I always
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
say it it's not good versus bad it's
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
skills versus lack of but it I really
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
think more support needs to be caring
 
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
for the par professional so that they
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
can say I think I made a mistake uh you
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
of I'm sorry I have another question
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
it's not really a fellout but it's
 
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
related to okay thank you I forgot I
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
should have asked you this too um you
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
know um there was a mother that came
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
here and um it was very the I was very
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
um emotional about all of the testimony
 
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
on this day um and this one mother in
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
particular um talked about her son in
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
seclusion um for privacy purposes of the
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
child do you or not do you think that a
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
camera my thought would be to have a
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
camera outside of the seclusion room to
 
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
monitor who goes in and out because we
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
have limits of time
 
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
right where we where by law people need
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
to be you know going in and out um what
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
would your thought be on that e either
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
are you Pro or con a camera in the
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
seclusion room and or Pro or con a
 
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
camera outside of the seclusion room I
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
think the most important aspect to look
 
00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:50.919 align:start position:0%
at that is what happened prior so that
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
you can learn and prevent it be
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
afterwards but typically what I have
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
seen is that there's a classroom with a
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
seclusion room in it and I think what
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
you just said I don't think it needs to
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
be inside of it I think kind of seeing
 
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
what what happened in the beginning and
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
like in that instance that went on way
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
too long before you even got in there
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
right so there were so many different
 
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
pivotal points that you could have
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
turned it around you're
 
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
welcome other
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative disimon thank
 
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.430 align:start position:0%
questions representative disimon thank
you

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um I've been
 
00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:29.559 align:start position:0%
thinking a lot of about this because
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
like representative Nelson and I'm not
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
speaking for the rest of the committee
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
but I my thought is that we were all
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
very concerned after all of that
 
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.950 align:start position:0%
very concerned after all of that
testimony

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
um my thought is the protection of the
 
00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:45.029 align:start position:0%
um my thought is the protection of the
child

00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
first um and the training and the
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
protection of the adult involved in the
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
incident as well so my thought is rather
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
than having surveillance cameras what
 
00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts about about having a
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
body Cam that the adult in the situation
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
could use it like a panic button when
 
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.549 align:start position:0%
could use it like a panic button when
the

00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
incident originates in the classroom
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
before we get to
 
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
seclusion the recording begins all the
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
way up to and including seclusion what
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts about that um I think
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
I think that might be a good idea I
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if anybody's ever done it I I
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
think the biggest thing about that and
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
again I don't see this in the in the
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
classroom I see this they're moved away
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
um into a and that's the thing is
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
they're moved away into a place where
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
nobody else is you I can guarantee you
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
you will not find a restraint in the
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
lunchroom in the front office you you're
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
not going to find it um and if you do
 
00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
it's very very rare um it that might be
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
something that you know all of a sudden
 
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
but I think that again you want to get
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
it right when it's way beginning so that
 
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
again you can prevent it from happening
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
again but that could be a really good
 
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
idea representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
chairman um just for my knowledge
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
purposes what how are they seclude or
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
sorry how are they restraining the
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
children because there's like an
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
infinite amount of ways to restrain
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
somebody so um I work in a hospital and
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
so we have like various methods um the
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
least restrictive would be like like a
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
vest or something um whereas the like a
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
little bit more restrictive would be
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
risk restraints but they're soft so
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
they're not going to cause like injury
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
if they're used properly um up to like
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
if someone's really being violent then
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
then there can be like leather
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
restraints so but that's Hospital based
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know what school-based is so
 
00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
School based is usually hand it's
 
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
Hands-On um so it's you know it's not
 
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
MediCal it's not um you know any type of
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
drug or anything like that and I've
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
never seen any equipment you it's
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
Hands-On and it's um
 
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.039 align:start position:0%
typically so I have seen um again and
 
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
this is the most scariest one in the
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
prone prone and when you're not supposed
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
to do prone but I have seen it um so
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
prone is you know face down holding them
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
down and then I don't forget my daughter
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
knows them all um there's a basket hold
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
in all of these but um the ones where
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
you're really being held down and if you
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
think so you know just a little this is
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
what happens to our brains in our brains
 
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519 align:start position:0%
we have an amydala that goes off and
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
says fight a flight we could all go into
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
fight a flight if we were walking down
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
the street in Boston and somebody came
 
00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
after us that's what we would do and
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
there's a being sometimes set off
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
quickly and it takes about 20 minutes
 
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
but what happens is if you're now
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
holding down this person you're now
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
increasing the length of the um of the
 
00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
of the escalation because they
 
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
continuing to be in fight or flight um
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
so there I would
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
say I I would say you know underneath
 
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
the arms and and um being held down but
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
typically than being brought into a
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
seclusion room to sit there and try to
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
deescalate yourself and it and you know
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
it's such a catch 22 all right you don't
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
want anything in the room that they
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
could hurt themselves in but then again
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
you put them in a padded room with the
 
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
door and and people will tell you that
 
00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
they don't lock the door I'm going to
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
tell you I had one principal say this is
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
what we do and this is in the last year
 
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
and he put his foot up against the door
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
there's no lock there but this is what I
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
do I put the foot I put my foot against
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
the door so the child can't come out and
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
those are the things that we want to see
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
you know because um and then the the
 
00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:54.519 align:start position:0%
adults are going into fight or flight
 
00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:56.919 align:start position:0%
too when this happens like we go oh my
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
goodness there's something horrible
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
going on right so again it and there's
 
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:04.519 align:start position:0%
tends to be everybody has patterns of
 
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
behavior so it tends to be so a kid
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
might go I hate this or this is stupid
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
and that begins this whole chain of
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
events that if not dealt with over here
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
it tends to go all the way down there
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
and honestly for children it becomes
 
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable and I did have one student
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
who was restrained over 300 times in one
 
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
year who would walk off the bus and try
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
to get himself restrained so be done so
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
we could just get it out and know that
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay and then move on from the day so in
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
other words the the injuries are are
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
from hands and stuff so they're usually
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
like on the forearms y or trying to get
 
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
trying to get away and then they fall
 
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
and they bump their head because they're
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
trying to get away because if anybody's
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
holding you down you're trying to get
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
away right and then and people will say
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
well you know they weren't they weren't
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
staying still um well they're not going
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
to they're they're you know Young And
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're feeling that they're
 
00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
going to be held and and they know after
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
the first time they know what's
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
happening they know the routine okay
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you you're
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
welcome any other questions for Miss
 
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
Tracy yeah chairman long thank you Mr
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
chairman so of the uh IEP
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
students are there restraints or
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
seclusions for somebody who's not in I I
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh I typically only see that maybe if
 
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
somebody has like a 504 um um you you
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
don't I I have not experienced a typical
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
student getting restraint or or
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
seclusion have not experienced that um
 
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
if that does that usually triggers to
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
start doing an evaluation for what we
 
00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:45.799 align:start position:0%
call invisible disabilities right and
 
00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
those tend to not to come out actually
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes until we get to school so here
 
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
you are a parent thinking everything's
 
00:31:54.269 --> 00:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
okay and then you bring them into school
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
and then they're not responding in the
 
00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:57.559 align:start position:0%
environment so that's what I typically
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
say I have never in my life looking at
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
data or information or observed a
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
typical student being restrained or
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
secluded right so us this committee's
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
concentrating on IEP wouldn't wouldn't
 
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
be a disservice that that that should be
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
what we're yeah I don't think yeah and
 
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
again in in this language here it says
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
that that to put it in an IEP any parent
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
can have that already put in an IEP but
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
this is the problem that most parents
 
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
aren't educated and I'll tell you
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
parents are embarrassed who wants to
 
00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:31.559 align:start position:0%
tell anybody that their kids having a
 
00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:33.559 align:start position:0%
behavior problem and needed to be held
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
down or restrained at school they're not
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
telling people that and and um so then
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
they just sit there and especially the
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
lower so socio economics you know that's
 
00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
they're embarrassed and ashamed of it
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to you know they may
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
even go home and now they're getting in
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
trouble again because of what happened
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much Miss Trace we
 
00:33:03.549 --> 00:33:03.559 align:start position:0%
do appreciate it thank you thank you for
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
telling me is there anyone else who
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
would like to come forward and just add
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
some insights uh to this uh
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
issue okay seeing none I'll uh entertain
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh discussion among committee members I
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
know two members in particular who have
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
some things that they do want to share
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
um representative Damon you had some
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts you wanted to share
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
specifically regarding body cameras and
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
we had our researcher go out and do some
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
research in that
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
regard yes thank you Mr chair um we uh
 
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.470 align:start position:0%
regard yes thank you Mr chair um we uh
you

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
did um I did ask you and you did comply
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
with uh asking our researcher to get the
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
information that we all have on body
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.509 align:start position:0%
 
surveillance

00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
surveillance
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
cameras in
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
schools where the incidences may
 
00:34:07.919 --> 00:34:09.829 align:start position:0%
schools where the incidences may
happen

00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
like all incidences where kids have to
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
be restrains restrained don't always
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
happen in the classroom they might
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
happen in the locker room they might
 
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
happen in the bathroom and if you're
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
having surveillance cameras in there
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to be seeing things
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
that no nobody really should
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
see so again it's my concern that other
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
students who are going to school able to
 
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
get through their academic
 
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
Day end the school day and go home are
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
going to be on these surveillance
 
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:50.919 align:start position:0%
cameras and their
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
privacy is infringed
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
upon on the other hand the kids who go
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
go to school and are not able to do that
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
because of whatever the reason are and
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
for every kid that can't get through the
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
school day you have a different reason
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
why they can't get through the school
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
day those kids need to be
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
protected in so far
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
as being able to report
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
Educators the parents and more
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
importantly their doctors
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
why what caused this kid to act out what
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
did the teacher or whomever else it was
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
in the school um what did they do to
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
help deescalate this child in and things
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
of that sort and what works and what
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't work it's all inclusive I
 
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.710 align:start position:0%
doesn't work it's all inclusive I
believe

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
in in educating that child and how that
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
child needs needs to be educated and I
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
think that a panic button in and of
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
itself is only going to bring a myriad
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
of people into the situation
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
which can escalate the situation not
 
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
deescalate the situation but a body cam
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
on a particular teacher that is used
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
like a panic button
 
00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
oh this child is getting tense acting
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
out boom push the panic button let's see
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
what we did right let's see what we did
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
wrong it's helping the child and it can
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
be used as a teaching tool for all
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
other Professionals in in the business I
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
hate having cameras and invading
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
anybody's privacy but I think in this
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
case it could help in that
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
respect representative Gibbons I think
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
has a question or a comment thank you um
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
yes just piggybacking off of what
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone said I
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from um
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
my concern would be the people that
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to push the body camera on uh
 
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
body camera like turn it on be for
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
whatever reason because
 
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
they I don't want to I don't want to
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
word it as want to be violent but they
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
they don't want their
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
actions seen because they don't want
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
reprimand or um or the situation might
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
be so highly escalated that they might
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
just innocently forget to turn it on so
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
I just I foresee problems if it manually
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
has to be turned on but I do see where
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
you're going where you don't necessarily
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
want to put
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
up um like cameras in bathrooms but you
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
might end up having a situation in a
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
bathroom so in other words I think that
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
a better solution might be to have the
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
body camera but not always to rely on it
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
um and have like the cameras in the room
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
that are kind of always
 
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:17.079 align:start position:0%
surveilling so that they really only
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
have to push the button if they're in
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
like a predicament like in a bathroom or
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
something like that and that there might
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
be consequences for the staff member if
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
they don't turn it on when they should
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
have um but that even that gets hairy
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
because like like what I was just saying
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
if the if the situation is that highly
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
escalated they might just instantly
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
forget to turn it on so to me it's a
 
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
catch 22 um where I just don't know what
 
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
the best solution is but I but I do see
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
it representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
I agree with both of you
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
and I just have um another um spin on on
 
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
recording so I did some research and I
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
shared with you guys yesterday um there
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
are three states who do have laws um
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
regarding videoing and they're all
 
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
specific to the use of cameras in in
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
special education settings in the
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
special education rooms only um and I
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
think that they all are not mandatory so
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
it would be they you know
 
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:31.640 align:start position:0%
May or could be wrong um on that part
 
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
but um we also had um some states um
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
Louisiana New Jersey Massachusetts New
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
York and Florida who who had bills and
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
they were not passed
 
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.829 align:start position:0%
they were not passed
um

00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:46.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
and um I don't have that much
 
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
information on why they did not pass I
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
apologize about
 
00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:58.839 align:start position:0%
that um so we do have some some um you
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
know prior statutes and other states
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
that we can kind of look at too thank
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
you for doing that
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
research representative Raymond I think
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
my concern is the expense I'm just
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about the expense of body
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
cameras I know like when NASA initially
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
got body cameras for our police force it
 
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.710 align:start position:0%
got body cameras for our police force it
was

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
$350,000 a year and our police force is
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh orders of magnitude less than our
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
staff at school um like 100 times less
 
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
than the number of people we would need
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
them for staff at school um so I just
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
cannot imagine in a place where we're
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
having difficulty finding and paying par
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
Educators um that school districts would
 
00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
have the money to do something like this
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm actually not opposed to expanding
 
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
U video cameras uh we already have them
 
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
in classrooms and Hall in hallways not
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
not typically classrooms but hallways
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
cafeteras other you know um main areas
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
in many of the high schools across the
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
state um so I could see expanding them
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
to certain other areas um but I I worry
 
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
about the Practical parts of it the
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
money and to spend enormous expense
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
investing in these things maintaining
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
them and
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
then not to spend enormous amounts of
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
money on the training and the
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and the retention of people
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
who do have the develop the skills and
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
then maintain the skills to react more
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately I just feel like when we
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
have a limited pool of money you put the
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
pool of money into teaching the skills
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
not you know buying
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
cameras representative
 
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman uh so in my
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
mind there's no doubt that video and
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
audio would be the best
 
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.670 align:start position:0%
audio would be the best
um

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
um however it's what will add video and
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
audio capture uh and it's putting the
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
teacher um you know there's there's
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
there's another thing they've got to
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
remember is not only do I got to deal
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
with this how am I going to deal with
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
this oh I got to turn this on you know
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know those are the liabilities that
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
that I question uh in I would think body
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
cams you could get a body Cam that
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a wide range you know it
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
would have a you know it would have a
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
direct range where you're not getting
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
other kids or what have you um um so
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
that in my mind that would be the best
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
now with respect to these forms are they
 
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
District drafted or is it uh the
 
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh so we took the technical
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
advisory from the State Department of
 
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
Education and um put it into our
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
computer system but I believe most of
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
the state has the same essential facts
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
that are being required the um the
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education made the
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
technical advisory it just didn't come
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
out until March so school districts
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
haven't had a long time to um create
 
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
their own forms integrate it into their
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
technology and then get it out to
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
everybody um and does somebody review
 
00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:16.559 align:start position:0%
those forms so I don't know what the
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
rule is everywhere um in nashaa our
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
policy that the school board passed
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
requires that um somebody like the
 
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
building level principal administrator
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
has to review them and that um that the
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh superintendent's office also has to
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
review them um because we
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
wanted I was very affected by some of
 
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
the testimony here um and I'm was very
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
um disheartened to see the number of
 
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
restraints and seclusions in some of the
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
schools um so we wanted to make sure
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
that there were multiple eyes looking at
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
these things um and that parents were
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
having multiple communication from the
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
school um about what was happening but
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
again we we started training the staff
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
I'm saying we I had nothing to do with
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
it they started training the staff um
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
over the summer for the you know the
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
back to school stuff but the school's
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
only been in session for five days The
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
Kindergartners just started yesterday um
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware yet of you know what what
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
seclusions have happened um the other
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
thing that that came out in our local
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
discussion about restraint and seclusion
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
is as the national board of ed really
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to dive into this topic um was
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know what constitutes a restraint
 
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
and seclusion and the interpretation of
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
our board was if a child is running away
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
on the playground right and they need to
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
be stopped so they don't run into
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
traffic that is a restraint in seclusion
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
because we it's not seclusion it's a
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
restraint we've stopped the child if you
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
have kids who are fighting in the
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
hallway at the high school and they are
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
separated by administrators that
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
qualifies as an incident of restraint
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
and seclusion and staff should be using
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
this form and informing all the parties
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
so we made our definition more broad
 
00:45:07.549 --> 00:45:07.559 align:start position:0%
than what was presented here today so
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm also uh just to close I'm also
 
00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:12.559 align:start position:0%
thinking that audio and
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
video um can be um you know if if it
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
happens to capture other students then
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
uh you know that could be somebody could
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
go over that and and and get rid of the
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
you know block off or what have you um
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
and as far as finances I'm not even
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
concerned about that what is and I in my
 
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
mind what is the best and then let
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
people in finance figure out if we got
 
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
that right representative Gibbons and
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
then representative Nelson thank you um
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
as far as the financial part uh we could
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
put into the bill like a stepup plan um
 
00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
because you know the the financial
 
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
portion of it says it's
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
indeterminable um so once they realize
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
what like what the actual cost and do an
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
assessment is we could just put in there
 
00:46:12.549 --> 00:46:12.559 align:start position:0%
that they have like X number of years to
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
to get it fully implemented and just do
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
what they can you know in the meantime
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
also they don't have to get the most
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
expensive cameras out there that you
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
know in this day and age there's like
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
you can shop on Amazon and there's
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
cameras that are extremely cheap that
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
work very well well um and assuming that
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
there's decent Wi-Fi you know you can
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
just connect it to the Wi-Fi and you
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
know I so in other words you just don't
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
they they there are ways to minimize the
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
costs and if they if we did a step up
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
plan to it then um then that might work
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
that might be a solution also just want
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
to go back to um Point number two uh the
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
part in italics uh it says prior to the
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
use of and immediately after we could
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
change that to or knowing that sometimes
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
it might be impossible to notify them
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
prior to you know in in the best case
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
solution like like what the testimony we
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
just heard where the the kindergartener
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
just didn't want to put their hands in
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
the paint um and was getting like
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
escalated because of that you know sure
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
they they would have the time to contact
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
the parent prior to but if it's a fight
 
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
in the hallway they're not going to
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily have time to you know so so
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
we can be realistic about this and
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
and just change that to
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
or because prior to is sometimes
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
impossible representative
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman um in the
 
00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
Texas law um it provides that the
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
cameras may be funded through the
 
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
solicitation or acceptance of gifts
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
grants and donations
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
ations and that um you know that might
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
be something that could be considered as
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
well um to defay the
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
cost and and representative long
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
actually it's another subject oh okay
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
just in that regard I mean I do agree
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
with representative long that our
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
concern is not finances we're all about
 
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
policy and then finances got to deal
 
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
with it but I am concerned about
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates on the local level
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
because every school district is
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
different and some are really struggling
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
with finances and others are not so any
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
kind of financing that comes down in my
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
view needs to come from the state or
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
through through grants but that's just
 
00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
my two cents no pun intended regarding
 
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
long chairman the the
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
um so what I'm what I'm thinking here is
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
that the the
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
IEP would have a plan that would allow
 
00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:58.799 align:start position:0%
you so there could somebody in the IEP
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
that would say no I don't want my child
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
recorded at any time correct so this
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
would be only for people who said yes
 
00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:11.079 align:start position:0%
that would that would work okay so so I
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
you know I don't
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
know what those percentages are I you
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
know I don't know how many parents would
 
00:49:21.549 --> 00:49:21.559 align:start position:0%
say at no at no uh moment do I want my
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
child um recorded or audio um okay so so
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's not it may not as be as bad as what
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
we're thinking you know it may be just a
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
few more kids
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
um you know again if we could just get
 
00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.910 align:start position:0%
um you know again if we could just get
over

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
the you know what's the liability for a
 
00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:49.799 align:start position:0%
power and not turning it on
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
or it happens to be tilted for some
 
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
reason and I'm filming her instead of
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
him right you know I mean um you know
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
those are the only things that I I would
 
00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
like to see a protection there um you
 
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
know and then you're GNA get somebody
 
00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.710 align:start position:0%
know and then you're GNA get somebody
who's

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
who's
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
saying I've had it up to here I'm not
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
turning this on because I'm not going to
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
do some good things you know what I mean
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know and that's you know how how how
 
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
do you figure
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
that representative Nelson thank you um
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
I I I'm feeling the same way as
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
representa of long I like the idea of
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
body cams but for those Reasons I'm
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
thinking um you know the the cameras in
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
the special ed classroom only
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
um might
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
be something to think about too um I do
 
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
know that um we have um a lot of push
 
00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
back about cameras in classrooms because
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
of um concerns of private and privacy in
 
00:50:57.309 --> 00:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
the workplace for the teachers concerns
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
about privacy um of parents for their
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
children um but we do have um these
 
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
three states that have made it work so
 
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
in this only in the special education
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
rooms okay any other thoughts to
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
share all right seeing none the question
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
now is how do we go forward so needless
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
to say the uh H uh uh HB 1269 expired
 
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:28.839 align:start position:0%
when the session by it so it's for us to
 
00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not we want to fire
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
legislation any one of us can fire
 
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
legislation representatives of a similar
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
mindset might decide that they want to
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
sit down and coordinate and draw up
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
something that ultimately can be
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
presented again listening to discussion
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we have all different
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
ideas and concerns and we're not really
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
at a a place where we have a consensus
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking a little bit maybe cameras
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
definitely there needs to be some more
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh teacher training um funding is a
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
question not necessarily for us because
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
that's not our priew so um is there
 
00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
anyone who uh wishes to take the lead in
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
terms of um maybe drafting
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
something or do you wish to come back
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
and have further discussion so I'm open
 
00:52:15.309 --> 00:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
to uh anything because this is this is
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
challenging no doubt yeah so so I if I
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
could uh thank you Mr chairman um I mean
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
can can we take a discussion uh could we
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
take a consensus on camera use I mean I
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
I you know I mean there's a lot of um
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
scenarios that would go with my approval
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
of that um but you know I mean I'm
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
thinking of being a parent and not
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
knowing why my kid has a
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
Shiner you know and and and you know the
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
parent tells me I'm not sure how that
 
00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
happened you know and it could be
 
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.150 align:start position:0%
happened you know and it could be
legitimate

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
um so audio and video is the best way we
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
have audio and video today you know it's
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's not
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
Antiquated um like you said there are
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
small videos and you know we could zoom
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
in on the child and the
 
00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
par um so I I you know uh so I don't
 
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
know where we'd go
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
on a greant with speculation you know
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
with contingencies on using uh camera
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
and audio for the par
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
um would we consider that would be the
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
question yeah what directions I'm
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
thinking of this bill and has it relates
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
to the parent from a parent I'm not
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
knowing what's going on I'm upset um and
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
and the best way to know is the show uh
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
because even if I tell I don't believe
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
you you know you get into that CIO you
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
know or if I look at the form is
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
everything on the form well I don't know
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
you know maybe they had to fill out six
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
um so yeah representative Gibbons I mean
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
I think we're all in agreement I people
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
can speak up if they're not but that in
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
general this is good it's just Minor
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
Details uh that we're trying to figure
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
out so I mean I do think we should
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
probably just revise those Minor Details
 
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
and and maybe submit it again for the
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know for the next for
 
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:44.910 align:start position:0%
you know for the next for
2025

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
um well my suggestion in that regard if
 
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
we were to do that i' I'd like us to
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
review whatever is put forth because
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's going to come before the
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
full committee so I'd like us to have a
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
a handle on anything that's put forth
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
before it comes to us formally when
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're in session that's just my thought
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
in that regard right so so can can we do
 
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.230 align:start position:0%
in that regard right so so can can we do
a

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
report uh has to um you know we agree
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
that this should be brought forward and
 
00:55:12.839 --> 00:55:14.150 align:start position:0%
that this should be brought forward and
further

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
legislation uh couple of the discussions
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
were the cameras contingent
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
upon you know the focus on the child and
 
00:55:26.109 --> 00:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
the parent not the child sitting next to
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
him or whatever uh same with same with
 
00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:32.230 align:start position:0%
him or whatever uh same with same with
audio

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
audio
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
um uh I mean you know in my mind fixing
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
the parent
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
knowing seeing is going to give them the
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
best Comfort this is yeah you know maybe
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
you'll see something that happened that
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't written down we didn't see it you
 
00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
know representative Raymond so I just I
 
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
still am
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
not comfortable with idea of putting
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
body cameras on teachers I'm just not I
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
mean I think we have discussions at this
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
at you know the state level about
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should arm teachers
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
and now we have discussions about body
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
camera teachers and I just feel like we
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
might as well just have police officers
 
00:56:11.549 --> 00:56:11.559 align:start position:0%
do it since we're going to also have
 
00:56:13.029 --> 00:56:13.039 align:start position:0%
discussions about what books teachers
 
00:56:16.829 --> 00:56:16.839 align:start position:0%
can teach like at some point we have
 
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
to we have to let professionals be
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
professional having said that I'm not
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
opposed to having recordings of
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
incidents and I think child protection
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
is important and I think it's Paramount
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
um there is in law already under the
 
00:56:35.789 --> 00:56:35.799 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes for wire tapping a
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
whole section about how audio and video
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
recordings are supposed to happen on
 
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
school buses and how that gets approved
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
by the school like it has to go through
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
the school board um and how uh who's
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to access it and how long it can
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
be you know retained and I think that if
 
00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about adding a audio
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
and video recording elsewhere like we
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
really ought to start looking at some of
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
those statutes as opposed to trying to
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
create something new out of you know
 
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
cobbling stuff together yeah so yes yeah
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we're not we're not looking at uh
 
00:57:17.069 --> 00:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not looking at something
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
new we're not even going to put in the
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
language that some legislative may put
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
in we we're just given what our
 
00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
discussions were um
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding is this is in special
 
00:57:31.029 --> 00:57:31.039 align:start position:0%
ed classrooms
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
only um so so we're not having all
 
00:57:39.309 --> 00:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
teachers wear body cams um it's it's
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's just suited for this uh and it's
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
specific to children that can't
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
communicate so I don't know if if I was
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
to bring legislator forward I would
 
00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.470 align:start position:0%
to bring legislator forward I would
exemp

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
exemp
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
um children that can communicate you
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
know I you know so so I mean
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the bottom line to me is how
 
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
do I assure a parent that they
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
know everything that happened the best
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
way is showing just uh um a bit
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
regarding uh what the comment you made
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
the uh bill as presented does not
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
specify special ed classrooms but
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
students who have IEPs and they're
 
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
mainstreamed and so this legislation
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
would imply that cameras would be
 
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
everywhere so when we go forth if we are
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
to talk about surveillance I'm hearing
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
from you that it would be specific to
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
classrooms representative Nelson I agree
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
with um representative Long's concerns
 
00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
and I I have to say just personal
 
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
experience um both of my biological
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
children unfortunately have inherited
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
the clumsy Gene for me and um they've
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
come home with with bumps on the head
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
and fat lip um and it's just cuz they're
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
clumsy and they you know leaned over and
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
hit their face on the desk or whatever
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
but the report that you get from the
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
school nurse or the teacher whomever um
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
calls me at home can
 
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
be um cooperated by the child right so
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
you know hey I got a phone call from the
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
nurse today what
 
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
happened matching up and it's the same
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
thing right but these kids cannot do
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
that and um that is um a huge concern
 
00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.029 --> 00:59:40.039 align:start position:0%
too any other thoughts of
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
discussion okay so so hearing none
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
um do I take it representative long that
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
you might be inclined to draft something
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
I don't want to put that on you but just
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
and other like-minded individuals
 
01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
you know we're not going to put in
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
language that we would do if we were
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
putting in legislation because we would
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
look at what representative uh
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
umay Raymond uh you know look at the
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
other statutes and then it may not come
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
to Children of family it may go to
 
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
education right you know um but yeah
 
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.150 align:start position:0%
education right you know um but yeah
just

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
just note what we discussed and and what
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
we were made aware of and what we would
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
recommend and then let them take it from
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
there okay so representative thison
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
actually made a motion that uh
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative long draw up a report
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
vote on that and we don't have to vote
 
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
on that just uh uh representative
 
01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:14.039 align:start position:0%
dione's microphone was off so I just
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that clear for the
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
record and uh so that's that's good to
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
know so that's where we're going to go
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
uh forward and um when do we anticipate
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
maybe this would be done and we should
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
reconvene another meeting do we want to
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
set a date now for that or just wait
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
till you get back and we can formally
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
announce that later what's today
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
Wednesday so by by next next week okay
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
and then actually if you give me a date
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
if you give me a date when we're going
 
01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.549 align:start position:0%
if you give me a date when we're going
to

01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
meet that'll tell you when I'm going to
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
write this up all right all right well
 
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
let's let's do that let's just take a
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
look at our calendars and we'll get back
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
to each other very very quickly and and
 
01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
we'll let representative long know
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
and then we can we can schedule we can
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
schedule another another time to meet so
 
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
it'll only be a review of the
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
recommendation yes representative uh uh
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
Gibbons I just want to repeat that I
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
think it's important for the prior use
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
of comma and immediately after to be
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
changed to or as part of the
 
01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:20.039 align:start position:0%
recommendation um I know that that's a
 
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:21.640 align:start position:0%
minor detail but I think it's
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
significant and and uh what do you guys
 
01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
think of I I have issues with uh you
 
01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
know asum as practical that that leaves
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
the door open for yeah so not they could
 
01:02:36.269 --> 01:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
say they could specify uh how many hours
 
01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
that I mean in
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
the in the um Hospital like if we were
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
had to put someone in restraints we have
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
like a certain amount of time before we
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
have to let the doctor know and get an
 
01:02:50.829 --> 01:02:50.839 align:start position:0%
order so it is possible that they could
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
say like you have one hour to notify the
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
family after um someone had to be
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
restrained so you know and and that
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
would come back to a staff training
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
issue where they would have to be
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
notified that that's the new uh policy
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
so okay wonderful so before we adjourn I
 
01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
do want to uh remind everyone that on
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
Monday September 23rd uh The Joint
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
Office of the child advocate in Waypoint
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
um is going to have a documentary SC
 
01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:28.839 align:start position:0%
screening of the kids we lose and I
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
think everyone did receive this card
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
there was also a mailing as well as an
 
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
email so I'll be in attendance uh
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
followed by a um panel discussion with
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
Dr Ross green and um the documentary
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's award-winning documentary and it
 
01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
deals with the topic that we are
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
currently grappling with so I think
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
that's important for us to take a look
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
at that might uh assist us as we move
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
forward and we all know that we can file
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislation in November so we still have
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
plenty of time uh moving forward so with
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
that if I hear no other questions or
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
comments or thoughts I guess we'll
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
adjourn and I wait to hear an email of a
 
01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
definitive time when we'll meet again
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%

01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:14.039 align:start position:0%
