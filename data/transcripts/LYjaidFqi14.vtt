00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh so the today's
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
executive session is going to deal with
 
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.370 align:start position:0%
executive session is going to deal with
the

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
the nine bills that we move to put into
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
interim study uh the only motions that
 
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
we'll be entertaining today on each one
 
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
of these bills is do we recommend for
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
future legislation or do we not
 
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
um I did put the onus on the prime
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill when we decided to
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
go interim study
 
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
and just as a footnote and I decide
 
00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:20.459 align:start position:0%
we're going to believe we'll take them
 
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
up in order this is completely
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
unrehearsed and so we do have a quorum
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
and I guess we'll get going uh I'll open
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
up the executive session on interim
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm not totally sure
 
00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:50.339 align:start position:0%
what the exact wording is but I move not
 
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
 
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.829 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
if

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
you can remind me of the actual terms
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
okay yeah hold on one second
 
00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:02.339 align:start position:0%
amen is there a second
 
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'll second
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh I saw representative Fox first
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
would you care to speak to your motion
 
00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:14.630 align:start position:0%
would you care to speak to your motion
sure

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
um 522 speaks to
 
00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:23.150 align:start position:0%
um 522 speaks to
um

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
extending the requirement for
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
inspections to a longer period of time
 
00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:32.579 align:start position:0%
for newer vehicles or vehicles that are
 
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
still under warranty now what we came
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
out of the public hearing with is that
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
there were lots of undefined terms
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
we had lots of testimony on the variable
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
use that can cars can have in that time
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
period from you know leaving the lot to
 
00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
two years in you could put five thousand
 
00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
miles on a car you can put a hundred
 
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
thousand miles on a car a lot of vehicle
 
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
inspections they look at those items
 
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
that wear out and use such as brakes
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
tires wipers that kind of thing and I
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
think we uh
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
heard convincing testimony that there's
 
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:16.139 align:start position:0%
just too much
 
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:18.200 align:start position:0%
open-ended questions
 
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
and that a one size fits all changed to
 
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
the vehicle inspection law just doesn't
 
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that anybody else from the
 
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.150 align:start position:0%
thank you for that anybody else from the
committee

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:40.139 align:start position:0%
I'll just say this I'm looking at the
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
the text of this actual bill as I said
 
00:13:44.329 --> 00:13:44.339 align:start position:0%
before I did put the onus on the prime
 
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
sponsors I have not heard a word
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
um and he was well aware of the issues
 
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
that were raised when we heard this
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm not necessarily opposed to making
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
a change for the first two years but I
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
don't know if we'll be ready for that I
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
started looking at some initial
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
information and trying to separate the
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
failure rate for for vehicles one in two
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
years old but it's going to re require
 
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
some more in-depth looking at so
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
I at this point have no issue uh with
 
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
the motion to
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
not recommend
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay just so you know too this is the
 
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
recommendation based on the language of
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
this bill it does not by any means tie
 
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
the hands of any legislator that wants
 
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
to go across the street to OLS and file
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
something anyway this is basically a
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
formality for the bills that we had left
 
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
over from this past year
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
that being said I'll ask the clerk to
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
call the roll the motion on the floor is
 
00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:50.459 align:start position:0%
to not recommend further legislation
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
hey representative gagne
 
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.030 align:start position:0%
hey representative gagne
yes

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
a clerk votes yes
 
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
I spend down my list uh representative
 
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.250 align:start position:0%
I spend down my list uh representative
Rambo

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
Rambo
 
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.269 align:start position:0%
Rambo
yes

00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative rich
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski yes
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
representative Fox yes
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
representative Ayo yes and chairman
 
00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:23.449 align:start position:0%
representative Ayo yes and chairman
Walsh

00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
Walsh
 
00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:26.990 align:start position:0%
Walsh
foreign

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
1901 nine to one
 
00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:40.019 align:start position:0%
that's just a look it will not be here
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
there will be not another minority
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
reports so so right now the
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation at this point and again
 
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
narrowly looking at the context of this
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
bill is to not recommend future
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
legislation so even if you think it's a
 
00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
good idea to move to a two-year
 
00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:55.810 align:start position:0%
good idea to move to a two-year
exemption

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:55.820 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
I'm looking more specifically at this
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
language I don't think it works it could
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
be another way to do it
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
so I have a question I have a question
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
um you just characterized what the vote
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
was for on that specific Bill about that
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
specific language in the bill
 
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
but but really I think what we're saying
 
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.269 align:start position:0%
but but really I think what we're saying
is

00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:32.810 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:37.019 align:start position:0%
my my Noble is that it is worthy of
 
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
future legislation not not that that
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is the correct
 
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is that not right
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
again it's open for interpretation I
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
agree with you
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
um as and again like I said at the
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
beginning concept wise
 
00:16:57.889 --> 00:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
I am not uh opposed to looking at a
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
two-year exemption on brand new vehicles
 
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.670 align:start position:0%
two-year exemption on brand new vehicles
either

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.990 align:start position:0%
either
but

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
with not having any support at the
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
beginning of this debate I figured I
 
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.429 align:start position:0%
beginning of this debate I figured I
would

00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:10.579 align:start position:0%
just to move things along go ahead with
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
non-recommendation or and and
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
again no hands are tied from this as we
 
00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
learn more things in the future
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh give me a moment next bill we'll look
 
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay I'll open up the executive session
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
on interim study build house bill 628
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
relative to maximum vehicle speed
 
00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:16.850 align:start position:0%
relative to maximum vehicle speed
limitations

00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
all speed limits in the state of New
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%

00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
hour on all types of most types of Roads
 
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
representative Hill uh thank you Mr

chairman I would move
um

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
not to recommend future legislation okay
 
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
so the Motions to not recommend future
 
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
legislation is that seconded is that
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to buy representative tolerski
 
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
anything to say
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
I recommend not
 
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we um we looked at this at the
 
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.510 align:start position:0%
yeah we um we looked at this at the
beginning

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.110 align:start position:0%
beginning
um

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:15.740 align:start position:0%
it's just too wide a scope to just
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
randomly raise everything
 
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
and then these days driving on a regular
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
basis knowing that if I do the speed
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
limit right now I'm actually a hazard I
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
don't know if this is the time to be
 
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
raising speed limits anywhere quite
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
honestly once again it does not stop
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
anybody from filing a bill if they can
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
find specific roadways that are
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
justifiable to raise
 
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
with nobody else I'll ask the clerk to
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
call the roll the motion is to not
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
okay so the committee vote is 10-0 to
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
not recommend future legislation
 
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.340 align:start position:0%

give us a couple of minutes and we'll
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
regroup we are going in order for what's
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
okay I'll open up the executive session
 
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
on interim study bill House Bill 1445 FN
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
relative to identification of police
 
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.330 align:start position:0%
relative to identification of police
vehicles

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is representative
 
00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:00.110 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is representative
trottier

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
trottier
 
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:01.940 align:start position:0%
I have heard nothing
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
in in addressing any of the concerns
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
I'll make that motion
 
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:18.419 align:start position:0%
with help afterwards and what motion is
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
that emotion is not recommended for
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
future legislation okay so the motion is
 
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
not recommend for future legislation is
 
00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:27.059 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
second by representative tolerski did
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
you wish to comment if
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
I don't have the bill before me because
 
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
I the dog ate my homework apparently
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh but I if I my memory serves me these
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
are the unmarked state police vehicles
 
00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:22:45.179 --> 00:22:47.630 align:start position:0%
who are
um

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
if you've got any kind of eyesight to
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
drive you can see that they're unmarked
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
and you can see the logo even though
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
it's hidden
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
and they have stake plates uh government
 
00:22:59.210 --> 00:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
plates on them I think they're
 
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.590 align:start position:0%
plates on them I think they're
identifiable

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
identifiable
 
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.930 align:start position:0%
identifiable
uh

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
I don't feel that
 
00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:09.299 align:start position:0%
I feel that the state police or with
 
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
these unmarked vehicles are doing a good
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
job catching those guys who are doing 80
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
90 miles an hour on the highways and
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
thinking that they can get away with it
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't like that very much so I'm
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
not recommending this for future
 
00:23:22.919 --> 00:23:25.669 align:start position:0%
not recommending this for future
legislation

00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.610 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
representative

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
I just have one comment that um I
 
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
believe this bill as written
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
specifically had a unfunded mandate that
 
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
the department would have to and local
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities I believe would have to
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
take the expense on themselves to
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
um redo all of the vehicles in their
 
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
Fleet which was a huge
 
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
um Financial undertaking so for that
 
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
matter until we figure out a way to deal
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
with that I'm I'm good with the
 
00:23:56.159 --> 00:23:58.029 align:start position:0%
with that I'm I'm good with the
recommendations

00:23:58.029 --> 00:23:58.039 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:03.500 align:start position:0%
seeing now the one thing I do remember
 
00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:06.419 align:start position:0%
that there wasn't I guess the one of the
 
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
main reasons for this bill being even
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
filed was that some some state police
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
vehicles do have a civilian plate that
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
they can run as well as their their
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
police plate
 
00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.570 align:start position:0%
police plate
um

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
I have seen them both being used there's
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
justifiable uh there's justification for
 
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
using the civilian plates in certain
 
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
circumstances and even if you see a
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
Dodge Charger
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
with civilian plates you might want to
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
take a look at the hubcaps it's a dead
 
00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
giveaway so I don't see any need for
 
00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
future legislation here either
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank you and that being said if there's
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
nobody else who has to clerk to call the
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
roll the motion is to not recommend
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh Vice chairman gagne yes
 
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes
 
00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:00.539 align:start position:0%
representative Hill yes
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski yes representative
 
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.430 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski yes representative
Rambo

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
Rambo
 
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative Rich yeah yeah
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski yes
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative Fox yes representative
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
yes chairman Walsh
 
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.950 align:start position:0%
yes chairman Walsh
yes

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
so the recommendation for no
 
00:25:23.409 --> 00:25:23.419 align:start position:0%
recommendation is 10-0
 
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
I'm forgetting to use this thing so I'll
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
close the executive session on House
 
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
Bill 1445
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
a few minutes please we'll go to 1464.
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
all right I'll open up the executive
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
session I would I was uh I missed
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
misspoke a minute ago I'm going to go to
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1447 in order prohibiting
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
state agencies from using face
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
recognition technology
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh Prime sponsors representative Maguire
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
this is I don't know if this qualifies
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
as a perennial bill yet but it's uh it's
 
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
been here many times
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
this is what happens when we go at it
 
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll make a motion okay
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski I'm gonna just
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that the language is correct
 
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
and act prohibiting state agencies so
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
I'd say yes I'd like to see this
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
recommend to move forward
 
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
the motion is to recommend future
 
00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:33.020 align:start position:0%
legislation is there a second
 
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
Ed by representative Hill
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
and he can care to discuss your motion
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
um when I remember we heard testimony on
 
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
this the whole thing about facial
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
recognition software is that it's
 
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.330 align:start position:0%
recognition software is that it's
relatively

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
new there's there are some areas where
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
there are still areas that it needs to
 
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
be improved on
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
and my view is with something like that
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
and keeping a database I'm really
 
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
concerned uh not only about civil
 
00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299 align:start position:0%
liberties but I'm also concerned with
 
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
the with the technology itself
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
so therefore I that's why I think we may
 
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
want to look forward to maybe future
 
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.590 align:start position:0%
want to look forward to maybe future
legislation

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.250 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:21.419 align:start position:0%
for fear of sounding like I'm confused
 
00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
to the motion
 
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
um based on our discussion previously
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
about this bill in particular is written
 
00:29:29.159 --> 00:29:30.230 align:start position:0%
about this bill in particular is written
um

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
I feel like there were many unanswered
 
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
questions on how this bill is written
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
would be applied uh
 
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
and I believe we were discussing earlier
 
00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
some of my colleagues and I
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
that when we had this public hearing we
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
were discussing the need for guard rails
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
very more specific
 
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
um wording on the use of the technology
 
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.529 align:start position:0%
um wording on the use of the technology
what

00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:57.539 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:29:57.539 --> 00:29:58.250 align:start position:0%
what
um

00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:00.299 align:start position:0%
the department is permitted or not
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
permitted to use
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
so with that I would have been hopeful
 
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
to actually dig deeper into this
 
00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.710 align:start position:0%
to actually dig deeper into this
um

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
so it
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
as long as I'm understanding the
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
guidelines correctly that we're talking
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
about this bill as written I would have
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
to vote no on the motion to recommend
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
passage on or recommend future
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
legislation based on this
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
fair enough and and referring to the
 
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
first bill when I did state that about
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
the bill specifically uh it's subjective
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh either way this is just a
 
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.909 align:start position:0%
uh either way this is just a
recommendation

00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.830 align:start position:0%
recommendation
uh

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
you can look at the bill itself and pick
 
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
it apart or not uh this is just do we
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
think it's even worth looking into and I
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
think most of us can say it's it's got
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
some Merit I'll leave it at that it's
 
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
entirely up to you which way you'd like
 
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
to vote any other discussions from
 
00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
anybody on the committee
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
seeing them I'll ask the clerk to call
 
00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
the roll the motion is to recommend
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
future legislation on House Bill 1447.
 
00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:12.059 align:start position:0%

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
six four so the motion to recommend
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
future legislation is adopted six four
 
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh that will close the executive session
 
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1447. and now a few
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:14.460 align:start position:0%

00:32:43.200 --> 00:33:03.769 align:start position:0%
 
huge

00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
session on interim study bill host Bill
 
00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
1464 establishing a committee to study
 
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
the feasibility and implementation of
 
00:33:16.009 --> 00:33:16.019 align:start position:0%
furthering electric vehicle adoption in
 
00:33:17.649 --> 00:33:17.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
uh the prime sponsor I believe is
 
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative Benton
 
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.350 align:start position:0%
representative Benton
yep

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative tolersky
 
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
I would like to make a motion to
 
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
recommend this for future legislation
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second
 
00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:43.019 align:start position:0%
okay it's been moved and seconded to
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation would you
 
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:50.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
we've had this
 
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
spirited debate many times in committee
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
on the role of this committee with the
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle industry
 
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
um the fact that this was a study
 
00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:05.870 align:start position:0%
um the fact that this was a study
committee

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
to determine how to
 
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.570 align:start position:0%
to determine how to
um

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
further electric vehicle adoption here
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
based on the information that right now
 
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
those vehicles are going to other states
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
first I see this as a business issue we
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
have dealerships here in New Hampshire
 
00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
that cannot get the vehicles that are in
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
demand by Granite Staters they're going
 
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
over the border to shop elsewhere and I
 
00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:36.500 align:start position:0%
think it would be in the best interest
 
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.109 align:start position:0%
think it would be in the best interest
of

00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
the state to at least take the time to
 
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
sit down and discuss the issue and see
 
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
what our role is in it and I feel that
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
this committee has not yet
 
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:49.669 align:start position:0%
this committee has not yet
um

00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
done that properly so I recommend this
 
00:34:56.089 --> 00:34:56.099 align:start position:0%
bill for future legislation Mr chairman
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gagne thank you
 
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
we already have a New Hampshire
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation council is doing this
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
very thing as a matter of fact we're
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
meeting October 12th
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
we're having a public hearing on all the
 
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
stuff that that this bill would
 
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.829 align:start position:0%
stuff that that this bill would
establish

00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
establish
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need two committees to
 
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
study it the council is very
 
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
comprehensive it's dealing uh
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Victoria Sheen is involved
 
00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:29.579 align:start position:0%
in it and in all
 
00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:32.420 align:start position:0%
all the big players are involved in this
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
including this small player here and to
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
me I think to set up another commission
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
or another committee is just a waste of
 
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
time this particular New Hampshire
 
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
Transportation council is taking in
 
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.950 align:start position:0%
Transportation council is taking in
everything

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
into play as far infrastructure Etc and
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
Etc and Etc so I don't think we need
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
another commission
 
00:35:59.810 --> 00:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just add my opinion if you
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
don't mind I do have to agree we have I
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
think two books about this thick with
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
all the established committees we don't
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
not need anymore especially knowing that
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
the council exists
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm also a firm believer in
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
the free market determining how these
 
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
things move forward not the government
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
and to keep it even simpler section
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
three room and one
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
study of the feasibility of adopting
 
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
regulations similar to the California
 
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
zero emission vehicle program I would
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
never vote for anything in the state of
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's got the word
 
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
California in it that being said anybody
 
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.750 align:start position:0%
California in it that being said anybody
else

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
the roll the motion is to recommend
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:56.569 --> 00:36:56.579 align:start position:0%
clerk votes no
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
representative Hill no
 
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski no
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo yes
 
00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:07.619 align:start position:0%
representative rich
 
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski yes
 
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Fox yes representative
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
yes and chairman Walsh nope it's five to
 
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
five no
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
six four
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
no it's five five
 
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.089 align:start position:0%
no it's five five
yeah

00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's five to five one two three four
 
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
five two three four five there's only
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
ten of us well that's interesting
 
00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
so well I mean I would imagine the same
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
rules apply uh in the tie the the motion
 
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.050 align:start position:0%
rules apply uh in the tie the the motion
fails

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
fails
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
and so I guess we can entertain another
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
motion but something tells me uh we know
 
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen there's
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
well that's true well usually we try one
 
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
of each if it's if if the motion the
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
second motion to not recommend fails
 
00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
then it would move forward with none
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
so let's give it a shot just to keep
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
keep all the bases covered is there
 
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
just to keep it keep all the ducks in a
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
row are there any other motions to this
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:25.010 align:start position:0%
 
hello

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
I don't have another paper
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
what we generally do in committee is go
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
we if the first motion fails we
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
entertain the positive motion or the
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
opposite motion if that fails as well
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
then it'll go on with no recommendation
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
I've only done we've only done half of
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
it I move the opposite I I move no
 
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
recommendation okay is there a second
 
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
yes okay so it's been moved and seconded
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
to not recommend future legislation I
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any more discussion
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen I'll ask the clerk
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman gagne
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
the motion is not recommended is that
 
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Hill yes representative
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo
 
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.670 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo
no

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
representative rich
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
Representative tulerski no
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
yep five to five I five okay so this
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
will move on with no recommendation I'll
 
00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
confirm that before we leave the
 
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
building but I don't see any other other
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
way to get this accomplished so I'll
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
close the executive session on House
 
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
Bill 1464.
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
okay I'll open up the executive session
 
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1615 relative to driver
 
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
education and the driver training fund
 
00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:58.460 align:start position:0%
um in summary
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsors representative Army the
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
bill director Department of Safety
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
distribute 250 to approved driver
 
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
schools for each pupil who completes the
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
driver education program in the prior
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
three months uh is there a motion for
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
either recommend or not recommended
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:26.339 align:start position:0%
sure representative Rambo I'd like to
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
move to not recommend for future
 
00:42:27.599 --> 00:42:29.150 align:start position:0%
move to not recommend for future
legislation

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
um I would like to say I think there's a
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
lot of good intention
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to support the underlying
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
concept bill but we're not doing that
 
00:42:38.329 --> 00:42:38.339 align:start position:0%
right now okay
 
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
but there's just too many problems I
 
00:42:40.609 --> 00:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
think as we talked about when we were in
 
00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
session before so thank you
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
so it's been moved and seconded to not
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation any other
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
discussion from the committee Rumbo yep
 
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I just um
 
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.810 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I just um
I

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:42:59.210 --> 00:42:59.220 align:start position:0%
admire representative All Me for filing
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
the the bill
 
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
to try to tackle the challenges that we
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
have with the driver education program
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I think there were obvious problems
 
00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:11.579 align:start position:0%
that she knew existed right from the
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
get-go when she presented the bill she
 
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
came right out and said we need to study
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
this further
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a little unfortunate we
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have the chance to dig into this
 
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:21.829 align:start position:0%
didn't have the chance to dig into this
one

00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that money from the driver
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
training fund should go to driver
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
education schools we have to figure out
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
how to do that without
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
um hitting this I think it's the state
 
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
police correct yeah in the pocketbook so
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
we need to figure this out but I agree
 
00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:38.339 align:start position:0%
that um I think we all agreed with the
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor that has written it was
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
not going to do what she wanted it to do
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
so I'll support the motion
 
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
fair enough and I forgot about that but
 
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
you're right this not recommend does
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
have the support of the sponsor so
 
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:43:53.809 --> 00:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
CNN I'll ask the clerk called the roll
 
00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:56.579 align:start position:0%
the motion is to not recommend future
 
00:43:59.089 --> 00:43:59.099 align:start position:0%
legislation at this time
 
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:01.740 align:start position:0%

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
is adopted 10-0 uh I'll close the
 
00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:32.060 align:start position:0%

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes penalties for
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
newly established residents failing to
 
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
abide by New Hampshire driver's license
 
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.910 align:start position:0%
abide by New Hampshire driver's license
requirements

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
I'm starting to remember this there was
 
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
some interest in this bill and I believe
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State also
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
was looking at this favorably or at
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
least in concept so is there a motion on
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
00:46:59.089 --> 00:46:59.099 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
I make a motion that this is not
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
 
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
second of my representative so the
 
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is to not recommend
 
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
future legislation uh any would you care
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
to speak to your mom sure quickly
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
um This was
 
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.650 align:start position:0%
um This was
um

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
a very complicated bill in terms of the
 
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
um requirements upon the DMV to
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
follow up on the residency issue it's
 
00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:38.339 align:start position:0%
tightly related to
 
00:47:40.089 --> 00:47:40.099 align:start position:0%
voting issues
 
00:47:44.089 --> 00:47:44.099 align:start position:0%
the testimony from the DMV was as
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
written there were many unanswered
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
questions about how it was going to be
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
enforced how they would fulfill the
 
00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
requirements in this bill I believe it
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
was Ms chute that said it was just
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
unclear all around how the DMV would
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
Implement any of this and but the one
 
00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:05.660 align:start position:0%
thing that really stuck with me was
 
00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:08.339 align:start position:0%
that this is really imposing motor
 
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
vehicle law on those who may not be
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
driving because it Flags people who um
 
00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.089 align:start position:0%
driving because it Flags people who um
vote

00:48:17.089 --> 00:48:17.099 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
with an expired license or an
 
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
out-of-state license which it is legal
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
to do in the state of New Hampshire so I
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
just think that overall there were far
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
too many
 
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.670 align:start position:0%
too many
questions

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
then it actually solving any problem
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
well the one thing I'll say I'll just
 
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
chime in a moment as I told you all
 
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:39.829 align:start position:0%
chime in a moment as I told you all
before

00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
I put the onus on the prime sponsors of
 
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
these bills to address some of the
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
issues that we had and I remember it was
 
00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.890 align:start position:0%
issues that we had and I remember it was
complicated

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
um again though this is the only
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
exception to the other all the nine I
 
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
know this Prime sponsor has been working
 
00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
on addressing some of the issues we're
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
an executive session now so it's
 
00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
improper for me to to pull them in front
 
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
of the committee but but again we're
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
just talking about future legislation
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
and whether it's worthy uh knowing the
 
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
work that's been done on behalf of the
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor I'm not going to support
 
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
the non-recommendation at this time so
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
if there's nobody else I'll ask the
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the roll
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none and the motion that
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
we're voting on right now is to not
 
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation
 
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:32.940 align:start position:0%

all right I'll open up the executive
 
00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:30.059 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 1658 relative to
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
testing in lieu of license renewal fees
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor representative Abramson
 
00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
this bill allows an individual to take a
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
written test in lieu of paying for
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
paying a fee to renew their driver's
 
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.809 align:start position:0%
paying a fee to renew their driver's
license

00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh is there a motion
 
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
to either recommend or not recommend
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative been quiet all day
 
00:53:59.089 --> 00:53:59.099 align:start position:0%
I I think this one's even got your name
 
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
I would move to not recommend thank you
 
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
is there a second I will second second
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
putting you on the spot
 
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
um I just think this is kind of not
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
ready I like the concept but uh I don't
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
know that it's feasible financially I
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
think it would be very costly to
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
administer this for free to to Residents
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
and uh think financially it doesn't make
 
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
I have to agree with you and I don't
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
know how much there is really to talk
 
00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
about it I don't actually even quite
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
understand it anybody else from the
 
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.390 align:start position:0%

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:52.460 align:start position:0%

um Prime sponsors Senator Waters again
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
this is the Senate bill it had been
 
00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate
 
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh this bill prohibits non-resident
 
00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:03.109 align:start position:0%
uh this bill prohibits non-resident
employed

00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
employed
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
this bill prohibits a non-resident
 
00:57:06.049 --> 00:57:06.059 align:start position:0%
employed New Hampshire through the
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%

00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
vehicle unless they possess license
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
issued by another U.S jurisdiction or
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
meet other listed requirements
 
00:57:19.849 --> 00:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
if you remember we did a lot of work on
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
this prior to deciding for interim study
 
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
some conversations have occurred since
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll leave it at that is their
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
emotion whether to recommend future
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
I would move uh yes to Future
 
00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.829 align:start position:0%
I would move uh yes to Future
legislation

00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
motion is to recommend future
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
legislation is there a second
 
00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
I knew you'd be surprised
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
so would you care to speak to motion
 
00:58:03.839 --> 00:58:05.630 align:start position:0%
so would you care to speak to motion
no

00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
and I knew you were going to say that
 
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh again like I said we did genuinely
 
00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:14.579 align:start position:0%
work on this uh I said it at the time
 
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
when we executed the first time that
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
every time we answered a question we
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
found uh another one and so
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
we have been speaking with directive
 
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles in the meantime
 
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:27.950 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles in the meantime
um

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
to continue the discussion as well as
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
the the motor vehicles has tried to make
 
00:58:35.329 --> 00:58:35.339 align:start position:0%
it easier for the for the farmers up
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
north that were affected and actually
 
00:58:38.809 --> 00:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
bringing this complaint forward
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
uh I'll go one step further I've been
 
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
trying to confirm but I believe a
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
different or similar version to this and
 
00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:50.579 align:start position:0%
to keep it moving uh will probably be
 
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
coming out of the Senate this year again
 
00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
by a different Senator I just haven't
 
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
been able to confirm so I have no
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
opposition to continuing the
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
conversation to try to solve this I'll
 
00:59:04.089 --> 00:59:04.099 align:start position:0%
be supporting the motion to
 
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
if nobody else has anything I'll ask the
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the rule
 
00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
yeah Vice chairman gagne yes clerk votes
 
00:59:17.099 --> 00:59:17.870 align:start position:0%
yeah Vice chairman gagne yes clerk votes
yes

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Hill yes representative
 
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:25.140 align:start position:0%
Gorski yes representative Rambo yes
 
00:59:27.289 --> 00:59:27.299 align:start position:0%
representative Rich representative
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
tolersky yes representative Fox yes
 
00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:34.220 align:start position:0%
representative yes chairman Walsh yes
 
00:59:36.289 --> 00:59:36.299 align:start position:0%
all right so the motion to recommend
 
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
future legislation is adopted 10-0
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh I'll close the executive session on
 
00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:44.339 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 308
 
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
that is officially Our Last Action as a
 
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
committee for for this term so we
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
already gave our speeches at our last
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
meeting so I'm not going to bother doing
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
it again but thank everybody for coming
 
00:59:59.210 --> 00:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
and we are out of here there's plenty of
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
time for lunch thank you so I don't know
 
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
who still owes me reports
 
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
but we do have to report these
 
01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.530 align:start position:0%
but we do have to report these
things

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:11.579 align:start position:0%
I'll get an answer to that too Cameron
 
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
where do those reports go so I don't
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
know but I will find out I mean they're
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to get turned into the clerk but
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
when did they do anything with them they
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't show up on the docket right
 
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
all I did at this point was confirm the
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
fact that we do need a written report on
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
them with our recommendation uh I'll
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
follow up with the clerk they might just
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
go in the file with the bill I mean it
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
may not be relative enough to make it on
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
print in the calendar
 
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
so on that form they also list consent
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
calendar or not
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
to me it's never a vote so I'm not sure
 
01:00:47.569 --> 01:00:47.579 align:start position:0%
what this consent calendar is talking
 
01:00:47.579 --> 01:00:50.210 align:start position:0%
what this consent calendar is talking
about

01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
wow you're looking you're using the
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
regular committee report sheets
 
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
the actual file sheets of the two
 
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
motions can I see one of those please
 
01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:03.299 align:start position:0%
whatever which one yeah can you read the
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
majority the one the clerk gave you
 
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh the exact actual executive session
 
01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.609 align:start position:0%
uh the exact actual executive session
bill

01:01:13.609 --> 01:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
the only motions are recommended for
 
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
future legislation or not there's no
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
reference to consent for anything so the
 
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
sheets that you're giving me the report
 
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
on are generic sheets not specific to
 
01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
so right right so I will confirm with
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
the clerk where they go I suspect again
 
01:01:38.089 --> 01:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
they go into the file with this bill
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
because they all still have a file for
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
future reference
 
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
so when we did two motions
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
what's that I I didn't have enough
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
sheets so
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
um I had to do two motions on one sheet
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
no I just did it on the front
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to show you
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:22.079 --> 01:02:23.089 align:start position:0%
 
one

01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
minority motion not to recommend to not
 
01:02:25.319 --> 01:02:41.150 align:start position:0%
minority motion not to recommend to not
recommend

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:55.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.799 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
foreign
