00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know for sure but i doubt that
 

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.070 align:start position:0%
i don't know for sure but i doubt that
they<00:19:39.919><c> would</c><00:19:40.160><c> approve</c><00:19:40.720><c> any</c><00:19:41.120><c> septic</c><00:19:41.600><c> system</c>

they would approve any septic system
 

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.909 align:start position:0%
they would approve any septic system
that<00:19:42.320><c> was</c><00:19:42.559><c> smaller</c><00:19:43.039><c> than</c>

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
a thousand gallons this was the grease
 

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.310 align:start position:0%
a thousand gallons this was the grease

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
to be a thousand gallons yeah that's the
 

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.430 align:start position:0%
to be a thousand gallons yeah that's the
