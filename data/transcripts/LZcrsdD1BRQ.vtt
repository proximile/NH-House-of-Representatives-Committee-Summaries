00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
several people have said they aren't
 
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
able to attend
 
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
so we will stick them with the difficult
 
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.350 align:start position:0%
so we will stick them with the difficult
bills

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah my plan is to just skim through
 
00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
decides which ones somebody wants
 
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
wants to work on
 
00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
and make sure there is somebody assigned
 
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
each and every one of them to write a
 
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
report on what needs to be done in the
 
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.350 align:start position:0%
report on what needs to be done in the
future

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.030 align:start position:0%
future
so

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
we'll start at the top with the midwives
 
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh i sent out a notice that the midwives
 
00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 align:start position:0%
board is meeting to write their rules
 
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
including their scope of practice
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
and so i would think that anybody who's
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
interested in this
 
00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 align:start position:0%

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.270 align:start position:0%
should be working with the
um

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
working with the midwives and planning
 
00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
on figuring out how they're working out
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
on their rules
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
lot like a subcommittee chairman it
 
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
sounds a lot like a subcommittee
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
chairman yes but
 
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%

but
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
this this concerns me because
 
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.469 align:start position:0%
this this concerns me because
overall

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
i wish
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
that we had some kind of dominion this
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
exception look i put in a garbage
 
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
disposal is that
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
is that plumbing
 
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
change of faucet is that plumbing
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to take me to jail for it
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
but it's not legal is it
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
but if it's your house it is
 
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.749 align:start position:0%
but if it's your house it is
well

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:22.550 align:start position:0%
well
oh

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
but you should be able to hire a
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
handyman to do that sort of little uh
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
on the other hand if the guys or the
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
here i go if this is on the grounds of
 
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
safety it shouldn't matter if it's your
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
house you got a family in there unless
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
you're a hermit
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay so i think that that you should be
 
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.590 align:start position:0%
okay so i think that that you should be
i'll

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
since you've heard
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
the trouble is that i want to
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
redo the whole darn thing and i don't
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
know how i can do that why not
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
i mean seriously one of the things that
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
that bill included was a rewrite of the
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the exemption for
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%

13.95 i'm taking because
 
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.350 align:start position:0%
13.95 i'm taking because
uh

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
i want to use some of the ideas we
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
developed on 358
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
and see if we can come up with something
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
all right 14 29
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
licensure from massage establishments
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
all right well 1429 definitely
 
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.270 align:start position:0%
all right well 1429 definitely
because

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee sort of stalemate i
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
think what what we
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
decided in subcommittee was that we
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
needed to look at
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
local regulation rather than statewide
 
00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:42.230 align:start position:0%
local regulation rather than statewide
okay

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
all right so how about 1444
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
a jackie also okay because that one the
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
it looked
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
to this as i remember the subcommittee
 
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.110 align:start position:0%
to this as i remember the subcommittee
said

00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
it ought to be covered by hhs under
 
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
other medical facilities not just
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
not not particularly old plc
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
right sorry well
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
you know i think the issue was when the
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
local place had the authority i think
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
steve was he that was his subcommittee i
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
believe that dealt with it so okay yeah
 
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.750 align:start position:0%

salem thought they did and derry thought
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%

okay

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
i was going to volunteer on that one too
 
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.230 align:start position:0%
i was going to volunteer on that one too
so

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
well the governor the governor signed
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
the other bill so we're we're golden
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
1557 is goalie he'll just uh
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
this is going really quickly
 
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.269 align:start position:0%
this is going really quickly
so

00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh jackie you've got two of the big ones
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
so you're gonna have to
 
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.790 align:start position:0%
so you're gonna have to
uh

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you'll have a lot of help on
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
those because they're important
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
i'm counting on it
 
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.949 align:start position:0%
i'm counting on it
okay

00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
which one was 15 57 goalie
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we had another bill that did most
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
of it so
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
1566 the prescription drug affordability
 
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.990 align:start position:0%
1566 the prescription drug affordability
board

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair i don't think we need to
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
work on that because uh the substance of
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
the bill was passed in senate bill 450.
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
but if you need someone to write a
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
report i'll be glad to do so all right i
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
think you would be perfect
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
because yes that other bill did pass and
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how much overlap there is
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
all of 15 16 six ended up included in
 
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.150 align:start position:0%
all of 15 16 six ended up included in
450.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
450.
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay then that'll be an easy one
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like you just wrote it yeah
 
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.949 align:start position:0%
sounds like you just wrote it yeah
yes

00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:25.990 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
by the way i i plan to schedule an exact
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
session on these bills
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
the week of the veto session whenever
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
since we have at least one bill vetoed
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
already we'll uh
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
yeah do you know is the speaker planning
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
to do um what would you call it a summer
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
ban on work
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes if the this week's calendar already
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
says there's no travel
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
in june
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
in july and august okay so
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
june is open
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
so if you if you've got people that want
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
to work on something
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
i think you what what you could do is
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
meet figure out if you need research or
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
start doing some research and then get
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
back together
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
probably late august
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
and incidentally
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
brad would you stand up and introduce
 
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:33.030 align:start position:0%
brad would you stand up and introduce
yourself

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
greenland greenland yes um
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
after the committees of conference our
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
previous researcher has gone over to
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
this the safety of ols and he's now a
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill drafter
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes if i just may let the
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee know i've had the
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
pleasure of working with brad over in
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
criminal justice
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.829 align:start position:0%
all right
body

00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:07.330 align:start position:0%
art yikes thank you and
 
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.069 align:start position:0%
art yikes thank you and
[Laughter]

00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
that one is also a question of local
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
control and whether you need
 
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.990 align:start position:0%
control and whether you need
um

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
what you need in terms of of the of
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
facility or establishment licensing
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
not and it's
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with with the
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
she's wincing so i think not she's
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
already got two of the tough ones that
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to be working on
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
but seriously if the visage
 
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.829 align:start position:0%
but seriously if the visage
establishments

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
isn't that basically the same animal
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
sort of yeah you know what
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
um i'll i'll do it okay okay because it
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
follows suit and i think it won't be as
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
heavy lift so
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to burn you but it just seems
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
unnatural no you're right i mean the
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
whole there
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
all three of them have a question of
 
00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:12.389 align:start position:0%
all three of them have a question of
what

00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
what we need at the state level and what
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
we need at the local level because i
 
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.430 align:start position:0%
we need at the local level because i
think

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
all the people that come in pushing for
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
this registration are in the
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
are in cd1 and they're not ignoring the
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
less dense part of the state
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
where we don't have the same kind of
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
issues with the
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
with these establishments all right
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you jackie you're going for
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
taking that on
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
so that that was kind of my question so
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
what's the formal process they'll be
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
scheduled and noticed uh work sessions
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm okay yeah
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
and i would suspect
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
that you bet i'd suggest you have at
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
least one in june
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
that you've named shadow chairman
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
are we going to use our wrists for the
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
committees that we've used whoever is
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
interested can show up
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
so at the if if you the chair schedules
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
the first meeting
 
00:15:10.959 --> 00:15:13.670 align:start position:0%
the first meeting
then

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.670 align:start position:0%
it could be
just

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's conceivable it's the chairman in
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
all the trades out there
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's conceivable themselves it could be
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
well let's we're also going to be
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
assigned to a number of study committees
 
00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:45.829 align:start position:0%
assigned to a number of study committees
there's

00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
one in senate bill 330 that's
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
got a look at the opera all the
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
operations of oplc
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
its funding
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
so we will be needing at least two
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
people to serve on that committee and
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
diane i think you're likely to be one of
 
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.749 align:start position:0%
diane i think you're likely to be one of
them

00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
and there may be others
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's the only one that i know that we
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
that passed so
 
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:31.030 align:start position:0%
that passed so
okay

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
i don't see where'd you uh are you
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
looking for comments when it's 3 30 or
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
even moving on
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
2 30 3 30.
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
i think you just talked about you
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
stopped i stopped and said that's
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
the senate agreed with us
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
i haven't i didn't notice that the
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
governor signed it or not but i can't
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
see him not
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
and that has a significant study
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
committee that we will
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
that we have to support
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
um i'm the
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
other thing is the
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
water pollution and waste disposal which
 
00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:17.750 align:start position:0%
water pollution and waste disposal which
was

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
1000 gallon tank
 
00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:21.990 align:start position:0%
1000 gallon tank
and

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
what i think needs to be looked at on
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
that one is whether or not you
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
who sets the rules between the building
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
code and the sewer requirements
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know what's inside and what's
 
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.110 align:start position:0%
you know what's inside and what's
outside

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
outside
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not comfortable with letting des
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
have complete control because i think
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
the plumbers need to get involved
 
00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:46.890 align:start position:0%
the plumbers need to get involved
and

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:46.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.150 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
yeah well this this case is you know
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
they find they they
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
they settled and put in a
 
00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:57.590 align:start position:0%
they settled and put in a
gigantic

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
gigantic
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
grease trap but the
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
the whole idea that the
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
des rule says thousand gallons minimum
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
and when you ask rule them about it they
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
say oh well there's we can make
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
exceptions but the rules don't say so
 
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.470 align:start position:0%
exceptions but the rules don't say so
so

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
we could probably go to 1500 if you
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to or two 750s if you're looking
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
for somebody to take that on i'll i'll
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
do it okay well thank you i think that
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
i was a little 13 12. set back when
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
um they had turned around to the
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
individuals and said well we're willing
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
to work with you after they already put
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
it in yeah that was just
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
yes i'm called for it with that comment
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess that the challenge will be
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
if you're gonna
 
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.789 align:start position:0%
if you're gonna
actually

00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
let them make exceptions how do you
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
write a rule that's going to fit it'll
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
be sort of objective but also
 
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.310 align:start position:0%
be sort of objective but also
yes

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
have enough flexibility yeah okay so
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
like once it got this far oh okay we're
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
sorry we'll work with you
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
after somebody had this redemption to
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
keep on pursuing it a lot of people
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
might not have and they just and i'll
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
talk to judy
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
that's yeah the intimidation factor i
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
think is what's not
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay and also i mean they could easily
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
have said you know a thousand gallons
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
unless a an alternate is approved by the
 
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.950 align:start position:0%
unless a an alternate is approved by the
department

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i don't think it was
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
i don't think the thousand gallon part
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
was an issue because i don't i'm don't
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know for sure but i doubt that
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
they would approve any septic system
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
that was smaller than
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
a thousand gallons this was the grease
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
trap not the leach field or the septic
 
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.270 align:start position:0%
trap not the leach field or the septic
tank

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
tank
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
just a grease strap the green trap had
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
to be a thousand gallons yeah that's the
 
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.430 align:start position:0%
to be a thousand gallons yeah that's the
minimum

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay so i have another question though
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
unrelated to that is there an easy way
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
to find all the study committees
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
so because i know sometimes if you you
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
know you might want to volunteer for one
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
are you talking about chapter studies
 
00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:13.350 align:start position:0%
are you talking about chapter studies
no

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
there's a page on the house website that
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
statutory and study committees but it's
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
not always as as up to date as as it
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
ought to be
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
i would talk to
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
deborah childs in the speaker's office
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
because she's his
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
worker bee on getting people to be on
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
those committees so she's got a folder
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:37.750 align:start position:0%
like this
so

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
she should be able to tell you what the
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
where they're looking for bodies sounds
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they still do but the
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
clerk's office
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
used to also chase
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
studies that demand like a nominee for
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
an entity
 
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.710 align:start position:0%
an entity
so

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they do that but that
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
would be something if
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know like uh something
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
particularly in your case like education
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
the other thing you could do on the um
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
for new ones
 
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.350 align:start position:0%
for new ones
is

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
is do a search on you know
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.070 align:start position:0%
something that
study

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.350 align:start position:0%
study
do

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's probably in the committee yeah
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
because sometimes they're packaged in
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
with other things too yeah but usually
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
they put a study committee in the uh in
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
the title
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
yeah it that would certainly give you a
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
start for sure
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
because somehow that seems
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
unsatisfactory you think that this
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
clerk's office would have such a list
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
because they have so many other
 
00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:49.750 align:start position:0%
because they have so many other
resources

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
here's committees
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
standing committees
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
statutory and study committees yes
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
yes but that at the moment we were busy
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
passing bills and they aren't
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be on that website
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
yet all right you know by by november
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.950 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.669 align:start position:0%
right
so

00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
but if you do see if you do see one that
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
looks interesting
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so two years ago i volunteered for
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
the mushroom harvesting license yeah so
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
that that was fun
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
so i mean to volunteer anything that
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
enticing let the speaker know usually
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah my first term i volunteered
 
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.430 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah my first term i volunteered
for

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
a study committee on sprinklers and um
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
that's how i got involved in building
 
00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:45.669 align:start position:0%
that's how i got involved in building
codes

00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
codes
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
i got put on an i.t related one which uh
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
has never met and doesn't meet i guess
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's just another issue
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess the chair has to call a
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
the clerk's
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
gratitude for having
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
only two or
 
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
only three committees of conference and
 
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
they're all and the ones that
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
met agreement are both on consent so we
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
should not have any debates on thursday
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
and i will say our committee did very
 
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.510 align:start position:0%
and i will say our committee did very
well

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
well i don't know we had we had two that
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
reached uh friendly agreement very
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
quickly and uh one that totally stamina
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
did but
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's why we're studying uh yeah yeah
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
that's why which one that's why we're
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
working on it
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
which one got stuck i forgot
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
expansion of japan members oh yeah the
 
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.710 align:start position:0%
expansion of japan members oh yeah the
uh

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
the senate dug there
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.470 align:start position:0%
the uh
it

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
even after we agreed to eczema awareness
 
00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:02.630 align:start position:0%
even after we agreed to eczema awareness
month

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
i mean the biggest issue i think
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
with ours and i've heard from others is
 
00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:07.510 align:start position:0%
with ours and i've heard from others is
that

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
everybody shows up to the house hearings
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
and expresses their views and we try and
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
take them into account and then nobody
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
bothers to show up in front of the
 
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.190 align:start position:0%
bothers to show up in front of the
senate

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
and so for the child care licensing one
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
i think the only people that showed up
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
there were from the department
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
and so they didn't hear about any
 
00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:22.210 align:start position:0%
and so they didn't hear about any
problems

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:22.220 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.310 align:start position:0%
problems
[Music]

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
yeah not sure why the house hearings are
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
so much easier to get to
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
anybody have anything else that needs to
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm just
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
to come and i
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%

so

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
we're figuring out what we can do about
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
we can talk
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
so we've got two that just need a report
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
and the rest we're actually going to be
 
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
working on somehow so
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
well we're not drafting legislation
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
draft a report well you could draft
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
legislation if you like we don't have to
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
my output will be criteria for what the
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
legislation should look like that's
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
equally important
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
