00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm turning on
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
the microphone i guess we are live
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
streaming this is the
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
work session for house bill
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
1368 in legislative administration
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
we have a limited
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
audience and a limited committee
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
but we certainly can
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
can have
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
where the
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
where the responsibility lies with the
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislative committee
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh house bill 1368
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
from from the lowest possible bar
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
the legislation is worthy of of
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
in the next term or whether we believe
 
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.269 align:start position:0%
in the next term or whether we believe
it's

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's reached its
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
usefulness and will and will terminate
 
00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:10.150 align:start position:0%
usefulness and will and will terminate
here

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that future legislation
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
won't however be or the same legislation
 
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.470 align:start position:0%
won't however be or the same legislation
be

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
resubmitted in september
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
what i would like to do this is not a
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
hearing i want to make that clear
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
this is a work session so
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
and it's meant for
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
the committee members to
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
discuss amongst ourselves and and
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
pull it apart and decide ultimately
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
whether the legislation should go
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
forward or
 
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.509 align:start position:0%
forward or
or

00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
be recommended to to terminate
 
00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:50.069 align:start position:0%
be recommended to to terminate
um

00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to run this
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
very informally and
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
and let everyone
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
talk the way they want to from the
 
00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.509 align:start position:0%
talk the way they want to from the
committee

00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
if there are questions that you
 
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.030 align:start position:0%
if there are questions that you
have

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
that you would like to address
 
00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:09.750 align:start position:0%
that you would like to address
to

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
the member of the ethics committee that
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
is also in the room um
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to allow that um
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't have
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
had there been additional committee
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
members but um
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
commit additional people in the in the
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
room but
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to do this as
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
informally as possible and if anybody
 
00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:36.069 align:start position:0%
informally as possible and if anybody
um

00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
wants to go from there we certainly can
 
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.350 align:start position:0%
wants to go from there we certainly can
um

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
my goal just
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
just to set the table a little bit
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
my goal is to
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
with legislation on conflict of interest
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
and and recusal
 
00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.870 align:start position:0%
and and recusal
um

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
is always to create something so simple
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
that any any member
 
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.790 align:start position:0%
that any any member
um

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
who listens to
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
a piece of legislation
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
can in their own mind
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
without consulting their family attorney
 
00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:12.870 align:start position:0%
without consulting their family attorney
or

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else around them make the
 
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
anyone else around them make the
determination

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
fairly rapidly whether this is
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
rises to the level of a conflict of
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
interest and whether they should recuse
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
themselves from
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
from the debate and or from the vote
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
i don't want this to get to the point
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
where it rises to a complaint and
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
therefore it's something that the ethics
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
committee has to deal with
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
in the past we've seen cases i believe
 
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.190 align:start position:0%
in the past we've seen cases i believe
where

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
the ethics committee has acted on
 
00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:55.269 align:start position:0%
the ethics committee has acted on
complaints

00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:56.710 align:start position:0%
complaints
and

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
and the confusion of the legislat the
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
existing rules and regulations were such
 
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.350 align:start position:0%
existing rules and regulations were such
that

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.710 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
a shrug of the shoulders and and a slap
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
on the wrist was um put forth just
 
00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:11.269 align:start position:0%
on the wrist was um put forth just
because

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
we couldn't understand the rules or we
 
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
thought we were on the right side of the
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
rules and therefore
 
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:17.910 align:start position:0%
rules and therefore
um

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know it was not acted upon i
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
we should be able to create
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
i'm a black and white guy anyway um
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
and i would rather er on the side of
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
recusal than not
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
but that may be me so um with that i'm
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
that with that background of
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
of what i'm looking for as just a member
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
of this work session
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
um maybe everyone else would want to
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
chime in of what they're looking for
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
and and what
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
problems or
 
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.470 align:start position:0%
problems or
um

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
or pieces of the legislation they
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
particularly enjoy
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
or or want to see removed i think all of
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm pretty much going to
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
just step down as chair and be
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
a work session uh participant
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
so the questions that i have whenever i
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
take a look at bills especially ethics
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
bills is i always go back to the
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
underlying definitions of what i'm doing
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
because in order to
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
rewrite something i need to understand
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
what the terms mean or how they're
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
defined to determine whether or not they
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
are correctly put in any proposed
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
legislation like in this one
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
and when i first read the bill i had a
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
question as to how
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
household member was defined because
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
it's referenced throughout this
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
they we talk about conflict of interest
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
and they talk about financial and
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
non-financial but then almost every
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
other paragraph that's amended here one
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
a one b and five
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
talks about the legislator or
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
legislators household member
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
so i went back to the definition of a
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
household member
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
and the definition of a household member
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
was a little bit
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
confusing to me and probably needed to
 
00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:30.790 align:start position:0%
confusing to me and probably needed to
be

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
looked at a little closer
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
in today's day and age a lot of folks
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
that contribute
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
to daily expenses
 
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.629 align:start position:0%
to daily expenses
um

00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
of a household doesn't necessarily have
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
to be living in that household
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
so you can have a divorced couple
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
or a customer that is separated
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
and they're not necessarily domiciled
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
in the same household anymore
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
but yet they contribute to the daily
 
00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:02.310 align:start position:0%
but yet they contribute to the daily
living

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
living
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
so household member
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
i would remove
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
living in the same domicile
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
as the same legislator a legislative
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
employee and take that first part of the
 
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.910 align:start position:0%
employee and take that first part of the
test

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
out of it
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
and i would have and as i put before
 
00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:22.519 align:start position:0%
with a draft amendment
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
2106h to this
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
that a household member shall mean any
 
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.310 align:start position:0%
that a household member shall mean any
person

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
who shares a common economic interest in
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
the expense of
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
daily living of a legislator a
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
legislative employee including but not
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
limited to spouse child or parent
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
i think that's more in tune with what we
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
have because you're limited
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
you're limited currently that you have
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
to live in that household even though
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
you're contributing to the daily
 
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.829 align:start position:0%
you're contributing to the daily
expenses

00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
and so to me for purposes of conflict of
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
interest it needed to be expanded a bit
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
so i dropped the domicile first part of
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
the test that was the first thing
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
because to be mentioned throughout this
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
entire bill
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
i thought was
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
an important thing to go back and look
 
00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:12.549 align:start position:0%
an important thing to go back and look
at

00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
and so it includes
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
people that are not necessarily living
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
in the same household and you know and
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
it can be a problem because when you say
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
household member a lot of people may
 
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.309 align:start position:0%
household member a lot of people may
think

00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
that you have to be in the household and
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's why the domicile was there so to
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
remove it
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
i think is a big step in including
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
people to have them think about well
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
geez could i be considered a household
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
member so then the next thing is and i
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
didn't address this
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
do you want to have a household member
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
or does it need to be another word to
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
make people
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
look at it should it be family member
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
should it be
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
whatever it is i don't know but to just
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
kind of go with what was in here
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
if i changed the household member i felt
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
much better about including more people
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
to look at whether or not they had a
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
conflict or not so that's what i did
 
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
that was my one of my things and and
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not whether or not we pass
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation i mean recommend this
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
legislation to be brought forward again
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit more in scope needs
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
to be looked at just other than the
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
financial and the non-financial interest
 
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.110 align:start position:0%
financial and the non-financial interest
um

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
but i mean i wasn't a member of that
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
committee and i don't think we really
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
went into this when we heard
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
that he we had the hearing i mean at the
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
time you know i have to be honest i
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
didn't go back to look at the
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
definitions of everything until i read
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
it again
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
we knew it probably was going to be
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
retained to look at it interim study and
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
that's when i really kind of went into
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
this thing
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have to say
 
00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:55.590 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have to say
well

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
while you're on the household member
 
00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.029 align:start position:0%
while you're on the household member
definition

00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:00.870 align:start position:0%
definition
um

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
did you do any consideration or any
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
thought about the the common economic
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
interest piece that phrase
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
in there because i'm not sure
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
that average legislator
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
um sitting in his
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
seat in reptile would say common
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
economic interest
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
what the heck is that
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
which number is that in greg that uh
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's right in definition 14b
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
one definition oh you're talking about
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
going looking at the definitions of the
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
whole the statute
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
the current statute okay not the bill
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
itself okay that's where that same
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
domicile comes from that same line
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
it says a common economic interest
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
i can see
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
people saying
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
i need it i need a
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
definition of that
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
because down below
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
it talks about a financial interest
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
exists but it doesn't talk any and a
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
non-financial personal interest exists
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
well i think the way i read that was
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
when they share an economic interest in
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
the sentence in the expenses of daily
 
00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.390 align:start position:0%
the sentence in the expenses of daily
living

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
living
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's how i had defined economic
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
interest at the expenses of daily living
 
00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:15.350 align:start position:0%
interest at the expenses of daily living
so

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't look to change that because i i
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
kind of equated it to be the expenses of
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
daily living so is economic the same as
 
00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:26.070 align:start position:0%
daily living so is economic the same as
financial

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
financial
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
a good question i don't know but in
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
terms of the consistency here so it
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that that household
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
member definition
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
change economic interest to financial
 
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.190 align:start position:0%
change economic interest to financial
interest

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
well but we also talk about
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
non-financial interest
 
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.750 align:start position:0%
non-financial interest
so

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
so do we not use that household member
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
definition when it when it comes to a
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
non-household non-economic personal
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
interest i think it could
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
i know but this is the part that you can
 
00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.430 align:start position:0%
i know but this is the part that you can
see

00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
where someone has to make that decision
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
um if there's not common language used
 
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.669 align:start position:0%
um if there's not common language used
in

00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
throughout the definitions
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
so then are you thinking
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
i did not think it was and you know you
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
can get in this rabbit hole and not get
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
out of the rabbit hole and i and we're
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
probably pretty deep into the rabbit
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
hole right about now so i'm thinking
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
household interest shall mean any person
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
who shares
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
an interest
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
you've got me or maybe jesus shares the
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
expenses of daily living or taking the
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
whole thing i mean i don't know or even
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
just uses the same language
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
it would say the household
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
house of representative senator who
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
shares a financial interest or a
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
non-financial personal interest correct
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
so uses the same language rather than
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
creating this economic interest yep i
 
00:21:54.159 --> 00:21:55.510 align:start position:0%
creating this economic interest yep i
agree

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.590 align:start position:0%
agree
yep

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
another amendment to the amendment
 
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.029 align:start position:0%
another amendment to the amendment
yes

00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
maybe this is a good time to ask
 
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.990 align:start position:0%
maybe this is a good time to ask
whether

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
um mr lambert could
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
chime in whether that is a was
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
considered and not considered if you
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
want to jump up to the
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
we won't call it the witness table we'll
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
just call it the
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
come closer to the
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:34.870 align:start position:0%
to the
work

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
this ever conversation issue of conflict
 
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
of interest has been the most
 
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.549 align:start position:0%
of interest has been the most
complicated

00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
um part of this from the beginning it's
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
gone through several changes
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
both in terms of definitions and all and
 
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.950 align:start position:0%
both in terms of definitions and all and
scope

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
scope
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
and also the various forms
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
so yes that's been talked about for a
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
the requirement was spouse period
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
so this was expanded
 
00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:02.789 align:start position:0%
so this was expanded
already

00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:03.830 align:start position:0%
already
um

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.070 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
financial interest also uses the
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
entities here the guidelines and two
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
statutes which all have pretty much
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
overlapping definitions in some case
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
so not just overlapping sometimes
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
they're completely different words maybe
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
describing the same thing
 
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.470 align:start position:0%
describing the same thing
but

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
so on page 26 of the booklet in 14b
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
special interest is defined and then
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's broken down to what you were just
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
saying mr chairman the financial
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
interest and a non-financial personal
 
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.310 align:start position:0%
interest and a non-financial personal
interest

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.269 align:start position:0%
interest
26.

00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's the same 14b one definitions that
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
and it seems that using that special
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
interest definition
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
the phrase distinct from and greater
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
than the interests of the public at
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
large were
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to jump into that
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
subject until we get off of this one of
 
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.830 align:start position:0%
subject until we get off of this one of
whether

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
a common economic interest is the same
 
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.830 align:start position:0%
a common economic interest is the same
as

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
a financial interest
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case why
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
not use the financial interest language
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
and and does the household member not
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
also have a non-financial personal
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
interest they do
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
but but it's not mentioned in the
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
well that's true
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
and that's this is where the confusion
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
lies for that person that's trying to
 
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's not an attorney that's trying to
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
figure out for themselves do i have a a
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest with this piece of
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
legislation when you start
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
getting the definitions and this is the
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
key the definitions well devil is in the
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
details right um
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
the definitions that's would be the
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
first place that i would go as a
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
legislator to determine whether i have a
 
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.230 align:start position:0%
legislator to determine whether i have a
conflict

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
i would read that household member and
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
say a common economic interest oh great
 
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.149 align:start position:0%
say a common economic interest oh great
it's

00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's a non-economic interest that i'm
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
that i'm worried about so therefore i'm
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
fine well until you read down below
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
and it says
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
non-financial exists and and now i'm
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
now i'm confused and i don't know
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
you would not have to um
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
recuse yourself
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
you would the question is disclosure
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
the other area where
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
you can't get to that point unless you
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
have the definitions defined precisely
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
right and so what greg is absolutely
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
correct common economic interests should
 
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.590 align:start position:0%
correct common economic interests should
be

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
financial or non-financial interest
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
there's no question that's one thing
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
that has to happen but we really can't
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
we really can't just say
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
that they live in the same domicile
 
00:26:56.799 --> 00:26:57.750 align:start position:0%
that they live in the same domicile
that

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
can't be if you're going to women
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
with non-financial interests you see i
 
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.669 align:start position:0%
with non-financial interests you see i
do

00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i feel like we're but i feel like
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
we're nitpicking and i'm and i'm not
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
trying to be that i'm trying to get to
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
the point where we're using the same
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
language in every area
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
for that simple
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of letting the legislator decide
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
for themselves not having to go to you
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
and ask if there's a
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
if they have a problem that's that's my
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
bottom line is how do they how do they
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
decide for themselves
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
well i know that when members come to me
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
about their financial disclosure forms
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
like a lot of them would
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
they were confused about it but they're
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
happy that there's some sort of line
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
drawn where in the domicile
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
is stated because they'll say things
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
such as well i don't know what my kids
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
interests are
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
or you know i have no control over what
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
they do and what i have to file an
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
amended form every time they do
 
00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:06.149 align:start position:0%
amended form every time they do
something

00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
that changes their economic interests so
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of
 
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.269 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of
issue

00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
in a practical sense yeah
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
i can see i can see that but also in the
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
case that um that representative ruler
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
what if what if you are
 
00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.310 align:start position:0%
what if what if you are
still

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
still controlling the economic interests
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
of your family
 
00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:29.110 align:start position:0%
of your family
um

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
but from another location you are a
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
divorce parent or something like that
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know certainly
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
be an issue if yes
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
even within just that one little
 
00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:46.870 align:start position:0%
even within just that one little
phrase

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
we've got two
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
diametrically opposed situations
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
one you would one you wouldn't
 
00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:55.830 align:start position:0%
one you would one you wouldn't
so

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't help when you're using
 
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.669 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't help when you're using
different

00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
phraseology to describe the same
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
different units of measurement yeah
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
different using units of measure i like
 
00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:07.590 align:start position:0%
different using units of measure i like
that

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.710 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
so at any rate i
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know how we resolve
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know i think
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
i think also the other thing as i'm
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
sitting here really reading this again
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
for probably the 100th time
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
they changed financial and non-financial
 
00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:41.669 align:start position:0%
they changed financial and non-financial
um

00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the last sentence here
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
substantially greater than the benefit
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
or detriment would be through a business
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
client so why is that in special
 
00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:51.669 align:start position:0%
client so why is that in special
interest

00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:55.590 align:start position:0%
interest
versus

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
so why would we have special
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
financial interest in a non-financial
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
interest to be a different burden or a
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
different test
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
then we have a special interest
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
so you're pulling back the old language
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
from financial and non-financial and
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
seeking it back in special interest
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
and which by the way
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
and it also has household members doing
 
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.310 align:start position:0%
and it also has household members doing
it

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
it needs to be redefined
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
for many years conflict of interest was
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
defined as financial interest period
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
and it is in many states still it's they
 
00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:38.230 align:start position:0%
and it is in many states still it's they
ignore

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
ignore
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
the non-financial it was the
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh study commission that changed that in
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
2000 2014 and it was passed in 15 by
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay legislature
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
for a specific instance or or was it
 
00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.509 align:start position:0%
for a specific instance or or was it
just

00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
looking at other
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
they were looking at everything states
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
and the thought was that
 
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
right along the thought has been that
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
most legislators want to conform with
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
these provisions but a lot of cases they
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
don't understand them because they're
 
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.110 align:start position:0%
don't understand them because they're
complicated

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:15.909 align:start position:0%
complicated
so

00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
the commission looked long and hard at
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and there was a
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
discussion about requiring recusal
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
um that was not only about two members
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
agreed with that others were very
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
strongly opposed to requiring recusal
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
instead they then focused on uh
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
strengthening the conflict of interest
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
to add more to it such as the non-uh
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
financial personal interest
 
00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.430 align:start position:0%
financial personal interest
um

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.710 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
that's when
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
financial interest into this new term
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
special interest that was a creation of
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
the study a recommendation of the study
 
00:31:57.519 --> 00:31:59.350 align:start position:0%
the study a recommendation of the study
commission

00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.470 align:start position:0%
commission
um

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
so that now this bill would reverse that
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
in a sense because you're taking
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
out financial interest and non-financial
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
personal interest from the definition of
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
special interest and putting it under
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
where it used to be
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
because i think that
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative gordon
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to have a term
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
that would define when you needed to
 
00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:25.350 align:start position:0%
that would define when you needed to
recuse

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
recuse
 
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.669 align:start position:0%
recuse
ah

00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
but nowhere did we see in here just
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
um disclosure is
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
there there's no table for saying and in
 
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.190 align:start position:0%
there there's no table for saying and in
these

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances you disclose and in these
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances you
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
you recuse and those are the two options
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
right i mean that
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
there's not a third that i that isn't
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
also mentioned no okay so they bulked up
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
the disclosure by adding non-financial
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
but also requiring verbal disclosure
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
and that applies to the
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
broader definition of
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
when you have a
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
for example the retirement system if a
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
legislator or household member is in the
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
retirement system and you disclose that
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
on your financial disclosure form
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
and a bill comes along that affects all
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
members of the of the retirement system
 
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.830 align:start position:0%
members of the of the retirement system
equally

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
equally
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
you don't have to file another form you
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
don't have to file the declaration of
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
intent form but you do
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
make a verbal disclosure at certain
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
points when you're engaging in in
 
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.669 align:start position:0%
points when you're engaging in in
advocacy

00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
advocacy
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
that that was the idea that then because
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
the thought was well these forms just
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
get you know filed away somewhere no one
 
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.870 align:start position:0%
get you know filed away somewhere no one
knows

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
knows
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
or another example if you're a landlord
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
and you're testifying on a bill that
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
helps the landlord side of the landlord
 
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.389 align:start position:0%
helps the landlord side of the landlord
tenant

00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:54.310 align:start position:0%
tenant
issue

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
maybe you file some form somewhere but
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's not really readily known when
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
you're testifying so in the from
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
the result of this change you need to
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
say yes
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
i'm a landlord and then you can make
 
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.590 align:start position:0%
i'm a landlord and then you can make
your

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.750 align:start position:0%
your
argument

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
argument
 
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.470 align:start position:0%
argument
go

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.790 align:start position:0%
go
so

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
the way the bill reads now
 
00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:24.470 align:start position:0%
the way the bill reads now
um

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
a financial interest exists for a
 
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.909 align:start position:0%
a financial interest exists for a
legislator

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
could stand to gain or lose anything of
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
material values as a result of the
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
official capacity would that require
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
that legislator
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
who has a financial interest as a member
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
of a union or the state employee against
 
00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:44.069 align:start position:0%
of a union or the state employee against
pension

00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
pension
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
what would they be required to do would
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
they be have to recuse or would they
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
have to just disclose disclose
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
and how does it where does how would the
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
person that's reading that definition
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
know that they would be disclosing once
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
you're entering so if they have it
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
exactly and if they so if they have
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
something that they are
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
going to gain
 
00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:10.390 align:start position:0%
going to gain
financially

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
financially
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
but ideally that's a policy decision
 
00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.349 align:start position:0%
but ideally that's a policy decision
that

00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:24.870 align:start position:0%

for
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
i don't i didn't redisclose anywhere in
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
any of these did you ever see anywhere
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
that that that disclosure was a
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%

and

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
i still come back true to your question
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
because recusal was discussed
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
i mean there were
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
gary richardson has been an attorney for
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
many years and
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
any attorney knows that you know you
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
don't disclose anything you recuse from
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
a case if you have some sort of conflict
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
of interest
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
but that's always been
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
i mean you could go back to the
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
beginning when
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
former senator and congressman charlie
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
bass established this
 
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.030 align:start position:0%
bass established this
committee

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
they talked about recusal then a little
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
bit but they were felt fortunate to get
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
past what got passed it took many years
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
to have an ethics committee
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
because the thought was that this is a
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
citizens legislature
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
where people have
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
not paid they have jobs and interests of
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
their own and many times constituents
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
the argument is constituents are voting
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
for people because of their expertise in
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
a certain area perhaps right you know in
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
agricultural areas of the state it's
 
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
important to have
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
people represent the interests of
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
farmers and
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
logging interests or whatever and
 
00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.550 align:start position:0%
logging interests or whatever and
so

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's why it was based on disclosure
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
most of the time
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
and when i say most of the time because
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's other
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
part of the guidelines the prohibited
 
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.349 align:start position:0%
part of the guidelines the prohibited
activities

00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
and that that
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
is something you can look at too which
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
is what
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
the two
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
aspects of this came
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
together bumped together in the
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
complaint two of our complaints that you
 
00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:40.630 align:start position:0%
complaint two of our complaints that you
have

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
one against former senator bragdon and
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
one against representative late
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative lay
 
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.950 align:start position:0%
representative lay
because

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
we have always been careful in any sort
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
of orientation or continuing education
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
most of our
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines require
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
disclosure but that's not always
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
a solution the remedy to
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
you having a financial interest there
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
are some
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances which are laid out in the
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
prohibited activity section where you
 
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.510 align:start position:0%
prohibited activity section where you
can't

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
participate in disclosure would not
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
solve that
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
what exactly what can you give me an
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
example of that
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
and that's i think representative hill
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
was referring to that the committee
 
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.790 align:start position:0%
was referring to that the committee
would

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
didn't go forward with any sort of
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
serious sanctions in those cases because
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
argued that he made disclosures that he
 
00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.310 align:start position:0%
argued that he made disclosures that he
was

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
president of the union if that's what he
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
was president
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
and um he thought that's all he had to
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
do but
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
um if you look into the prohibited
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
activity section which is i keep
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
having to refer you to these things but
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
in four
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.310 align:start position:0%
and um
yes

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.510 align:start position:0%
yes
uh

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
page four
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
in fact that first paragraph
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
i was added by the study commission to
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
clarify that there are some
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances where disclosure does not
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
you can read it yourself excuse or
 
00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.030 align:start position:0%
you can read it yourself excuse or
absolve

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
absolve
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
from compliance with the prohibited
 
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.069 align:start position:0%
from compliance with the prohibited
activities

00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
so legislators shall not solicit accept
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
or agree to accept anything of value
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
from other persons
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
knowing or believing they may be
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
wanting to influence
 
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
you or the legislation
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
or d
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
um if you were
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
um employed by someone who was
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
interested in legislation you can't
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
if you were receiving something of value
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's getting more complicated right now
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so it not only becomes complicated
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
it it's circular
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
there is no end point at any of this
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
lines that i have with if you have a
 
00:41:05.359 --> 00:41:07.670 align:start position:0%
lines that i have with if you have a
and bright

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
financial interest
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
either you or somebody in your household
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
would like to have it no longer living
 
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.349 align:start position:0%
would like to have it no longer living
there

00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
um has a financial interest
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
they can disclose that when they fill
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
out the form before this one interact
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
this one and i forget when it is
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
that we should have those folks voting
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
on legislation that would directly
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
benefit their purse and that's the
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
problem and now
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
two farmers coming to testify
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
that we need this pesticide or we don't
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
need this pesticide and this would help
 
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.270 align:start position:0%
need this pesticide and this would help
them

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit different
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
than them coming to testify on
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
legislation to prohibit a pesticide or
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
not to prepare the pesticide
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's not a direct financial interest
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
even though they're a farmer
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
and there's legislation coming forward
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that's in the
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
prohibited activities or not
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
if they are introducing something
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
without defaulting
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
i would want to as a legislative member
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
of a committee that's listening to that
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
i would want to know what they know
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:16.470 align:start position:0%
about this
so

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
i mean i certainly don't want to be
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
critical but i guess i am
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't know
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
with any of this i don't like being at
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
the circle well there's no bright line
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
that's been the problem
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
the commission's tried to do that but it
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
didn't what we're talking about is
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
strengthening the guidelines
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
considerably and i just think it's not
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
my job to talk about the politics of it
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
but i don't think there's ever been
 
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.990 align:start position:0%
but i don't think there's ever been
support

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
people thought there was support
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
does this does this um brighten the line
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
that the legislation
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
in what areas in what specifically
 
00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:56.790 align:start position:0%
in what areas in what specifically
what

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.670 align:start position:0%
what
i

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
i would think in
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
eliminating that uh
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
distinction from greater than the
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
interests of the public at large that
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
may be one example of
 
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.670 align:start position:0%
may be one example of
of

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
but it's not taken out of special
 
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.150 align:start position:0%
but it's not taken out of special
interest

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
circular argument again my circle no uh
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
it it's it's crossed out under special
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
interests is that what you said yeah
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
but but it is in
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's in special it's in the bottom
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
substantially greater than the benefit
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
of different but we're true
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
isn't that what we're talking about
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
this is different substantially it is a
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
little bit different but that's very
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
this is very confusing you think it's
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
not about
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
you you know you
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
were these
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
um developed
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
in-house specifically
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
or or was there
 
00:44:30.079 --> 00:44:31.349 align:start position:0%
or or was there
um

00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
a review of what other states are doing
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
are we did we try to recreate the wheel
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
or did we use
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
what works other places or not for this
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill or over the years um
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
well both how's that um it
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
i guess i was thinking when i asked the
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
question in the in the 2014 study
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
committee which did did we go out and
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
look at they did i was not the staff
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
person i was there but um pam smarling
 
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
whom you remember you did a great job
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
doing that getting all other states
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's what you were talking about jen
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
that your report came from no yes the
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay and i updated that for the ethics
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
committee for and for chairman gordon's
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
bill to see if anything had changed from
 
00:45:24.319 --> 00:45:29.270 align:start position:0%
bill to see if anything had changed from
ncsl

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
almost

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
almost
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
i i think i can almost go to the
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
to the point of saying we're making it
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
worse by adding additional
 
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
or changing adding additional con
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
definitions by using new language
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
instead of using the old language it and
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem that
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:46:03.839 --> 00:46:05.030 align:start position:0%
we are
giving

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
giving
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
you know expanding this ethics booklet
 
00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:09.910 align:start position:0%
you know expanding this ethics booklet
doesn't

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it clearer for the average
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
legislator as far as i can see um
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
we had a situation the other day i was
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
talking with a an existing legislator
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
who said he
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
was a was a substitute in ways and means
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
and when he got there he found that the
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill one of the bills that they were
 
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.790 align:start position:0%
bill one of the bills that they were
executing

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
executing
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
he had a conflict with
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
but he said
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
not having my ethics book with me
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
and he wouldn't have had time had he had
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
it to go through and know whether
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
he should have disclosed and or refused
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is where maybe a rules change needs
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
to be made so that he could say i'm
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
sorry i have to recuse
 
00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.069 align:start position:0%
sorry i have to recuse
but

00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
he was inside that 24-hour period and he
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to remove himself from
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
that executive session
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
and have a new person come in that
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
didn't have a an issue with it so
 
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.630 align:start position:0%
didn't have a an issue with it so
there's

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
this has tentacles i guess is my point
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
um we need
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
from from one
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
set of facts we need to keep changing
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
something else down the road as it gets
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
influenced there's many moving parts
 
00:47:28.559 --> 00:47:29.510 align:start position:0%
influenced there's many moving parts
yeah

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah well we tried to help a little i
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
hope we did with interpreter ruling
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
2016-5 which is in on page 64 of the
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
booklet and was at the time published in
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
the calendar
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
calendars and also is on the website
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
um because
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
including in that at the end there are
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
would it ever be possible
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
mr lambert to have something as simple
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
as a decision tree or
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know it
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
you know is are we talking about your
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
spouse all right yes okay are we talking
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
about a job that your spouse has that
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
create that does this yes so that
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
the simpleton legislator can just go
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
down through and say okay here i have to
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
disclose that
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
was that ever discussed no
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
then you could laminate it and hand it
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
to the legislators and
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
rather than say well you know on page 65
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
there's something that's close to what
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
this guy did do that
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
well you know
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
if you look at page 68
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
several examples actually
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
and they do say
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
declaration of intent required yes
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
verbal disclosure required yes so they
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
give certain
 
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.870 align:start position:0%
give certain
examples

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
examples
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
kind of like what would write
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
yep probably should put that on sorry
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
kind of like what greg's talking about
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
that um you know there are some
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
when do you have recusal
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
well that's what chairman gordon i
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
remember saying to you
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
if you read through
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
this there's no place that says you must
 
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
you must recuse
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
and it's been up to the committee
 
00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:33.349 align:start position:0%
and it's been up to the committee
through

00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
some interpretations and some complaints
 
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.069 align:start position:0%
some interpretations and some complaints
to

00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
establish some criteria for that right
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
and once again it would go back to the
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
prohibited activity section because you
 
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.829 align:start position:0%
prohibited activity section because you
can't

00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
you can't have a lobbyist and give you
 
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.470 align:start position:0%
you can't have a lobbyist and give you
money

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
and or something to put in the
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
legislation i mean if you disclose that
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know still it's it's a crime
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
beyond the ethics materials even
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
under criminal law i would assume but
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
the committee that's what that's what
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
led to this because the committee felt
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
there should be clearer and also
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
statutory not only based on the
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
committee's interpretation as they
 
00:50:16.559 --> 00:50:17.750 align:start position:0%
committee's interpretation as they
applied

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
applied
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
the statute and guidelines to a case
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
as they did twice
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
recusal i don't see that word anywhere
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
oh yes i do
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
14 c colon 4 a recusal for conflicts of
 
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.030 align:start position:0%
14 c colon 4 a recusal for conflicts of
interest

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
and and again then we get into okay an
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
official legislative activity special
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
i know but where's the official
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
we don't define official yeah we do i
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
think it's in the guidelines
 
00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:18.950 align:start position:0%
think it's in the guidelines
proper

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
so i like that
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
recusal portion of it
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
but i think that the conflict of
 
00:51:35.119 --> 00:51:36.870 align:start position:0%
but i think that the conflict of
interest

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.109 align:start position:0%
interest
is

00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
and we need to kind of shore up some of
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
the definitions to comply with what
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
financial and non-financial and special
 
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.430 align:start position:0%
financial and non-financial and special
interests

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
interests
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
really mean
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
they require recusal
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
i think i actually like 14c for a
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
as a piece
 
00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.069 align:start position:0%
as a piece
yes

00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's simple yeah it gives you four
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
examples yes
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
and when you need to recoup
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
nonprofit or for profit
 
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.390 align:start position:0%
nonprofit or for profit
right

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
yup i like it
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
that i like
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
but but the special the conflict of
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
interesting piece of it
 
00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:34.309 align:start position:0%
interesting piece of it
under

00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
is a little confusing and i i got that
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i think the household member and
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
they also have the word
 
00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:41.450 align:start position:0%
they also have the word
um

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:42.870 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
in the household members economic common
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
economic interest so
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
that would almost have to be changed
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
under the definition of capital not only
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
economic interest now they've got
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
the word is receiving remuneration
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
so we've got another
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
word for the same
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
thing under the first part of it under
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
receiving renewal under roman two yeah
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
roman two reasons is receiving from an
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
employer i'm in remuneration yeah which
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
has a special interest in the official
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
legislative activity
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
i don't see it i don't know
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't hear that
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
remuneration if you have it
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
if you have which is roman numeral two
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
so it would seem like we've got you
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
gotta turn on your microphone
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
so it seemed like we agreed that there's
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
some good things
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
in this bill to move forward
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
with some changes
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
or we kind of no i i
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
think so so yes
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
so yes there are pieces that we like
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
this is my
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
there are pieces in here that make sense
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes but when you
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
are adding language to 65 pages
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
are you really moving the ball forward
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
to make it and are you
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
the legislators it still comes back to
 
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.390 align:start position:0%
the legislators it still comes back to
me

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.549 align:start position:0%
me
that

00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
there's two and i'm not accusing
 
00:54:26.319 --> 00:54:27.430 align:start position:0%
there's two and i'm not accusing
um

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
ned gordon of doing this but
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
but are you
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
putting all of this in language in order
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
to use it when's when a complaint is
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
made after the fact
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know and actually and be able to use
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
it to say see this is where you went
 
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.670 align:start position:0%
it to say see this is where you went
wrong

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.710 align:start position:0%
wrong
or

00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
i would prefer
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
to prevent such activity yes the old
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
and be able to have someone
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
without having
 
00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:57.910 align:start position:0%
without having
this

00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
on their person 24 7 have someone be
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
able to say
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
i i think i know where the clear line
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
lies for
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
my family members
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
what things i can vote on what i can't
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
and and what things
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
require just disclosing and what thing i
 
00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.510 align:start position:0%
require just disclosing and what thing i
although

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
although
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
i have to agree i think with claire that
 
00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.309 align:start position:0%
i have to agree i think with claire that
disclosing

00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
disclosing
 
00:55:24.319 --> 00:55:26.150 align:start position:0%
disclosing
is

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
to the to
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
for me to the general public
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
disclosing means nothing
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
um you're either
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
and and for the same reason i've never
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
understood if your benefit is is any
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
greater than anyone else in your group
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
a benefit to you then it's a problem as
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
far as i'm concerned right and i would
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
rather err on the side of recusal than
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
the side of disclosure and
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think the public
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
for the purpose that i don't think the
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
public looks at
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
disclosure as being
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
your absolution
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll grant you that that just may be
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
my personal view no that's my view
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
i i i think disclosure without having to
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
recuse you may you may still want to
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
fill out the form the disclosure form
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
when you're filling out the forms for
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
the when you are coming into the house
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't give you a pass to vote
 
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
on things if you have a special interest
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
financial or otherwise correct
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
to vote on legislation so that almost
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
requires recusal
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
so you know maybe
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm thinking too much about it but
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
i i just have more questions now that
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
i've come in here today
 
00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:47.910 align:start position:0%
i've come in here today
than

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
i thought i had
 
00:56:49.839 --> 00:56:50.630 align:start position:0%
i thought i had
so

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
that happens a lot it with me it does
 
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.309 align:start position:0%
that happens a lot it with me it does
yeah

00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
actually probably our
 
00:56:56.799 --> 00:56:58.470 align:start position:0%
actually probably our
freshman

00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
freshman
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
legislator or
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
almost not freshman legislator
 
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
if we've dealt with this stuff for years
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
it may be more important for us to
 
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
know your view
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
is this
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
overwhelming for
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
being handed a booklet and told
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
these are your new ethics and this is
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
when you do or don't
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
i've always heard on the side of
 
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.910 align:start position:0%
i've always heard on the side of
um

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be involved in something
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
that i shouldn't be
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
what do you get from all of the
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
instruction and all of the guidance that
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
you've received
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
as to the state of when you disclose
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
when you
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
recuse is there
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
puzzled beyond include and include this
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
conversation here today i don't know
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah did we help you at all did this
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
help does this make it more confusing or
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
well i think that it brought up some
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be looked into yeah
 
00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.789 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be looked into yeah
um

00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
in a previous conversation
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
it was said that we need to bring the
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
language down to
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
a level where everybody gets it
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
you know there was even some bills that
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
came up this past year that i asked my
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
chairman you know should i recuse
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
because again i'd rather fall on
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
the side of
 
00:58:35.839 --> 00:58:37.190 align:start position:0%
the side of
safety

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
and being above board than
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
to just
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
you know wing it yeah
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
were you given
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
it's been a while since any of us were
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
had gone through orientation
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
um i'm not even sure
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
are you giving the orientation
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
conversation or usually been part of it
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't last time but but chairman
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
gordon did
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
for the house and on the senate side he
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
did it with rick lehman oh okay
 
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.030 align:start position:0%
did it with rick lehman oh okay
um

00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
well both
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
both being attorneys um
 
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know you're getting
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
you're getting the um
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
that i don't know if it's even the
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
client attorney
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
conversation you know don't answer that
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wondering whether the
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
instruction that you're getting that
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
comes from this book
 
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:34.870 align:start position:0%
comes from this book
is

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
suitable for you to be able to make
 
00:59:37.119 --> 00:59:38.549 align:start position:0%
suitable for you to be able to make
decisions

00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
well if we outgoing to me and asking if
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
we went by just the book alone
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's already been said that there's no
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
fine line to recuse
 
00:59:48.319 --> 00:59:49.910 align:start position:0%
fine line to recuse
so

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
if they're teaching from the book
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
recusal wouldn't even come up right in
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
the teaching correct
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's how i understand it
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
we find that surprising
 
01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.230 align:start position:0%
we find that surprising
i

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
i do yeah i think most people the
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
general public would find that
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
surprising as well all you have to do is
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
announce and then it's okay to go vote
 
01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.069 align:start position:0%
announce and then it's okay to go vote
and

01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
that i think is the problem that we're
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.710 align:start position:0%
trying to
eliminate

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
um does that
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
so where do we go from here we can do
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
this all day long um do we
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
do we
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
look over the summer for things that
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
and continue to talk to
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
and read the
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
50 other states and find things that we
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
think should be in here
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
or do we simply jump over the
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
should go forward
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
or do we
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the will of the work
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
session i don't know that we should say
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
the legislation should go forward
 
01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.510 align:start position:0%
the legislation should go forward
study

01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
should be done
 
01:01:01.359 --> 01:01:02.390 align:start position:0%
should be done
on

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.750 align:start position:0%
on
ethics

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.190 align:start position:0%
ethics
definitions

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
and recusal
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
another study is similar to 2014 or well
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
we have to have somebody i mean what is
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
it that the folks put together here how
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
did that come out come about was it
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
because of just the ethics committee do
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
you need a study or do you need just the
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
ethics committee revisiting the issues
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
that we've brought up today with
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
definitions and adding we know we have
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
recusal in here which is good is this
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
bill the product of the ethics committee
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
i i don't know he he certainly kept them
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the loop and talked about it at the
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
committee meetings
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
i don't recall that there was never a
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
vote endorsing it that i can recall
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
they did seem to be in support of it i
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
know that representative wall is on it
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't know why senator carson or
 
01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.390 align:start position:0%
and i don't know why senator carson or
senator

01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
rosenwald aren't but i they were asked
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
maybe things happened too quickly or
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
something but they seem to be in support
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
it's kind of an odd committee anyway
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
it's not uh
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
it's not a statutory committee
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's sort of i think it is yeah it is so
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a standing committee it's a
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
statutory committee and it is
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
but the membership seems to
 
01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:25.029 align:start position:0%
but the membership seems to
remain

01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
remain
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
pretty constant um there's actually uh
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's almost a commission too right
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
there's non-legislation three public
 
01:02:32.079 --> 01:02:36.470 align:start position:0%
there's non-legislation three public
members

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
it it's
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
i i think it's unique
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
um but i don't know
 
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.750 align:start position:0%
um but i don't know
um

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
i don't think that really changes how we
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
are looking at
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
the bill before us right
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
i think i think
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
the idea of recusal is good but even in
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
the recusal section of the bill this
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
definitions that have to come in
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
would be defined
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
remuneration even with the household
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
definition the household definition in
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
in statute currently needs to remove the
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
common economic interest because we
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
don't know what that is and it's not
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
defined anywhere we can imagine what it
 
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.750 align:start position:0%
defined anywhere we can imagine what it
is

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
and we also have to
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
really sure up
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not we have a a
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
a special interest
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
or if we have a non-financial or
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
financial interest
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
those help to be all defined and only
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
once those are all defined can you go
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
back and decide whether or not what
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to do with this ethics book
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a recusal section
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
in this book which i think they need
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's my take on it whether it's done
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
with a commission whether it's done by
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
the committee the ethics committee
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's currently in place
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
or whether it's done by ned gordon cindy
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
rosenwald sharing constant and janet
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
wall i don't know but we here sitting
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
the four of us
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
this isn't it
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
but there's also in this book
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
this is the charge of the evidence
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
committee right yes create this book and
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
policies right and policies right by
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
their child but
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
but this bill
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
is putting it into statute
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
correct which is part of this booklet
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's in all the statutes right
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
but even if we pass this as as it stands
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
it still needs to get into this book by
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
the ethics committee
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
they they are the ones that take and put
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
the statute into this book well clearly
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's true but if we give them language
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's going to be statute
 
01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.349 align:start position:0%
that's going to be statute
language

01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to fix that
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
and comply with all the other issues
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
so even if we pass this bill we've not
 
01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.309 align:start position:0%
so even if we pass this bill we've not
done

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
justice to editing this book
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
just a thought well if you amended the
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
two statutes we would change them in
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
here to reflect what's current
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
so if we change the definitions and and
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
in statute it would it would drive
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
now one place you could have less volume
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
here is if we remove the procedural
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
rules which only are really come into
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
play for a complaint
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
but we was always thought everything
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
should be in this booklet
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
even though it does make it longer
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
that important to the other committee
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
as a side note whenever i ask someone a
 
01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:47.430 align:start position:0%
as a side note whenever i ask someone a
doe

01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
doe
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
a question and then they say it's on the
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
website um
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
just because it's on the website doesn't
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
mean i can find it and doesn't mean that
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't absolve you of the
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility of telling me what the
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
answer to my question is i mean
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know it used to be a cartoon
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
and the fella said at one point a point
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
in every direction is the same as no
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
point at all um
 
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.589 align:start position:0%
point at all um
it's

01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
it's true
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
putting it in the book doesn't
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
help if it serves to intimidate someone
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
from sitting down and reading whatever
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
68 pages
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
maybe we should have a second
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
publication that would be a shorter
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
version of
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
yeah the cliff notes yeah
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
um otherwise we're going to get close to
 
01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.549 align:start position:0%
um otherwise we're going to get close to
uh

01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
you know having the manual of
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
ethics over here
 
01:06:41.119 --> 01:06:42.150 align:start position:0%
ethics over here
um

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't i you know i still want
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
in my in my perfect world i want a
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
little laminated card that tells
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
somebody yeah you've gotta
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
you've gotta not
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
you gotta stay clear of this issue and i
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's hard we need to create an app for
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
that so as i see it there are one two
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
three four five six definitions that
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
need to be looked at and revised
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
household number household has to be
 
01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:11.829 align:start position:0%
household number household has to be
revised

01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
revised
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
um common economic interest
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
which is in the household definition
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
remuneration right or yeah financial
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
interest maybe not defined remuneration
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
it just may be
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
it needs to be using
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
well but it may just be eliminated and
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
use the existing
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
could use could yeah
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
so either define or eliminate it right
 
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.710 align:start position:0%
so either define or eliminate it right
okay

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh so financial and non-financial if if
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
you're going to go with what's in this
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
bill now
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
but this bill is not going to be going
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
forward because there's all these other
 
01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.549 align:start position:0%
forward because there's all these other
things

01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
and special interests remove the greater
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
benefit language
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
so we've got household
 
01:07:57.359 --> 01:07:58.710 align:start position:0%
so we've got household
which

01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
which economic interest is defined
 
01:08:06.799 --> 01:08:07.670 align:start position:0%
which economic interest is defined
um

01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
or changed to financial or non-financial
 
01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:12.230 align:start position:0%
or changed to financial or non-financial
interest

01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.630 align:start position:0%
interest
right

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh then financial non-financial
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
remuneration either define it or remove
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
it or change it and special interest
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
remove the greater benefit because i
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
don't think special interest putting
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
that language in is helpful
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
and currently it would add substantially
 
01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:28.229 align:start position:0%
and currently it would add substantially
greater

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
greater
 
01:08:28.239 --> 01:08:33.110 align:start position:0%
greater
benefit

01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking for me i don't like that
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
one i don't like it at all at all to
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
generals if it's your how are you gonna
 
01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.870 align:start position:0%
generals if it's your how are you gonna
know

01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
what's it what we don't we don't
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
actually to one
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
and you know and so quite frankly
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna have that language
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank baba
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
we want to make things work
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
we can do it
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
you can call me
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
well you know
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
um if as soon as you are getting a
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
benefit it doesn't matter whether it's
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
benefit is greater or less than someone
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
else's it's you're getting a benefit
 
01:09:11.679 --> 01:09:12.470 align:start position:0%
else's it's you're getting a benefit
that's

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.430 align:start position:0%
that's my
upbringing

01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be an issue of
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
drawing in the line though for example
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
yeah a bill that affects the property
 
01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.630 align:start position:0%
yeah a bill that affects the property
tax

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.910 align:start position:0%
tax
or

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
well with the business taxes yes
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
or money going back to municipalities or
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
something like that correct there should
 
01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:39.510 align:start position:0%
something like that correct there should
be

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
exceptions or something along those
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
lines because there are bills uh look
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
look at last year when we had the silly
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills um
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
it's possible that there's one little
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
thing in there and you're
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
now not able to vote on the entire you
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
know 32 sections of a bill
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.390 align:start position:0%
i don't
how

01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
how has that ever hit
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's always just been handled by
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
disclosure yes and the idea that so many
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
people are affected by the property tax
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
and still substantial peoples affected
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
by the bet and bpt
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
or the real estate transfer attacks
 
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:20.790 align:start position:0%
or the real estate transfer attacks
that

01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
unless it affects you more than others
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
in that group
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
disclosure on the financial disclosure
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
form and making the verbal disclosure at
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
certain points is enough
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
but that takes away the the idea of um
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
coalition in this state retirement
 
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.550 align:start position:0%
coalition in this state retirement
system

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
right i mean that's the that's the
 
01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.149 align:start position:0%
right i mean that's the that's the
trade-off

01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
trade-off
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
currently you could vote on that unless
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
it affected you more than other members
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the retirement system
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
but not under not under this bill
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
and how was that quantified is it on a
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
percentage basis
 
01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.070 align:start position:0%
percentage basis
because

01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
are you using a yardstick or a meter
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
stick it's the same well
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
you can make the argument this is how
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
silly it gets you can make the argument
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
that if you retire at 55
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
you have a greater benefit than the
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
person that retires at 65. so you know
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
where's the thermometer and where's the
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
level and how do you get that
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
information in order to make that
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
determination so you see
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
where we're
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're in the weeds of it now where we
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
didn't want to be correct and you know
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
we do need exceptions i got i got the
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
bep the property tax i got all that
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise we would no legislator would
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
be able to vote on the budget it
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a quorum and so there we go
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
so you know we have a problem with that
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
so we do need exceptions
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
but not when you have
 
01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:49.990 align:start position:0%
but not when you have
um

01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
a financial interest
 
01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.430 align:start position:0%
a financial interest
in

01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
you know with the household with the
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
financial the non-finding all of that
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
stuff and there needs to be recusal
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
i agree with with ned gordon and janet
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
wall on that bill i agree there needs to
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
be and i because i think the people of
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
our state thinks that there is
 
01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
i do i think they think that there's
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
recusal you're not voting on that so
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit concerning to them
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
i would imagine well i get calls from
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
the public all the time wondering if
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
they should file a complaint and so what
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
i do is i lead them to the provisions
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
on their website and when they they
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
because they have a much different
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
concept of conflict of interest than
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
sure is reality yeah and so they're
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
disappointed when they hear
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
how limited the definition is and so
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's been going on for 30 years
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
well right you know well perception is
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
reality right yeah that
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
that ten that
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
the reason that or the explanation that
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
you're hearing from these people saying
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
that they're disappointed
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's what leads them to lump
 
01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.350 align:start position:0%
that's what leads them to lump
legislators

01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
whether the state or federal in that
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're all in it they're all
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
crooked they're all you know and that's
 
01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:08.790 align:start position:0%
crooked they're all you know and that's
what

01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's what i would like to take a
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
starter line i think yes
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
and i think the ethics booklet was a
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
start but i think that you know the four
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
of us sitting here
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
chatting is like
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
what's happening yeah yeah
 
01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.070 align:start position:0%
what's happening yeah yeah
so

01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
again i i'll ask the question where do
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
we go from here what um sounds like
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
you're looking forward and we what are
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
our options again
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
recommend or not recommend recommend
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
that this is um
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
that the committee recommends for future
 
01:13:48.159 --> 01:13:50.070 align:start position:0%
that the committee recommends for future
legislation

01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
suggestions for that future legislation
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
which is our definitions
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
and exceptions
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
and and somewhere
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
we've got to have a conversation or have
 
01:14:04.719 --> 01:14:06.229 align:start position:0%
we've got to have a conversation or have
a

01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
how do we resolve the issue
 
01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:09.990 align:start position:0%
how do we resolve the issue
that

01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
rich just brought up
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
where is that balancing point when
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
you've got
 
01:14:15.679 --> 01:14:17.189 align:start position:0%
you've got
um

01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
people we need we need people to vote on
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
yep but we believe
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
that versus quorum
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
we believe that it's not right for
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
someone to vote on a cost of living
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
increase on the pension so
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
how do you
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
how do you do one and not affect the
 
01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.550 align:start position:0%
how do you do one and not affect the
other

01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
i don't i i'd be happy to
 
01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.510 align:start position:0%
i don't i i'd be happy to
entertain

01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
entertain
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
thoughts on i think i think like i said
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think these four people sitting
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
here at the same table
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
well it
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.790 align:start position:0%
it should be
actually

01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
i get it we've got legislation but i
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
think that the committee the commission
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that we have that's
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
written the ethics that
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
mr lambert is here
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
right i think they need to be looking at
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
what we recommend
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
coming out of this
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
well but they can turn around
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
um there's there's no reason why ned's
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
bill couldn't just be resubmitted the
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
way it is
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.149 align:start position:0%
 
our

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
our report
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
for november
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
will say
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
generally that it shouldn't go
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
as it's written right just whether
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
between the lines or in the actual fact
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
it it should be changed in some way yes
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
yes it needs to change so then the
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
question is rather than wait for another
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
year um
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
how do
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
do we want to
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
as a committee or on an ad hoc basis
 
01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.430 align:start position:0%
as a committee or on an ad hoc basis
create

01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
create
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
our our version of what it should say
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i don't feel comfortable
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
quite frankly creating our version of
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
what it should happen because i'm
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
telling you well we basically are well
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
but no i mean i could go through this
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
ethics book
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
make changes on probably every page
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's not a good thing i have no doubt
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
that that's not a good thing
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
but i think that we can make suggestions
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
of what needs to happen to any future
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
legislation such as
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
honing in on the definitions
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
put in exceptions for legislators
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
um in in future legislation but i think
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
recusal is an important part of this
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that needs to be there
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
somehow if we can say that
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
then that gives direction to the whoever
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
it is that's doing it because i really i
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
have i don't feel competent
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
not knowing the background in the
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
history and attended these meetings i
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
just don't
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
and any
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
changes that we may suggest um from what
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
i gather will
 
01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:04.470 align:start position:0%
i gather will
trigger

01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
trigger
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
a rewrite and republication of these
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
rules and i think
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
the booklet if whatever we pass correct
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
will change maybe that's that's what i
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
but if we recommend this move forward
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
with the particular uh augmentations
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
that we've described right clarification
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
of definitions that the exceptions for
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
taxation and uh similar bep
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
real estate property taxes etc um
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
domicile issue
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
and balancing the ethics and the quorum
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh with recusal and making sure
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
we end up with a small card or an app
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
that we can give to these uh legislators
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
to make things a little bit easier it's
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
easier to said than done though yeah
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's much easier said than done i
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't end up with the same just the
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
simple thing of saying a recusal on the
 
01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:56.149 align:start position:0%
simple thing of saying a recusal on the
budget

01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:17:56.159 --> 01:17:56.950 align:start position:0%
budget
or

01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
an omnibus bill how do you
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
one item in there that's a problem you
 
01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.550 align:start position:0%
one item in there that's a problem you
can

01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
just disclose whatever address you know
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
maybe you know
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's a mayor's a simple majority you get
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
17 issues if the in there if you get
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
conflicts with three you're good to vote
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
is that how i'm well you can't
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
yeah but that's never going to happen we
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have omnibus bills anyway
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's my thing hello
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
but the budget is an omnibus bill well
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
it it it's
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
one it has turned into one
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
i understand and and this ethics bill
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
has to deal with the budget
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
we have no we i suspect it won't be as
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
omnibus like
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
i have no idea i don't think any of us
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
are going to believe it for a second it
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter it's it's
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
it the ethics rules have to deal with
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
an omnibus or a budget type bill and we
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
and and somewhere these guys or us
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
have to say what
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
what does the legislator do when he's
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
faced with that situation and maybe
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
if we put in there that the legislature
 
01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
if we put in there that the legislature
legislator

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
can in fact recuse and not vote on it
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
then perhaps the folks putting together
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
the budget will be more careful of what
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
goes in it
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
i like dreaming that's okay i like to
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
dream yeah um
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
any normal just saying um so i kind of
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
wish um
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding and
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you being here greatly but
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
because we would have been just sitting
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
but ned gordon um
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
is a is a key player
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
in this and um
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:19:45.199 --> 01:19:47.030 align:start position:0%
and i think
maybe

01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
we understand
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
um in for september and say
 
01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:52.229 align:start position:0%
um in for september and say
we that

01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
when we wrap this up
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
um does that sound right yeah that
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we could if we could take the
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
notes that were that were drafted by the
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
clerk and make sure that the
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
that the rest of the committee has those
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
notes and that
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
that ned has those notes so that he
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
could be prepared for
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
those kind of links to the video
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
why are you because i will have to be
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
careful with the dates i've got some
 
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
major trips going here september is a
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
period oh i i may i said september yeah
 
01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.270 align:start position:0%
period oh i i may i said september yeah
okay

01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
we only need it
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
by november first
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay and then it's in my lap okay
 
01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:41.990 align:start position:0%
okay and then it's in my lap okay
um

01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
great i appreciate it again thank you
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
very much for all of your assistance um
 
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:47.669 align:start position:0%
very much for all of your assistance um
any

01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
comments questions or
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
or thoughts that you have that would
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
help us
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
um i hope i didn't make it more
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
confusing but i mean it sort of is that
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
way inherently so yes um there were some
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
other issues
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
do you want to just keep the bill
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
limited to i shouldn't say limited too
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
but only about recusal because there
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
were a couple of other
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
issues that the committee has in which
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
may have been something they would have
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
addressed in the senate from that
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
legislation no
 
01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.629 align:start position:0%
legislation no
um

01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
the committee would like the ability to
 
01:21:22.639 --> 01:21:26.830 align:start position:0%
the committee would like the ability to
admonish

01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
respondents um following an initial
 
01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.590 align:start position:0%
respondents um following an initial
review

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm just throwing that out there yeah
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
totally different than recusal
 
01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:36.950 align:start position:0%
totally different than recusal
um

01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
is there any of this
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
in anything other than committee minutes
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
or no can we get a copy of those
 
01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.950 align:start position:0%
or no can we get a copy of those
committees

01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
not we didn't get to that point no but
 
01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.510 align:start position:0%
not we didn't get to that point no but
following

01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
following
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
the next step in a complaint which is
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
preliminary investigation
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
can have an informal resolution with the
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
agreement of the respondent and then
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
they can admonish
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's been a whole lot of complaints
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
this past
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
year and a half
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
which are relating to legislator
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
misconduct particularly on social media
 
01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.790 align:start position:0%
misconduct particularly on social media
sites

01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
sites
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
and there's the speaker's
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
special committee which
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
handles some misbehavior issues
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
and on that the speaker can write a
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
letter of caution
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
which he's done
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
but the committee can't do that
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
currently under its
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
provisions for complaints
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
at the at the initial level of initial
 
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.870 align:start position:0%
at the at the initial level of initial
review

01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
and so the committee felt and they all
 
01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.229 align:start position:0%
and so the committee felt and they all
agreed

01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
that it would be helpful to have that
 
01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.350 align:start position:0%
that it would be helpful to have that
tool

01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
tool
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
where they could admonish
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
at the first level
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
even without the respondents agreement
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
if they've done something that
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't rise the level of going forward
 
01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.110 align:start position:0%
doesn't rise the level of going forward
to

01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know reprimand expulsion
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
or accenture but at a lower level i'm
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
just saying that something that is it is
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
it something less than censure yes
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be voted on by the body it
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
would just be from the committee and and
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
so this presumably would come through
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
the special committee if the special
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
committee exists in in perpetuity here
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
it would come through that special
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee and be referred to
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
no well it could be no this would be a
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
separate that special committee can do
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
their own thing
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
but this would be for complaints the
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
ethics committee which are in their
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction yeah
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
um they could have the ability to
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
admonish a member
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
and then close out the complaint
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm trying to find out is
 
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
could this complaint to the ethics
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
committee be running concurrently with
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
the special committee or is this a a
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
continuation of that process through
 
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:52.790 align:start position:0%
continuation of that process through
the

01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
the special committee to the ethics
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
committee this would be separate for the
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
ethics committee okay
 
01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.430 align:start position:0%
ethics committee okay
yep

01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
just a quick thought
 
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
rather than putting in admonish
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
in our
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
interest to say something about review
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
remedies available to the ethics
 
01:24:12.639 --> 01:24:14.149 align:start position:0%
remedies available to the ethics
committee

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
rather than us saying it in
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
so they so then they would handle that
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
under that caption review remedies
 
01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.189 align:start position:0%
under that caption review remedies
available

01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
yes is that okay okay
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
cause i you know
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
the remedies already in this that you
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
have available already in here yes
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay um under
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
both the procedural rules and also the
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
statute if you go to page 28 complaint
 
01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.750 align:start position:0%
statute if you go to page 28 complaint
procedures

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
actually page at the top of 29
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
it talks about upon the completion of
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
the preliminary investigation which is
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
the second stage of a complaint
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
the first is the initial review and so
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
to get to the preliminary investigation
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
the committee needs to vote
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
by majority vote to take it to that
 
01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.550 align:start position:0%
by majority vote to take it to that
level

01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
there you can have an informal
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
resolution and it can include
 
01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:09.350 align:start position:0%
resolution and it can include
um

01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
um actually it's not the first paragraph
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
7b

01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
7b
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh written advice or admonishment
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
remedial action so forth
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
so we could put in in
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
in our little game to review the
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
remedies available and make
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations okay and then you could
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
take care of that and whoever it is in
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
future legislation coming forward would
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
that be is that right
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
if we put something in our i don't know
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
i phased out on that say that again
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
please i'm sorry that's what
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
you wanted about admonishment and we're
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
looking at uh page 29 of the ethics
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
rules yeah under seven
 
01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.030 align:start position:0%
rules yeah under seven
they

01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
for us toward it
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
put something in there it is a
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
thing i think we are making
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations well it does say
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
admonishment in here such informal
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
resolution may take the form of written
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
advice or admonishment yeah but if the
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
committee can't do it it can only be
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
done by the speaker right no the
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
committee can do this
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to say is it can only do
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
it at a different stage of a complaint
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
and with the approval the consent
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
of the respondent you want to be able to
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
upon initial investigation or something
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
initial review and and
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
circumvent the
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
the approval of the
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the complaint
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes or the subject of the complaint
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
because the committee would the thought
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
is this whatever they did doesn't rise
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
to the level of going any further
 
01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:47.030 align:start position:0%
to the level of going any further
why

01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
why why would we ever
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
why would we ever have the consent of
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
because if they say no
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's a formal hearing which is like a
 
01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.110 align:start position:0%
it's a formal hearing which is like a
trial

01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
trial
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then through at the end of that
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
point the committee recommends to the
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
house or the senate
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
reprimand censure or expulsion
 
01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.189 align:start position:0%
reprimand censure or expulsion
okay

01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
got it
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
would i ask you about two more things
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
too yeah
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
in the booklet here
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
there's the harassment policy of the
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
general court
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
toward the end
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
and it's not totally clear that the
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
committee has the jurisdiction to
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
enforce this
 
01:27:39.199 --> 01:27:49.430 align:start position:0%
enforce this
page

01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
why did ned not include things like this
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
in here or is it just he was keeping it
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
limited to the request okay an issue
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
good too
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
this was passed by the facilities
 
01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.470 align:start position:0%
this was passed by the facilities
committee

01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
it was never voted on by the house
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
or the senate it's not a law
 
01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.750 align:start position:0%
or the senate it's not a law
and

01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
in the in the there is a piece of
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
legislation which requires that this be
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the ethics booklet yeah but there's
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
nothing that states this is the
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
committee's jurisdiction to enforce this
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay in fact
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to have to refer you back
 
01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.270 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to have to refer you back
again

01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.229 align:start position:0%
again
but

01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:24.239 --> 01:28:26.830 align:start position:0%
but
in

01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.629 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
definitions of jurisdiction of the
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.719 --> 01:28:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
25.

01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
there was a specific amendment
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
to jurisdiction of the committee a few
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
which limited the committee's
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to not include rules
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know i think i i i think we can go
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
crazy with this right now i think you're
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
gonna have to do
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
i don't want to speak for the whole
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
people but i think you can opinion is
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
when we're doing this and having our
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
next meeting
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
in september or whatever october
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
whatever it is
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
we need to have this kind of laid out by
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
folks that come in with things that may
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
help us to make our decision in that
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
other session that we have
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
because for me to sit here and write
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
everything down like this september i'm
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
going to say you know
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
a short
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
well i almost think that one of the
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
future legislation dealing with
 
01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.229 align:start position:0%
future legislation dealing with
abcd

01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
abcd
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
so that correct so that it's it is i
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
don't i don't think we need
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
there's no advantage to having it added
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
to the existing
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that we're dealing with
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
i i think it would i'll certainly work
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
in a and it's been a fresh build in a
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
set well all of this has to be a fresh
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
bill but in a separate bill um
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:02.790 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
there's issues with all of those um
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
i'd like to investigate why
 
01:30:13.199 --> 01:30:14.629 align:start position:0%
i'd like to investigate why
um

01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:14.639 --> 01:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
um
rules

01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't added to your authority i i'd
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
like to know removed you know all of
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff i'd like to know
 
01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.149 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff i'd like to know
whether

01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
the special committee that was set up by
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
the speaker will be
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
something that will handle the sexual um
 
01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.990 align:start position:0%
something that will handle the sexual um
discrimination

01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
i don't want to confuse what i think is
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
a good
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
start here by adding
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
i just wanted you to be aware of them
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
and then have a bunch of people recuse
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
themselves from voting on it because
 
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.430 align:start position:0%
themselves from voting on it because
they're

01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
a whole nother story um
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
are we good
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
which is the beginning of the guidelines
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
principles of public service
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
i know i'm giving you a laundry list of
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
problems now but
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
the question is are those too vague to
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
be enforced and one member of the
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
committee in particular um
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
david hess
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
as david hess yeah has really um he
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
articulated this very clearly better
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
than i can do but
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
we have gotten all of these complaints
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:47.669 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:47.679 --> 01:31:49.430 align:start position:0%
and
it's

01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
the ethics committee invited the speaker
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
and representative walner to come and
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
talk and and have discussion about
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that that we've got 11
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
complaints last year and about half a
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
dozen this year
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
on on based on this
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
and it's the committee's thought that
 
01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:08.950 align:start position:0%
and it's the committee's thought that
really

01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
because a member of the public is saying
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
the legislator was rude to me
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
he violated principle four i'm filing a
 
01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.669 align:start position:0%
he violated principle four i'm filing a
complaint

01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
and the committee says well
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
we're not sure this is really
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
something that we can enforce in terms
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
of a complaint because these are more
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
general and aspirational
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
in nature even though the word shall is
 
01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.470 align:start position:0%
in nature even though the word shall is
there

01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's created some
 
01:32:34.639 --> 01:32:36.070 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's created some
bad

01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
bad
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
as you were speaking representative
 
01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.590 align:start position:0%
as you were speaking representative
about

01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
the public image this is really i think
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
hurting the committee with the public
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
to the extent that this was known at
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
least from those who filed the
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
complaints which are confidential
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
that they file a complaint into this and
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
the committee says i'm sorry we don't
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
really have jurisdiction to help you
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
with that yes the legislator was rude
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
they did something on social media they
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
posted this that or the other thing on
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
social media or they yelled at you on
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
the phone or use curse words or whatever
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
all these things happen
 
01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.110 align:start position:0%
all these things happen
and

01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
we'll say well i'm sorry
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
so i guess the question is
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
what do policymakers want to do
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
with these four principles of public
 
01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.310 align:start position:0%
with these four principles of public
service

01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
tell them they should adhere to that um
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
did um
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
did david have a thought
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
on on four of
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
all of them he said they're they're all
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
all of them not just for root for
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
vagueness i think is the legal term he
 
01:33:38.719 --> 01:33:39.750 align:start position:0%
vagueness i think is the legal term he
used

01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:41.270 align:start position:0%
used
just

01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
well he didn't suggest that but he
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
i guess making clear that just general
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's a wish list it's not a
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's nothing that can be enforced i
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
guess is what
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing go
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's my last laundry list
 
01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:04.629 align:start position:0%
that's my last laundry list
well

01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
i think that this principle of public
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
but really what do you do yeah i mean we
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
take an oath to the constitution i mean
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's our hope
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
right we're not taking an oath to the
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
the ethics committee can remove this all
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
on their own the guidelines can be
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
amended by the committee but it has to
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
be approved by the house and senate it
 
01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:55.350 align:start position:0%
be approved by the house and senate it
does

01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
this book is in your
 
01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:12.470 align:start position:0%
this book is in your
jurisdiction

01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
are um
 
01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.189 align:start position:0%
are um
27

01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%

01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
page 27
 
01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:25.030 align:start position:0%
page 27
um

01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%

before guidelines and amendments become
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
effective the committee shall distribute
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%

guidelines to the members i've read this
before

01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
um specific guidelines or amendments
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
shall be brought to a vote and approved
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
by a majority vote of both houses
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
within a period of three legislative
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
days after distribution before they
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
i would make this almost
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
i would make this a separate bill and i
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
would make this
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
almost like we do
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
a cacr but you know it's a it is it's a
 
01:36:18.719 --> 01:36:20.550 align:start position:0%
a cacr but you know it's a it is it's a
very

01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's just a this is a guideline huh yeah
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
ethics guidelines it doesn't belong in
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines though
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
the um principles
 
01:36:40.239 --> 01:36:42.149 align:start position:0%
the um principles
yeah

01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
and complaints have been founded on
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
those too over the years
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
the ethics study commission looked at
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
this and previously ford didn't exist
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
and the other three used the word should
 
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
instead of shall
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
and so the commit the commission thought
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
that by changing that word
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
they were making these
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
um mandatory and something that the
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee couldn't enforce but the
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
current ethics committee and others who
 
01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:09.350 align:start position:0%
current ethics committee and others who
have

01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
presented arguments to the committee on
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
behalf of respondents
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
have stated that they thought this was
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
too vague to be enforced because it's
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
not giving the um
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
legislator any goal posts as to what is
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
acceptable and what is not
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
what would happen if you just simply
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
that could be as a as a
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
um a goal
 
01:37:37.119 --> 01:37:38.790 align:start position:0%
um a goal
um

01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
bring that before the um
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
no that would if he changed that to
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
should we that would still have to come
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
before the house
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
how's the senate because you're changing
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
the guidelines and the guidelines
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
according here before guidelines or
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
amendments are become effective they
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
have to be voted on by a majority but it
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
should be a fairly
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
i would think it would be a voice vote
 
01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:08.790 align:start position:0%
i would think it would be a voice vote
but

01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
it's a statutory change i mean it's
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
um the principles are part of the
 
01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.910 align:start position:0%
um the principles are part of the
guidelines

01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
oh that yeah 27 is 14 b3 statute
 
01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:26.629 align:start position:0%
oh that yeah 27 is 14 b3 statute
right

01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
no we're not changing
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
we're not changing how the rule is how
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
the guideline is done we're changing
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
so you're going to change this no no
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to leave this special boat
 
01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:44.229 align:start position:0%
you're going to leave this special boat
yes

01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
yes you're just changing the guide
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
because you're changing the guideline
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
that that speaks to
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
not changing how the guidelines are are
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
done you're changing
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
just the guideline
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
should it be
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
statutory change
 
01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.189 align:start position:0%

according to this it shouldn't
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
i didn't know if any future entity would
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
want to recommend that some something be
 
01:39:23.189 --> 01:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
done there that's all
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%

01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
