page that deals with

one of the objections that was raised
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
during the committee conference process
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%

domestic violence
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
orders and the protections that would

need to be in place
 
00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:54.230 align:start position:0%
need to be in place
for

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
for

individuals that have these orders
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the s at the next um proposed change
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
is on the second pay the third page
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
which is a savings provision
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
which states that if
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the event
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
that any of the terms or provisions of
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
this act
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
are declared invalid or unenforceable by
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
any court of competent jurisdiction the
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
remaining terms and provisions that are
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
now affected thereby shall remain in
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
full force in effect in construing this
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
provision a court shall make such ruling
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
in a manner that favors retaining the
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
enforceability of any remaining terms to
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
the greatest extent possible that is the
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
senate version of house bill 1431 that
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
we are standing behind and we ask that
 
00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:44.230 align:start position:0%
we are standing behind and we ask that
the

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%

00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
like something
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
you often see referred to as a
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
severability clause is there a
 
00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:57.910 align:start position:0%
severability clause is there a
difference

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
amendment right now okay i just want to
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
i will note on this amendment um
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
there have been significant concerns
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
raised about the
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
bill passed by the senate uh raised by
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
community that have absolutely not been
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
addressed by this we are still going to
 
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.590 align:start position:0%
addressed by this we are still going to
be

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
outing children
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
against their will
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
in schools
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
and potentially you know sending them
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
into a situation at home that we don't
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
know may be volatile maybe unaffirming
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that this bill is
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
antithetical to all the work we have
 
00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:54.790 align:start position:0%
antithetical to all the work we have
done

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
in the state to ensure
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh that individuals in this community in
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
the lgbt community can live a life free
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
from discrimination and and uh and be
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
safe in their own communities this is
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
antithetical to that and i'm i'm sorry
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%

identities right there
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's the part that was identified to
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
us by national and local lgbt community
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%

00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
not hearing none any further discussion
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
on any other part of this amendment mr
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
chair go ahead i will say also this is
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
antithetical to all the work that the
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
state has done to build a system of care
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
for children with mental health we have
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
right now a an elevated
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
number of children seeking mental health
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
just last time i checked we had 10
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
children waiting in emergency rooms for
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
care not able to get treatment and so
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
now we are going to elevate this problem
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
by creating situations where lgbt kids
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
are scared to go to school scared to be
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
added by their parents
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
and elevating issues we know that are uh
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
we know the lgbt community has
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
heightened mental health issues and
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to only make this better
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead the senator is speaking to
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
testimony that we did not get in the
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
committee and this is something that i
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
spoke about on tuesday
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
that all during this process
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
we have been open available to
 
00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:58.390 align:start position:0%
we have been open available to
individuals

00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
this is a fight that we've already had
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
on the floor of the senate
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
and to bring it forward at this point i
 
00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:05.350 align:start position:0%
and to bring it forward at this point i
think

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
is an attempt to derail this legislation
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's appropriate but
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
you are the chair and you get to make
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
that ruling not not me
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
so i i i had offered potential language
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
um and i would like to see us um discuss
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
this language
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
this language change the underlying bill
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
has not changed these were just
 
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.630 align:start position:0%
has not changed these were just
additions

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
additions
 
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.590 align:start position:0%
additions
that

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
we heard especially on the domestic
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
violence that there were some concerns
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
made by the house and so we have
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
language here that we would like the
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
house to consider
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the senate attending to
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the house do you have
 
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.590 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the house do you have
any

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.789 align:start position:0%
any
discussion

00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
there's been information brought forward
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
concerning the fact that some of the
 
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.350 align:start position:0%
concerning the fact that some of the
employees

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
of a school district may have
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
conversations with children
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
and those employees
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
are not licensed
 
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.230 align:start position:0%
are not licensed
to

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
these employees are
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
employees of the community in which
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer is the potential boss
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
or a person who pays their salaries
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
so i do agree
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
that if it is an unlicensed person that
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
these children spoke to
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
it is not their responsibility to
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
withhold that information
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
if a child needs psychiatric care they
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
i like
 
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.830 align:start position:0%
i like
um

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
roman numeral three
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
and section three
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh and that's at this time off i have to
 
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.549 align:start position:0%
uh and that's at this time off i have to
say

00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative any
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes mr chair
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
i think uh let's let senator gannon have
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
a turn sure i'll just go back to g
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
because that was what we were discussing
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
um all the parents i know myself
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
included parent of four public school
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
kids graduates and still attending we
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
want to know what's going on with our
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
kids i trust in the parents of new
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire unless there's a specific
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
issue that needs to deal with a mandated
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
reporter i want to know everything going
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
on in my kids life as much as possible
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'm the one there from cradle to grave i
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
encourage them the most the 15 or 20
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
teachers that are different every year a
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
different group they don't have the
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
caring interests they don't know my
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
child like i do i'm the one responsible
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
for them the child doesn't have capacity
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
in his own to give up whether or not
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
he's going to get certain medical
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
treatment i want to know what's going on
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
in my kid's life so do the people in new
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire thank you i think so i think
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh pretty clear that when children
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
do need help their best chance of
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
getting that is when their parents know
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on right
 
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.029 align:start position:0%
what's going on right
senator

00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i agree i am i'm
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
a mom myself i want to know what's going
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
on with my child and i work with my
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
school to to do that but the problem is
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
is that not every child has a safe home
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
not every child has safe parents i have
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
spent my career trying to protect
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
children and
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
and this is again antithetical to the
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
safety of children and i will note that
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
you know just two years ago just two
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
we amended as a legislature uh rsa 169
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
c2 and we said that
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
in in in this is the child protection
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
statute that we need to provide for the
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child and the child
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
shall be the primary consideration
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
right so this isn't moving this was an
 
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.390 align:start position:0%
right so this isn't moving this was an
important

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
bipartisan move to prioritize the needs
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
of our state's most vulnerable
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
population and we are going backwards we
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
know that our lgbt youth are some of our
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable and we know that not all
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
of them have safe homes we know
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
that some of their parents are not
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
accepting we know that many are
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
accepting but why would we do something
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
to jeopardize the safety of children
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
right now i also want to say that of
 
00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:35.919 align:start position:0%
course i believe in parents fundamental
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
rights i am a parent myself i understand
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
i know so many wonderful parents but we
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
this whole bill there's nothing in here
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
nothing about the interests of children
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
nothing in here about a child's right to
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
safety nothing in here about a child's
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
right to receive an
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
education and i just fear that
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
like the exclusion of any children's
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
rights is going to elevate parental
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
rights over that of children and i find
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
that so sad and so problematic okay
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
senator carson
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mr chair um
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
i think we have debated this issue
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
at length
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
during the
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
house hearing during the senate hearing
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
on the senate floor
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
we can't i i just can't see
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
to keep debating this issue over and
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
over and over again and i think it's
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
time for
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
for us to make a decision
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
uh you know i think you're correct and i
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh allowed a little bit of latitude here
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
since there are fresh faces behind the
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
table today
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
and uh i think uh we've had enough at
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
this point uh how does the house uh feel
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
about this amendment are we are we good
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
it can come
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so the house uh agrees with this
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
amendment okay
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
are there any further amendments to
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
discuss today
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
i do have an amendment i would like to
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
bring forward
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
guess we will entertain that thank you
 
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.470 align:start position:0%
guess we will entertain that thank you
um

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
so there is an amendment here
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
this is something that we had this is
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
not new this is something we have
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
discussed you'll see that the amendment
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
has two separate parts um everyone
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
should have in front of them the first
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
one is in recognition of the important
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
parental rights
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we have already in state law and i
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
think that's an important thing to note
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
parents already have
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
very clear constitutional rights
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
statutory rights and other rights
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
defined elsewhere and so this uh
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
amendment requires the department of
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
health and human services the department
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
of education to collate all those rights
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
into one places which is my
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
understanding the why people wanted this
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
bill in the first place collate all
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
these rights in one place and make that
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
available to the public plain and simple
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
the second part of the amendment creates
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
a commission
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
to study the parental rights you'll see
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
that it has broad membership including
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
parents and administrators and child
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
advocates it's a more balanced approach
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
because we are all not only thinking
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
about parents rights but we're thinking
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
about children's rights
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that all the duties uh on
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
of the commission
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
talk about exactly what is in the bill
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
all these things that people are
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
concerned with let's talk about it in a
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
thoughtful way
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
we have heard
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill from new futures
 
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.669 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill from new futures
from

00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%

people from so many parents i have
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
gotten hundreds and hundreds and
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of parents who are opposed to
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%

unintended consequences let's look at
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
this in a thoughtful way
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
in a thoughtful way and make sure we are
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
not harming children so i think this is
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
a very good step forward and i hope the
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
committee can support it
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%

for a number of months and i do believe
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
that uh all of us have uh received
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
hundreds or thousands of emails uh from
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%

the senate it died 12 to 12. so this
