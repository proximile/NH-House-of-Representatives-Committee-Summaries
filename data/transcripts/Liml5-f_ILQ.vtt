00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
everybody

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
that's mine yeah
 
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh I've I put together a little packet
 
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
which I would like to go through very
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
very quickly here seeing that we're
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
doing dealing with the issue of Co-op
 
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
school districts and everything
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
associated with assets a portion that of
 
00:08:56.769 --> 00:08:56.779 align:start position:0%
board members all that
 
00:08:59.329 --> 00:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that we take a
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
little walk through so everybody's on
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
has a pretty good understanding of what
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
we're addressing here this is not an
 
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
issue unique to this particular year
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
I've been in the education on the
 
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
education committee for the last 14
 
00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
years and I can't remember a year in
 
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
which we didn't discuss co-ops
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
um it's one of those topics that just uh
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
is very difficult because it had it it
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
it it entails talking about every aspect
 
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
of the state in terms of our demographic
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
our population and our organizational
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
structure so if you're if you have a
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
copy of this I'd like to Wade through it
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
first for
 
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
folks um
 
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
the way this thing came out I'll just
 
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
take the order of the sheets that are
 
00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:44.030 align:start position:0%
take the order of the sheets that are
there

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
um a co-op district is one which has
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
various school districts within it that
 
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
are are part of that Cooperative
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
agreement and it's an agreement which uh
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
you write amongst those people that are
 
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
coming to get districts coming together
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
and it's like a marriage
 
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
and if anybody's been through a divorce
 
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
fortunately I've never had that uh not
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity that decision to make but uh
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's difficult and it carries
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
with it so many issues and so many
 
00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:14.389 align:start position:0%
with it so many issues and so many
strings

00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
strings
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
so the the first one shows you that
 
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
um uh in terms of the Randolph Gorham
 
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
Shelburne uh Co-op District issue and
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
then of course Merrimack Valley
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
Timberlane and conocook it showed us the
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
census when it was done uh did the
 
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
population acid that 2020 and the
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
percentage of the population that comes
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
from each particular community and the
 
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
seats whether they be a seat at large or
 
00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:44.459 align:start position:0%
a seat That's Unique just uniquely to
 
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
that particular District
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
there are a number of Co-op districts if
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
you go to the sheet two there
 
00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:52.019 align:start position:0%
apportionment formulas for Cooperative
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
disc school districts for your
 
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
information we have
 
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
over that's 30 plus Co-op districts in
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
the state and if you look at the number
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
of towns or school districts that that
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
involves it involves close to 120
 
00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019 align:start position:0%
districts within this state that's a
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
high number of the districts and so what
 
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
we're talking about we're talking about
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
issues here in these three bills which
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
impact from north to south and east to
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
west in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
so you go through and see all those
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
particular districts I for one live in a
 
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
district which is a co-op District
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
and within that district there are seven
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
at large members of which they all come
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
from the same community
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's because we had one Village District
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
that initially had their own school
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
since closed down and Woodsville is not
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
part of Haverhill so it's a Haverhill
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
co-op with just seven at-large members
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
they're all at large because one area
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
Town never
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
put anybody on the dock and to be voted
 
00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
for so they all were coming initially
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
from North Haverhill and Woodsville
 
00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:03.019 align:start position:0%
Haverhill Corner didn't care
 
00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:04.550 align:start position:0%
Haverhill Corner didn't care
so

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the the way they get together
 
00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
there's articles of agreement and you
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
can see on the down in the next uh Below
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
in the packet there shows all the co-ops
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's an article of agreement we just
 
00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:20.579 align:start position:0%
took that one District of the first pile
 
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
last year and years before we've looked
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
at this issue even when we had
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative Grenier in charge of a
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
committee a commission to look at this
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
we gathered many many articles of
 
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
agreement together this was just the
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
first one on top of the Heap I took it
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
and ran it off today so you can see that
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
there are articles which tells you how
 
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
members are apportions with to those
 
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
districts and how often the Agreements
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
are looked at to review or update be it
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
10 years or five years and there's a lot
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
to it usually you'll see seven uh 9 11
 
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
13 15 up to 15 members that can be on a
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
uh going through this further here
 
00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:07.610 align:start position:0%
uh going through this further here
um

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
and we've had some samples there of how
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
seats might be proportioned if you'd use
 
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
the one man one vote type
 
00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:17.959 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
principle and lastly there is a sheet
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
there which shows we struggled with
 
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
apportionment last year and we did come
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
up with a Amendment which did not fly
 
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
the the bill was at the I think was the
 
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
Litchfield Bill and and that bill it we
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
it's not one we're discussing today
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
that's one that did have a lot more
 
00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:43.019 align:start position:0%
energy given to it by the whole folks
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
here because you know we were looking at
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
one person one vote and in the smaller
 
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
districts sometimes are the ones which
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't have that they have to combine
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
with another one so with that
 
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
that's information available to you I'd
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
like to now just uh open this up to
 
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
where we have to be today the purpose of
 
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
the interim study is to recommend that
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
we either move forward with the these
 
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.509 align:start position:0%
we either move forward with the these
bills

00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
with legislation in the upcoming session
 
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
not necessarily these bills per se but
 
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
language which addresses some of the
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
what you see in the analysis of those
 
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.550 align:start position:0%
what you see in the analysis of those
bills

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
go forward whether it make
 
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
recommendations go forward perhaps with
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
recommendations or if we make the
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
decision we're not going to move the
 
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
bill forward we're not going to move
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
that concept forward we're going to
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
leave it alone
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
so those are the only two options which
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
we really have and on the interim study
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
we're not here to design new legislation
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
we can you know that's done individually
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
or by the group later on when we put in
 
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
and and put legislation in we've already
 
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
gone through one filing period which
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
opened up on September 6 and closed on
 
00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
September 16th for those that are in the
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
house right now there will be another
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
filing period after the election and
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
that uh it will be when you'll see
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
anything if anything does come forward
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh regarding this so with that I'd like
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
to open this up and is there any further
 
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
discussion right now on these bills we
 
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.310 align:start position:0%
discussion right now on these bills we
have

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.689 align:start position:0%
have
1366

00:15:16.689 --> 00:15:16.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
13.99 and 1679
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
1366 is relative to school board
 
00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:27.769 align:start position:0%
1366 is relative to school board
reapportionment

00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
1399 is relative School District
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from a school district
 
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of energy being put on
 
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
that and 1679 was came from my friend to
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
my right ear left representative
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
cordelli and we've gone through this for
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
a number of years and his concept was
 
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:50.459 align:start position:0%
let's just dissolve it all and start all
 
00:15:52.329 --> 00:15:52.339 align:start position:0%
over again
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
that was so that's a relative to the
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
dissolution and repeal The Cooperative
 
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh we've gone through consolidation
 
00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
schools over in the state of Maine and
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
as I recall when I was an administrator
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
over there we ended up consolidating one
 
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:09.959 align:start position:0%
school district Rumford Mexico and they
 
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
were going to do that anyways seeing
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
they're right on the Androscoggin river
 
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
there and there really are one Community
 
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
Vermont's also gone through an act over
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
there of which for my talking with as
 
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
superintendent was over there who's now
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
came back and left that state back in
 
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire here has now since retired
 
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
he indicated to me that the
 
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
administrative costs for their act are
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
higher now than they were before uh it's
 
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:41.540 align:start position:0%
it's so consolidation has some Financial
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
issues associated with it so
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
with that uh we're open the committee's
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
open now to discussion on any of the
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
three bills or or on the issue of
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
Cooperative schools representative
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
Mullen thank you Mr chair
 
00:16:59.930 --> 00:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
um would you could you remind me whether
 
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:03.860 align:start position:0%
or not these bills came from
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
requests by Cooperative school districts
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
to change the membership or change the
 
00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:13.579 align:start position:0%
the uh affiliation
 
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
the first two bills that we had in order
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
of numbering uh basically a result of uh
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
a district feeling that they didn't have
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
the the representative of that that
 
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
District was voted upon at large and and
 
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh the and I'm just trying to recall
 
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
with my memory too that the the person
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
did not was not domiciled in that
 
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
particular community and elected by the
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
people in that particular District they
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
were elected at large so the districts
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
of the greater population were were you
 
00:17:54.169 --> 00:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
know deciding members on the board on
 
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
the co-op board I I believe that I may
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
be wrong uh reps and cordelli is that
 
00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:01.010 align:start position:0%
be wrong uh reps and cordelli is that
you're

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
I believe that's generally the case yeah
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
and they were presented by by one
 
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
representative representative uh Power
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
was uh the one that right and just as a
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
follow-up comment I was asking because I
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
know the representative power is uh from
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
Merrimack which district is she from
 
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
Merrimack is it Merrimack
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
oh Hollis Brooklyn All right so she is
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
from a Cooperative District okay yeah
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this okay I'll
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
open this up to the public too
 
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
um if uh if there is a an individual
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
here or a group that would like to speak
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
in regard to a concern dealing with a
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts or to offer
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
us some input and
 
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
how to make a decision here we'd welcome
 
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
that at this time
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay our New Hampshire school boards
 
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
good morning do you have your mic on
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
there you go good morning thank you
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd good morning members of
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
the committee bear Christina from the
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school boards Association
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
I bet you're all surprised to see me
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
here when we're talking about these
 
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.450 align:start position:0%
here when we're talking about these
bills

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
um just to um once again reiterate as I
 
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:23.990 align:start position:0%
um just to um once again reiterate as I
mentioned

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
um a handful of times last year nhsba's
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
position would be that the legislature
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
adopt a two-year-long study commission
 
00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:33.539 align:start position:0%
so we can do this properly we can bring
 
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
in the dra we can bring in the Secretary
 
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
of State's office or AG to talk about
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
the one-man one vote we can bring in
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
school board members from Cooperative
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
School District superintendents from
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts into a very
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive review of RSA 195 in its
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
totality these sort of Patchwork
 
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.830 align:start position:0%
totality these sort of Patchwork
approaches

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
approaches
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion an nhsbe's opinion do
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
not fit for the complexities of the 32
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
co-ops in in this state
 
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
um so that would be nhsba's
 
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.270 align:start position:0%
um so that would be nhsba's
recommendation

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
hmm thank you would you give maybe the
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
committee a brief overview for example
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
if I'm a district and I want out
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
the about the feasibility study the
 
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
sustainability of it and then how the
 
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
State Board interacts with the local
 
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
board sure I can talk about that a
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
little bit um I I do know that there we
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
do have an attorney in the audience who
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
has worked with school districts related
 
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
going through withdrawal processing so
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
he probably has better specific
 
00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:33.539 align:start position:0%
information and knowledge than I would
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
um but essentially a warrant article can
 
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
be placed on a school district warrant
 
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
to study withdrawal or or to study the
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
makeup of your portion formula or to
 
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
review your articles of agreement you
 
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
can do that at any time there is another
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
odd twist in the co-op statute where
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
um on the town warrant at the Town
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
annual meeting that one of the towns
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
that is part of the co-op can
 
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
um have on the town warrant a a a
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
petition warrant article to study
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
withdrawal if that passes then the
 
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
school board of the co-op district is
 
00:21:14.409 --> 00:21:14.419 align:start position:0%
obligated to initiate a withdrawal study
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
the statutes relative to dissolution of
 
00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
of property are are confusing and I
 
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
don't have the best handle on those to
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
be quite honest with you I was in our
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
office uh yesterday with our staff
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
attorney trying to assist one community
 
00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:30.419 align:start position:0%
that is in the middle of a withdrawal
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
process and we read the statute six
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
different ways and came up with a
 
00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
different conclusion six different times
 
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.890 align:start position:0%
different conclusion six different times
so

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
um but essentially there's a study a
 
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
um uh made up of a couple people from
 
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
each of the towns I believe the
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
superintendent is an ex-officio member
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
of that committee
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
um and I think you can add people to the
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee sometimes I've seen select
 
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
board members or various constituents
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
from either of the communities and they
 
00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:57.059 align:start position:0%
run through the numbers they talk about
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
how much it would cost they talk about
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
if there are if there's any outstanding
 
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
indebtedness if there's a for example a
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
bond on on a building and what person
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
may have to or what community may have
 
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
to sort of pay pay back a portion of
 
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
that Bond there's discussions about this
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
of about
 
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
um uh not just real property but
 
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
personal property desks and computers
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
and what's going to happen with the
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
teachers and things of that nature so
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
the committee then uh it comes up with a
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawal plan either excuse me they
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation to either yes
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
person withdrawal or not pursue
 
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:33.419 align:start position:0%
withdrawal at that point
 
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:36.539 align:start position:0%
um the the the the the plan if you will
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
or the findings go to the State Board
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
there is a provision law that allows for
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
Minority Report to go to the State Board
 
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
we added that in the law about five
 
00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
um so it's a lot more complex than that
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
but I mean I I also don't want to sit
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
here for an hour explaining every Nuance
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
of of RSA 195 and with withdrawal
 
00:22:59.810 --> 00:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
statutes so if the State Board accepts
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal plan or denies that that
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
what's the next step back it goes back
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
to the vote it goes back to the voters
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the uh interesting things is I
 
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
have to double check I believe the vote
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
to withdraw is Co-op wide though it's
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
not just the community it's not just the
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
one town within the co-op that's looking
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
to to uh to withdraw and I guess the
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
rationale for that was when the co-op
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
was formed it took a vote of all the
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
communities to form the co-op so I guess
 
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
um you know it takes takes two parties
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
to get married and in this case I guess
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
it takes two parties to get divorced too
 
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
and you can't just run off and the town
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
can't just file for divorce on on its
 
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.610 align:start position:0%
can't just file for divorce on on its
own

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
um I know that that was been an issue in
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
some communities as well too but
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
essentially the State Board would either
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
approve or disapprove the proposal and
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
then it goes back to the voters of the
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
co-op Co-op wide and they ultimately
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
vote on whether or not that town can or
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
should withdraw thank you that's just my
 
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
understanding too yes representative
 
00:24:00.419 --> 00:24:02.149 align:start position:0%
understanding too yes representative
Luna

00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
Luna
 
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr Christina in um in 195
 
00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:09.409 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr Christina in um in 195
18

00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:09.419 align:start position:0%
18
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
um uh which has uh well 195 has a number
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
of sections in it 18 I think talked
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
specifically about
 
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
um uh Cooperative school districts and
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
IT addresses the um the art the what
 
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
what has to be in the um the art the
 
00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:33.380 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement and uh and
 
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
one of the things it talks about is
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
dissolution but does it also I guess is
 
00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:42.539 align:start position:0%
is withdrawal the same or or different
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
is it the same or different than
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
dissolution and have you do do
 
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:48.890 align:start position:0%
dissolution and have you do do
um

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
does the does the statute provide any
 
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.390 align:start position:0%
does the does the statute provide any
um

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
I guess standards for for for what needs
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
to be considered in um in an article of
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
withdrawal or an article
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
um for dissolution thank you for the
 
00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:08.750 align:start position:0%
um for dissolution thank you for the
question

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.310 align:start position:0%
question
um representative

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
um I believe withdrawal and dissolution
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
are are different things dissolution
 
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
means that the co-op is no longer
 
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
existing as a corporate legal entity for
 
00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
example a number of years ago the Goshen
 
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
lemster School Cooperative School
 
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
District dissolved so you had two single
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
districts then you had Goshen and
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
lemster there's no more Cooperative
 
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
that's a dissolution alternatively if
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
you had a three-town co-op in one town
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
with Drew the two remaining towns would
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
not have dissolved it would have been
 
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
amended if you will
 
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
um so so yes there's a difference
 
00:25:45.289 --> 00:25:45.299 align:start position:0%
between a withdrawal and a dissolution
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
dissolution the the co-op no longer
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
exists as a legal entity withdrawal you
 
00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539 align:start position:0%
might have one Community withdraw from a
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
four or five Town Co-op the remaining
 
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
town still exists as as the co-op and I
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
for forget what the second part of your
 
00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
question was representative something
 
00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:01.799 align:start position:0%
about right right so so um
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'll actually turn it into a
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up go ahead Rick
 
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.190 align:start position:0%
follow-up go ahead Rick
um

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
so so in in in the in the
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
in the Statue 195 18 uh where the state
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
does require agreements to to have um
 
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
yep to have uh uh a provision for this
 
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.490 align:start position:0%
yep to have uh uh a provision for this
dissolution

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
dissolution
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
um does the state also require provision
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
in the Articles of agreement for
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
withdrawal and then the um the really
 
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
the the question is does the state does
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
the statute get into any details in
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
terms of in terms of what is permitted
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
um in the Articles of agreement right in
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
in any of these
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
um different areas or is it really left
 
00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
up to the uh the the co-op in the city
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
sure one of one of the problems
 
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
um with the statute as currently written
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
is that it oftentimes
 
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
um uses different words but there seems
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
to be an implication that they're
 
00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
intended to mean the same thing so under
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
195 RSA 195 18 procedure for formation
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
of a Cooperative school district and
 
00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:16.100 align:start position:0%
this is down in subparagraph k
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
for Cooperative school districts formed
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
after the date of this subparagraph
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
which I believe is probably 1963 a plan
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
for dissolution of the co-op so you're
 
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're you're you're
 
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
you're you're forming documents your
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
your articles of agreement have to have
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
a plan for dissolution but there's
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
nothing in there that talks about a plan
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
upon withdrawal of one of the members in
 
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
terms of what has to go into the
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
withdrawal plan that is RSA 195 colon
 
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
26. what's interesting about that I was
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
just talking about this with our with
 
00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
our statute or our staff attorney
 
00:27:51.659 --> 00:27:53.510 align:start position:0%
our statute or our staff attorney
yesterday

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
um there's a conflict between 195 26 and
 
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.570 align:start position:0%
um there's a conflict between 195 26 and
195.28

00:27:59.570 --> 00:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
195.28
 
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.250 align:start position:0%
195.28
um

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:00.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
uh uh I'm trying to find where that
 
00:28:06.409 --> 00:28:06.419 align:start position:0%
where that was
 
00:28:06.419 --> 00:28:09.110 align:start position:0%
where that was
um

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
so for example uh
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm in 195 28 if you have in front of
 
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.269 align:start position:0%
so I'm in 195 28 if you have in front of
you

00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
the last the second to last sentence the
 
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
amount of said Capital Improvements and
 
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
additions at the time of the transfer
 
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
title shall be determined by the
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
agreement for withdr for withdrawal
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
between the Cooperative school district
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
and the withdrawn School District so
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
agreement for withdrawal there's no
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
agreement for withdrawal that's
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
generally that's described as a
 
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
withdrawal plan in the earlier statutes
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
but the other interesting aspect about
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
that where it says the amount of said
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements and additions and
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
the time of transfer title if you go
 
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
back up to 195.26
 
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
I don't think it talks about
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily talk about the
 
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.990 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily talk about the
Capital

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
Capital
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
Improvements and additions there's some
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
language in there about outstanding
 
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
indebtedness so there's some conflict
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
between 195 28 and 195 26 about what
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
needs to be within the plan I will say
 
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
that the withdrawal plans are using much
 
00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:12.419 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive than what than what
 
00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:17.299 align:start position:0%
195 26 requires that's my sort of
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
anecdotal knowledge if you will
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
so do do all do all um articles of
 
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.029 align:start position:0%
so do do all do all um articles of
agreement

00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
have to include a withdrawal plan not a
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
withdrawal plan but
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
um if we go back up to 195.18
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
the articles of agreement are supposed
 
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
to include
 
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
so we see you know we've paragraph three
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
of 195.28 says the Cooperative School
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
District planning board May recommend
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
that a Cooperative School District
 
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
composed of all the districts
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
represented by his membership so on and
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
so forth the planning board self-repair
 
00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:57.299 align:start position:0%
proposed articles of agreement for the
 
00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
proposed Cooperative School District
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
which shall be signed by a majority of
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
the planning board which shall set forth
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
the following and then it will sell
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph a through l or k or whatever
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
it is and then K talks about the
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
dissolution so the articles of agreement
 
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
have to have a provision about what
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
happens upon dissolution of the co-op
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
but the articles of agreement the
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
forming the formational documents don't
 
00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
have to have anything in there about
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
withdrawal of the agreement
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chair obviously when
 
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh co-ops have formed there was some
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
sense of consensus on need and common
 
00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:39.470 align:start position:0%
sense of consensus on need and common
interest

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.490 align:start position:0%
interest
Etc

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
and over the years
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
those interests may change
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
politics may change numbers may change
 
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
so when a um
 
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
dissolution or a withdrawal takes place
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
I want to focus on the withdrawal issue
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
and you have
 
00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:03.059 align:start position:0%
a new school district basically created
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
as a result of the withdrawal
 
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
my question deals with the fiscal nature
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
that obviously when you have a co-op
 
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a sharing of costs
 
00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419 align:start position:0%
from the various School various
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
communities Etc
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
but when that withdrawal takes place
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
that community that withdraws Bears the
 
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
burden of the fiscal nature of running a
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
so my question has to deal with the
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
increased cost
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
that may come to a community or a lot or
 
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
a decrease in cost perhaps what's been
 
00:31:39.289 --> 00:31:39.299 align:start position:0%
your experience as it relates to the
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
impact on the citizens and the students
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
in that withdrawal as it relates to the
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal cost of the withdrawal sure thank
 
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
you very much for the for the question
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative um I'll be quite honest
 
00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
with you I don't know if I have any
 
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
direct knowledge as to what sort of the
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
resulting fiscal or educational impact
 
00:31:59.090 --> 00:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
has been in the town that that is
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
withdrawn I'm trying to think of I mean
 
00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419 align:start position:0%
there haven't been too many towns that
 
00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:06.299 align:start position:0%
have withdrawn from co-ops in the last
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
15 years maybe a couple Statewide
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
messinic kind of blew up a number of
 
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
um you know there have been there have
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
been efforts I know there were some
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
issues in Timberlane there's an issue
 
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
with Carol going on right now
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
um you know my experience again
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
anecdotally and just remember some of
 
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
the people that we brought in with the
 
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
study commission five or six years ago
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
whenever that was chairman Ladd
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the complaints seem to do
 
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
with um sort of the apportionment
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
Formula One Town feeling that they were
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
paying too much
 
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
um you know or one town feeling that
 
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
they were paying too much and not
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
necessarily getting the services back
 
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
for their kids and perhaps their little
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
Elementary School
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
um you know and and so I don't have any
 
00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:54.419 align:start position:0%
direct experiences to the the fiscal
 
00:32:54.419 --> 00:32:55.789 align:start position:0%
direct experiences to the the fiscal
impact

00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
um I will say though it probably you
 
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
know if if a community withdraws from a
 
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
from a co-op and they simply turn around
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
and tuition their kids back to the same
 
00:33:09.649 --> 00:33:09.659 align:start position:0%
high school that they were going
 
00:33:09.659 --> 00:33:10.310 align:start position:0%
high school that they were going
um

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
you know I don't I I don't know if that
 
00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
flat tuition cost
 
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
is is the true cost of what's causing to
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
educate those kids in that building so
 
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
it seems like the remaining towns in the
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
co-op May then be footing some of the
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
bill Capital costs things of that nature
 
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
for those kids that are coming back in
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
that were already there to begin with
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh follow up please follow up one of the
 
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
issues that
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
has come before us
 
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's been Hollis Brookline
 
00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
Hollis Brookline has come before this
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee several times as far as in
 
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.950 align:start position:0%
committee several times as far as in
conversations

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
and the Dynamics that have changed
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
between both Hollis and Brookline with
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
where the high school is located
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis where there's been a growth in
 
00:33:57.529 --> 00:33:57.539 align:start position:0%
the other community right how does uh
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
how does the co-op deal with that when
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
you've got when you have that kind of uh
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that kind of conflict that
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
begins with this so thank you very much
 
00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:08.099 align:start position:0%
for the question representative what
 
00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:09.169 align:start position:0%
for the question representative what
often

00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
often
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
I think is not mentioned in this
 
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
committee and maybe I should do a better
 
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
job of bringing it up is there are
 
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
Provisions in law that allow you to
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
amend your articles of agreement without
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
withdrawing you can you can remember
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
your articles of agreement at any time
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
it takes planning and it takes some work
 
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
and you have to have a a study committee
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
and look at the numbers and bring in the
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
dra numbers and your business you know
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
your business manager to run the
 
00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:35.339 align:start position:0%
apportion formulas
 
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
um you know and there's also you know
 
00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:40.460 align:start position:0%
you can the law allows communities
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
co-ops to change the apportionment
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
formula from either you know property
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
value or students or some combination
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
thereof you know number of heads versus
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
what the the property values are in the
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
community and you can do anything from
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
zero percent to one hundred percent on
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
any of those so
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
um you know you can we talked about this
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
last session there are Provisions to
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
change the way that the Cooperative
 
00:35:07.849 --> 00:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
school board members are elected those
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
are already allowed in law
 
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
how many districts are going through
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
sort of changes or planning changes to
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
to amend the current and you know keep
 
00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
the status quo with the communities but
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
yet change what I I have no idea I don't
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
um I will tell you that you know nhsba
 
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
let's say the last three or four years
 
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
maybe even a little bit longer because I
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
don't know how much of this was going on
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
during the during the pandemic
 
00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
um you know we we work with some
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
Consultants um where a a board will call
 
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
us and say we think we want to withdraw
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
or we think we want to study withdrawal
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
but we're not sure we're there yet can
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
you send somebody down and help us do
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
some pre-work if you will before we get
 
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
down the road of doing the statutory
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
study commission and whatnot and so you
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
know I've got some consultants usually
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
former business managers or former
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
superintendents that have been in co-ops
 
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
that understand sort of the nature of of
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
what a co-op is
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
and they'll go down and they'll do six
 
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
months worth of work and they say you
 
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
know what it may not be perfect but it's
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
better than the alternative we see that
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
quite a bit as well too
 
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you Mr chairman
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
um getting back to the point about uh
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
dissolution plans in the Articles of
 
00:36:26.339 --> 00:36:27.470 align:start position:0%
dissolution plans in the Articles of
agreement

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:29.300 align:start position:0%
um I think that that
 
00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:32.099 align:start position:0%
subparagraph came into effect only as a
 
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
result of the uh 1997 study
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
um that you referred to earlier and that
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
actually no Co-op has been formed since
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
that point so in effect no articles of
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
agreement are required to have
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
um an article related to dissolution
 
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
would you say that is correct yeah thank
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
you very much representative Cordell if
 
00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
that provision paragraph K I believe it
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
is is a you know relatively newer
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
provision within the last what 15 20
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
years or so that would that would make
 
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
sense then that that the and since we
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
haven't I think there's been one Co-op
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
that's been formed in the last
 
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
15 20 years but it was sort of an
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
expansion Wilton wine Borough they were
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
a co-op for I believe the middle school
 
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
and high school and there was a Wilton
 
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
Elementary School in a lineborough
 
00:37:23.569 --> 00:37:23.579 align:start position:0%
elementary school I want to say maybe 10
 
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
12 years ago they just made the whole
 
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
thing K-12 so it really wasn't A
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
disruption or a new town coming into
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
anything same SAU same teacher same
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
staff same superintendent but yeah if
 
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
that's a newer provision that would make
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
sense because we haven't had any like
 
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
brand new co-ops informed in decades
 
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
right follow-up thank you
 
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
um I I think in the discussion of
 
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.510 align:start position:0%
um I I think in the discussion of
withdrawals

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
withdrawals
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
um that has been the most common
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
um legislation that we've seen over the
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
past well 10 years that I've been here
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of bills that have been filed
 
00:37:57.839 --> 00:37:58.790 align:start position:0%
in terms of bills that have been filed
that's

00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
um certainly they all or the majority of
 
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
them deal with the withdrawal process
 
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.750 align:start position:0%
them deal with the withdrawal process
and

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
um 13.99 is example of that right I
 
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
think one of the problems
 
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
um I think you said there was only a
 
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
couple of withdrawals that have occurred
 
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
a single
 
00:38:20.329 --> 00:38:20.339 align:start position:0%
school from the from the cooperative and
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
I think one of the reasons for that is
 
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.210 align:start position:0%
I think one of the reasons for that is
that

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
um in most cases
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
um the larger District within the co-op
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
if it's a district-wide co-op
 
00:38:34.849 --> 00:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
district-wide vote a small town that
 
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
might want to withdraw has virtually no
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
chance to get passage of uh their
 
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.410 align:start position:0%
chance to get passage of uh their
withdrawal

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:44.420 align:start position:0%
withdrawal
 
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
so I think that that's an inherent
 
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:51.740 align:start position:0%
problem that we have with the current
 
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
laws sure
 
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.609 align:start position:0%
laws sure
good

00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
not really a question but I would
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
welcome your comments sure thank you
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
very much representative
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
um I I yeah we've certainly heard that
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
that the the large community carries
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
carries the vote
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
um I will say um just trying to think of
 
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
a couple of the communities that I know
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
have withdrawn
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
just at least in my tenure at nhsba
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
which gets longer and longer every year
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
um uh Surrey and Sullivan both withdrew
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
from I believe that was the Monadnock
 
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
Regional that was maybe 15 years ago
 
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
very small communities
 
00:39:29.329 --> 00:39:29.339 align:start position:0%
um Mason withdrew from
 
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:32.780 align:start position:0%
um uh messenic maybe
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
2007 8 9-ish
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know how and that's
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
Greenville and New Ipswich and I forget
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
if there's another community in Miss
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
Scenic and I don't know the how how big
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
Mason is compared to all those others so
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
um I I understand that we hear that and
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
I understand that that may be a concern
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
in some communities but there are other
 
00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
examples of very small communities being
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
able to withdraw from from a co-op
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh Barrett do you have any uh districts
 
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
contacting you and saying Okay
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
um we would want to look at our articles
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
of agreement there's yeah all these 32
 
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
different co-ops of which all those
 
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
articles are different yeah and that's
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
part of our quandary too how do we deal
 
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
with this we we
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
um we don't we have not been asked to
 
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
review them for the sake of a review we
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
from time to time and not very common
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
I've been asked to look at them just to
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
see if if if if the articles of
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
agreement support something that they're
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
trying to do whether some sort of
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
Warrant article or some sort of change
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
in something like that
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
um but I mean just asking us to do a
 
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
review of their articles of agreement to
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
see if what could be changed I haven't
 
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
been asked to do that I've made the
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
private attorneys may have but we
 
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
haven't so my question is last year we
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
had some language which was in one of
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
our amendments and it read
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
reapportionment of members of The
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School Board shall be
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
reviewed revised and updated no less
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
frequently than every 10 years and
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
reapportions if necessary based upon the
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
latest Federal DC Centennial census
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
right so every 10 years is this
 
00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:13.430 align:start position:0%
right so every 10 years is this
currently

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
occurring our our co-ops looking at
 
00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
their articles of agreement and trying
 
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
to amend them to stay current with law
 
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:26.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I think I think
 
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
I think they're certainly reviewing them
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
just because this is be you know we're
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
hearing more and more
 
00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:35.579 align:start position:0%
um of this as representative cordelli
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
said we get a lot of bills the last 10
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
years or so so I think people are
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
reviewing them
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
um but when I say reviewing them I don't
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
know if that's happening in any sort of
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
formal sense through a committee or
 
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
process or anything I think the board
 
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
members are looking at them the
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
superintendents are looking at them so
 
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
on and so forth in terms of the the the
 
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
the the the every 10 years or whatnot I
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
mean again yeah that might be a best
 
00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.970 align:start position:0%
mean again yeah that might be a best
practice

00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
um if that were to make it into law you
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
know it would at least put people it
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
would at least get people being aware of
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
their articles of agreement and how
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
things might need to change
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
um but again sort of the larger question
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
about legislation is you know is again
 
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
to reiterate I would prefer to see a big
 
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
study commission where all these
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
questions can be answered and we can
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
have experts come in and and hopefully
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
get some sort of clarification with the
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
Statue and the last question on this
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
topic now let down
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
um in in your knowledge what's going on
 
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
in the state from the school board
 
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:32.750 align:start position:0%
in the state from the school board
perspective

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.950 align:start position:0%
perspective
um

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
are are this
 
00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.730 align:start position:0%
are are this
um

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:41.099 align:start position:0%
are there a majority or very few that
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
are really having problems with their
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
Cooperative organization uh the school
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
district are are we dealing with an
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
issue that is Statewide or are we
 
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
dealing with a few districts yeah thank
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.569 align:start position:0%
you very much
um

00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:56.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
I'd say somewhere in between
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
um you know 10 years ago I think it was
 
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
a district here district there today
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's certainly more District towns
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
looking at least looking at studying
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
withdrawal not necessarily me saying
 
00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:11.579 align:start position:0%
they want to withdraw but I think maybe
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
that gets back to your point is maybe we
 
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
should be reviewing these articles of
 
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
agreement every 10 years
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
um you know have something set so you
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
know doing the review process
 
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
in for perhaps somewhat informally
 
00:43:25.849 --> 00:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
before we get into a formal withdrawal
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
process because sometimes the train
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
starts going and it's hard to hard to
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
stop that train
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
um so you know I I don't think it's
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily A A Statewide issue I think
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
we've certainly heard concerns from a
 
00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:41.099 align:start position:0%
community here or Community there but
 
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
then again I guess that brings me back
 
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
to the point that the current law
 
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
already allows us to make amendments to
 
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
all these sorts of things too the way
 
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
your your board members are elected the
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement the apportionment
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
formulas whether or not you're using
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
property values or or per student counts
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of flexibility in there
 
00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
and you know so
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
I think it's not as much as it was 10 I
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
think it's more than it was 10 years ago
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's still a lot that
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's a Statewide issue are there any
 
00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
00:44:11.819 --> 00:44:12.770 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
Tanner

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
Tanner
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.890 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
um I came into the state as a teacher
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
right when all this was happening in in
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
the late 60s and I was wondering if you
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
could speak to how at that point the the
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and also the
 
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
state as a whole was encouraging these
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
co-ops and why and as compared to today
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
how the state and the New Hampshire
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is supporting
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
the co-ops sure thank you very much for
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
the question representative I mean I you
 
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.109 align:start position:0%
the question representative I mean I you
know

00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
it may come to a surprise but I was not
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
alive in 1963 when these were when these
 
00:44:56.809 --> 00:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
were uh uh being formulated
 
00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:58.870 align:start position:0%
were uh uh being formulated
um

00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
I had a lot less gray hair before I
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
started coming down here every day
 
00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
though I'll tell you that
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
um uh I bet I bet the two of you did as
 
00:45:07.849 --> 00:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
well too
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
um but um so again my understanding just
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
doing some research of this throughout
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
the course of the year so that the the
 
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
co-op statute as we know it now was
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
primarily written in 1963.
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
um you know the you know and I got New
 
00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is probably a much
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
significantly different place today than
 
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
it was in 1963.
 
00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
um but it was it the purpose of it was
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
basically to create Regional High
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
Schools Cooperative high schools and
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
perhaps some middle schools where each
 
00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:35.339 align:start position:0%
town would kind of retain its little
 
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
elementary school but it didn't make
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
sense you know from a fiscal standpoint
 
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
for every community of a thousand people
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
to have their own Middle School and High
 
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
School building so you know so they
 
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
reached analyzed to save costs
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
administrative costs building costs so
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
on and so forth you know if you had the
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
high school in your town fantastic if
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
you had to drive 30 40 minutes over the
 
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.140 align:start position:0%
mountains well I'm too you know too bad
 
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
um but the the the the the if you look
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
at if you look at the co-op map the map
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
of all the co-ops and the towns that are
 
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
within those co-ops you're going to find
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
a mix of property rich and property poor
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
towns that was done on purpose that was
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
done on purpose to help share the costs
 
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
with a recognition that public education
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
was for the greater good so
 
00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:23.579 align:start position:0%
um you know what the Department's doing
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
now in terms of co-ops I don't I don't
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
know specifically I don't you know if if
 
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
people are calling the department
 
00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
attorneys relative to co-op issues I'm
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
not aware of that so I don't know
 
00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:36.260 align:start position:0%
um they call us from time to time again
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know we try and it's interesting
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
when a school board calls us relative to
 
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
a potential Co-op withdrawal because we
 
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
have to walk a very fine line because
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
our client Our member is the Co-op as it
 
00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
exists right now and I'm obligated to
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
not do anything or give any legal advice
 
00:46:55.609 --> 00:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
that may be contrary to the interest of
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
that of that Collective Co-op body
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
school board so we always tell boards
 
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
look we can help you with process right
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
timelines and this is who's got to be on
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
the committee and what the statute says
 
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
but we can't give any advice as to yes
 
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea or no this is a bad
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
idea we can't do that that's not that's
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
for the people in that Community to do
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
to to determine so NHS the the scope or
 
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
extent of nhsba's assistance when
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
districts are studying withdrawal is
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
more process driven we can tell them
 
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay this is what the statute says this
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
is what has to be in your plan this is
 
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
the timeline you know this is our best
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation of what this statute
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
means but you really need to call local
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
Council or have you know a private
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
attorney assist you with interpreting
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
all these things because it's not it's
 
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
not our place to do that
 
00:47:46.609 --> 00:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
I I know that uh the Department of
 
00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
Education is present here with their
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
attorney and perhaps we can hold that
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
question off as far as is the doe
 
00:47:59.690 --> 00:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
engaged in any Cooperative discussions
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
with various districts at this time
 
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
and I I believe they are
 
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.470 align:start position:0%
and I I believe they are
um

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
yes cordelli and thank you
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
um in terms of required review
 
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
um maybe your memory is better than mine
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
but I seem to recall that a required
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
review of the
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
um articles of agreement is only
 
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
required for co-ops that were formed
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
before 1963.
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
God sorry no I just wondering if you're
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
you have uh recollection
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much for the
 
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
question representative I'm just trying
 
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
to do a quick yeah research here I was
 
00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
too I don't I don't recall offhand
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
possibly I don't recall offhand though
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
um secondly if I could just
 
00:48:53.809 --> 00:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
um with uh Amendment of the Articles of
 
00:48:53.819 --> 00:48:55.490 align:start position:0%
um with uh Amendment of the Articles of
agreement

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
um is that also a district
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
Co-op wide vote so again
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
um a smaller District who wants a change
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
to the articles in terms of enforcement
 
00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
might have a difficult time yeah that
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
has to go on the warrant it's a warrant
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
article that would have to be voted on
 
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:17.339 align:start position:0%
Co-op wide among all the communities
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know there'd be a problem
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah further questions of the school yes
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I've been in several of these
 
00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
situations when sau13 split from sau9
 
00:49:32.089 --> 00:49:32.099 align:start position:0%
and also for governor wentworth's School
 
00:49:32.099 --> 00:49:33.170 align:start position:0%
and also for governor wentworth's School
District

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
in our town a little American Governor
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
Wentworth we're a small town 750 people
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
no businesses
 
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
we pay probably the highest taxes and
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's some people on this committee
 
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
that pay the lowest but that's neither
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
here nor there I won't look at represent
 
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.150 align:start position:0%
here nor there I won't look at represent
cordelli

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
um good for them but for us to have
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
withdrawn we have no school right and so
 
00:49:56.809 --> 00:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
we were up to Creek right there and we
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
when they uh Finance some of these
 
00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:02.420 align:start position:0%
buildings yeah there was like a 30 years
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
payment we had to pay out 25 years so it
 
00:50:07.849 --> 00:50:07.859 align:start position:0%
was absolutely pretty much impossible
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
for us to grow up financially yeah yeah
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
that's I've I've heard of that in other
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
communities as well too where just that
 
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a facility in your
 
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
community but yet there's still a bond
 
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
out on the high school you have to and
 
00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
you want to withdraw you have to pay
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
your fair share because you were part of
 
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
the co-op when they took that bond out
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
so you have to pay whatever your
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
proportional share would be to
 
00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:32.839 align:start position:0%
so kind of like alimony I guess you know
 
00:50:35.809 --> 00:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
so Barrett in conclusion here then from
 
00:50:37.609 --> 00:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
uh from the school boards Association
 
00:50:37.619 --> 00:50:38.930 align:start position:0%
uh from the school boards Association
perspective

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
um you've sort of advocated that this
 
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
might be addressed best through a
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
commission study another commission
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
study the last Grenier one that came up
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
with like 10 recommendations or ten
 
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
areas that he looked at was that a
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
committee or was that a commission that
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
was a commission it was a commission
 
00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
okay and uh so
 
00:50:57.059 --> 00:50:57.770 align:start position:0%
okay and uh so
um

00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
give me your ballpark your perspective
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
of what you think if if uh the latter
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
bill which we have which is
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli's bill here did
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
this dissolve the whole situation yeah
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
um and maybe go into the tuition program
 
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
um what would be the your your
 
00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
understanding of costs that we may be
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
looking at here and that is always a
 
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
concern to me is the financial cost the
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
state might be in in you know walking
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
down the path into you know if if you
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
were to just dissolve all the co-ops
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
today I mean my first question would be
 
00:51:40.849 --> 00:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
you the first thing you'd have to look
 
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
at from a cost standpoint anyway would
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
be how many of these co-ops have
 
00:51:47.089 --> 00:51:47.099 align:start position:0%
outstanding bonds and who's going to pay
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
right I mean is it still if we're just
 
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
dissolving Force dissolution then you
 
00:51:56.809 --> 00:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
know I know that that's a lengthy bill I
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
don't I didn't read it since last
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
session so there may have been a
 
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
provision in there about you know the
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
you still have to do other communities
 
00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:05.339 align:start position:0%
still have to pay their fair share of
 
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
the bonds or whatnot and the other thing
 
00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:10.460 align:start position:0%
too is you know
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
there may be concerns in a community
 
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
here or Community there and there may be
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
the situation as representative Nelson
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
and representative Cordell we talk about
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
where the small town can't get out
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
either because they don't have the votes
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
or it's not fiscally prudent you know
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean we need to blow up the
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
system seems to be like you'd be
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
throwing the baby out with the bath
 
00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.630 align:start position:0%
throwing the baby out with the bath
water

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:33.290 align:start position:0%
water
um

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know if if if the intent of that
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
bill was just to sort of leave some of
 
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we've talked about the
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
last whatever since I've been up here
 
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
half hour 45 minutes or whatever it's
 
00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:43.730 align:start position:0%
half hour 45 minutes or whatever it's
been

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
um you know I still come back that while
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
they may not be perfect there are
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
alternatives currently in law that allow
 
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
for changes that there may that may come
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
with some challenges as well too I won't
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
dispute that
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
um but you know
 
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
I think we need to you know all sort of
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
address those issues as well too if we
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
have a study commission so when we have
 
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
what do we have three five Co-op bills
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
every year we did the commission a
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
number of years ago and we get a couple
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
people here seems to be from generally
 
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
from some of the same communities and
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
the same people if we have a study
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
commission I mean the first thing that I
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
would do with that study commission is
 
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
we're not doing we're not talking about
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
legislation we're not talking about a
 
00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
portion of formula we're going to do two
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
two or three hour listening sessions if
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
you're in a co-op community and you have
 
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
a concern or complaint or you think
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
something's great and you have a model
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
that works come and talk to the
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
commission because that that's what
 
00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:38.339 align:start position:0%
we're going to want to hear that'll be
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
the first thing that I would do before
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
we even got into the dra and
 
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
apportionments and voting I'd hear I'd
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
want to hear from the people in the 32
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
co-ops about are you happy if not what's
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
the concern have you tried addressing it
 
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
locally have you gone through the the
 
00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:53.099 align:start position:0%
amendment process already in law and
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
then hear from other co-ops where things
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
are going well and they've come up with
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
Creative Solutions to help believe
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
deviate the concerns of of that town or
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
that community
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
well we may have a little bit of an
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to listen today to some that
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
may be coming from co-ops that are
 
00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
having you know that love it or are
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get out of it uh thank you
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
hey good morning Rick before we go on
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
would it be valuable for this group to
 
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
have a copy of that 97 the 1997 study
 
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:35.700 align:start position:0%
well yeah I think as much information
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
okay very great thank you Glenn thank
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
you welcome hi good morning my name is
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
Jim O'Shaughnessy I'm an attorney at
 
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
German Woodson it's a law firm in
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
Manchester as well as Maine and I
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
represent essentially exclusively school
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
districts and my firm represents a lot
 
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
of school districts in New Hampshire and
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
Maine and um
 
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
I think I was doing a rough estimate
 
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
um we work with about 18 Cooperative
 
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
school districts in the state I'm
 
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
general counsel for around 10 12 of
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
those school districts I've been
 
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
involved in a number of study
 
00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:14.870 align:start position:0%
involved in a number of study
commissions

00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:17.099 align:start position:0%
um specifically working with the
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
districts who are in the process of
 
00:55:22.329 --> 00:55:22.339 align:start position:0%
having having withdrawal study
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
conducted I've worked with also towns
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
who are has have hired me to advise them
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
on the potential for them to withdraw
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
from a Cooperative that was a couple of
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
years ago I think 2019 I worked with the
 
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
Charles uh Charlestown School the town
 
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
of Charlestown and their consideration
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
on withdrawing from Fall Mountain I've
 
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
testified a number of times that the
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
State Board I've been through a lot of
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
those meetings I've known a lot of
 
00:55:51.849 --> 00:55:51.859 align:start position:0%
school boards a lot of community members
 
00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
select board members so I have a fair I
 
00:55:57.370 --> 00:55:57.380 align:start position:0%
think a really robust
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
experience just in terms of what folks
 
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
in the state are talking about I was on
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
the 2017 study commission where we
 
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
studied the um the withdrawal process in
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
195 25 and 26 that came up with you know
 
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
the grenier's committee that came up
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
with some recommended language that
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
actually revised the withdrawal process
 
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
and kind of streamlined it and made it a
 
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
lot more clear we did some good work and
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
I'll just start by saying that study
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
commission was a was a we talked a lot
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
there was not a lot of expertise there
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
were a lot of people with interest but
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
there was not a lot of expertise on the
 
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
commission so we had a hard time sort of
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
streamlining and coming up with really
 
00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
good solutions to some of the problems
 
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
that just remained on the table and I
 
00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
can talk about you know where I think
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
there are issues that are are impacting
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
both the communities looking to withdraw
 
00:56:53.329 --> 00:56:53.339 align:start position:0%
and the Cooperative as a whole or the
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
communities that remain in a Cooperative
 
00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.630 align:start position:0%
communities that remain in a Cooperative
um

00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
I just want to uh I just want to clarify
 
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
a couple things
 
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
um there are really two types of there's
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
many types of cooperatives in New
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but there are really two types
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of how they were formed there
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
are cooperatives that were formed prior
 
00:57:13.609 --> 00:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
to 1963 and prior to the adoption of 195
 
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
18 and some of those cooperatives
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
predate the statute they were formed by
 
00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:20.339 align:start position:0%
a special Act of the legislature in the
 
00:57:22.849 --> 00:57:22.859 align:start position:0%
1950s and 60s the some of those
 
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
cooperatives don't in fact have articles
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
of agreement I represent a client that
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
does not actually have written articles
 
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
of agreement the articles of agreement
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
are essentially what the annual meeting
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
voters approve from time to time with
 
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
respect to the apportionment formula for
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
operating costs and capital costs so
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
there's the pre-1963 districts and
 
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
there's a post 1963 districts that are
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
subject to 195 18. how many excuse me
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
for putting in but how many are how many
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
pre no districts I knew at one point I
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
can't remember I there's not a there's
 
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
not a large number of 1963 districts but
 
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
there are some out there Monadnock is a
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
good example of a pre-1963 district and
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
I think if you go on the doe website
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
there are often dates of formation on
 
00:58:08.809 --> 00:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
there and and I've counted I just don't
 
00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:09.950 align:start position:0%
there and and I've counted I just don't
recall

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
recall
 
00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.730 align:start position:0%
recall
um

00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:13.609 --> 00:58:13.619 align:start position:0%
so those all cooperatives the other
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
thing I want to explain is all
 
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
cooperatives are comprised of what we
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
call pre-existing districts because
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of confusion about what
 
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
happens when a school district enters
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
into a Cooperative with another school
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
district and unless that school district
 
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
continues to operate elementary schools
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
or other schools it it disappears it is
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
absorbed into the Cooperative so
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
um we often think about them as the town
 
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
school districts still remaining there
 
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
is no Town School District in fact by
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
law if the Cooperative absorbs that
 
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:50.339 align:start position:0%
pre-existing School District as a member
 
00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
and that's important because when a
 
00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
Cooperative is formed in the
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
pre-existing school districts are
 
00:58:59.450 --> 00:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
absorbed in the Cooperative there it now
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
separate entity they're a separate
 
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
Municipal Corporation and the thinking
 
00:59:06.289 --> 00:59:06.299 align:start position:0%
behind that is they are doing it because
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
they are putting their own individual
 
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
town taxes and needs and in interest
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
aside for the collaborative Cooperative
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
um you know Improvement of education for
 
00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
all the kids in the co-op it's a sort of
 
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
holistic view of what is our
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility as a cooperative and that
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
is the spirit of why a lot of these
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
cooperatives were formed
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
um a bit of history on that in in 1961
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature formed a Cooperative
 
00:59:37.609 --> 00:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
study commission that provided the
 
00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:41.540 align:start position:0%
impetus for the adoption of 195 18.
 
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
the commissioner at the time was a big
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
supporter of the need to improve how we
 
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
were educating primarily our high school
 
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
students in particularly rural or poor
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
communities and so the Department of
 
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
Education was very supportive of let's
 
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
get out there and form these
 
01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:00.839 align:start position:0%
cooperatives and combine these school
 
01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:03.299 align:start position:0%
districts and regionalize education and
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
so the 1961 study which is available I
 
01:00:08.569 --> 01:00:08.579 align:start position:0%
have a copy I think I copied it from the
 
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
State library because my mentor John
 
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
Tague was very was very involved in in
 
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
studying that and um that document
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
really is the sort of the the driving
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
force behind the commissioner of
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
Education going out and actually doing
 
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
the matchmaking and putting the
 
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
districts together
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
and you probably are aware at the time
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
that the legislature offered a lot of
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
building aid for school districts to
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
build their Cooperative schools that
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
probably was the biggest motivating
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
factor for cooperatives forming in the
 
01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:40.970 align:start position:0%
factor for cooperatives forming in the
60s

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
60s
 
01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.530 align:start position:0%
60s
um

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
there's all there's a I'm happy to
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
answer questions there's a lot of
 
01:00:47.089 --> 01:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things I could go
 
01:00:47.099 --> 01:00:48.170 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things I could go
through

01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:50.579 align:start position:0%
um you ask the question
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
um is this a Statewide issue or is this
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
the sort of
 
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
individual issue I did a rough estimate
 
01:00:58.730 --> 01:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
you know of the
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the districts I work with
 
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
less than a third of them have have
 
01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
contemplated or have had a withdrawal
 
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
study Commission in the last you know
 
01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:11.339 align:start position:0%
five ten years uh so I wonder if that's
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
a kind of a relevant number like a third
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
of the state has sort of gone through
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
the process of saying should we talk
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
about withdrawal should we revise our
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
apportionment formula about a third of
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
my districts have gone through that
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
process from time to time
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
um withdrawal and the apportionment
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
process those are um those are subject
 
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
to votes by the legislative body and and
 
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
it all turns out on on turns on who
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
shows up
 
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
at the ballot to vote
 
01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
um or who shows up at the annual meeting
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
to vote it is inherently a democratic
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
process and
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
there are always winners and losers and
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
some folks are unhappy with losing and
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
it's it's a really tough thing because
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
the withdrawing town has to approve and
 
01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative has to approve we
 
01:01:59.930 --> 01:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
decided that once and for all when when
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
in that commission and we when the
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
legislature passed the revisions to
 
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.630 align:start position:0%
legislature passed the revisions to
195.25

01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
195.25
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's really the thing that is holding
 
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
a lot of it back is getting both bodies
 
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:14.579 align:start position:0%
to understand and to vote
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
um appropriately
 
01:02:18.049 --> 01:02:18.059 align:start position:0%
this is an incredibly complicated
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
process there are so many facets and
 
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
every Cooperative has its own different
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
political Dynamic there's so many legal
 
01:02:27.049 --> 01:02:27.059 align:start position:0%
issues there's dollars involved it's
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
incredibly hard advising from my
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
perspective advising superintendents and
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
school boards about what you're doing
 
01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:35.579 align:start position:0%
what are the implications what are the
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
documentation what what's the work you
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
have to do to study this it's very very
 
01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:41.329 align:start position:0%
have to do to study this it's very very
challenging

01:02:41.329 --> 01:02:41.339 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
imagine how much more challenging it is
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
than to roll that out to all the voters
 
01:02:50.089 --> 01:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
so everyone understands here's what
 
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
we're going sitting down and voting on
 
01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.270 align:start position:0%
we're going sitting down and voting on
today

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:53.990 align:start position:0%
today
um

01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's the big challenge is it's
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
complicated so
 
01:02:58.079 --> 01:02:58.809 align:start position:0%
complicated so
um

01:02:58.809 --> 01:02:58.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
I think Barrett answered the question
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
correctly the the way to do this is for
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
those study commissions to slow down
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
um to put in a the work
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
um and not try to rush it or wait to the
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
last minute because a lot of times it's
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
not a professional package when when
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
it's proposed at the end of the day and
 
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
that's often the complaint when it goes
 
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
before the state board or it goes before
 
01:03:23.809 --> 01:03:23.819 align:start position:0%
the voters that this was sort of a
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
half-baked effort it was thrown together
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
at the last minute the numbers aren't
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
accurate there's not enough detail in
 
01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal report the the dollars
 
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
more calculated correctly there's
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
assumptions that are often made that the
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
withdrawing districts kids will still
 
01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.059 align:start position:0%
get to continue to go to The Cooperative
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
High School which is not a guarantee
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
under the law so there's so many
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
assumptions made in these half-baked
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
withdrawal reports that the voters
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
aren't confident in them and often
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why they fail in my
 
01:03:54.839 --> 01:03:56.089 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why they fail in my
experience

01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:57.530 align:start position:0%
experience
um

01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh I I have I wanted to talk a little
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
bit I know we haven't even we've talked
 
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
sort of generally I wanted to dig in a
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
little bit on
 
01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
on the actual legislation 1679 the
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
dissolution bill I mean from a legal
 
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
perspective I think that's just a
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
non-starter no offense but I can't even
 
01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
possibly fathom how that could happen I
 
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
I think it's interesting to throw this
 
01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
idea out for sort of conceptual reasons
 
01:04:28.609 --> 01:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
but um for me it it's it's uh it's
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
unfathomable because I don't know how
 
01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:33.059 align:start position:0%
all those districts would then negotiate
 
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
all those tuition agreements with all
 
01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
the all the high schools it would the
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
cost would be astronomical
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
um and I don't and ultimately and
 
01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:45.299 align:start position:0%
fundamentally politically uh you have a
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
legislature making decisions for the the
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
local communities
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
um I feel like that's a local community
 
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
decision and it just really ought to
 
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
remain a local community decision
 
01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:56.690 align:start position:0%
remain a local community decision
um

01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
I think 1399 uh is an interesting bill
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
because it attempts for the first time
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
to fix some of the issues that exist in
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
the statute with respect to the the
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
disposition of property after a
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
withdrawal and this gets into the
 
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty and this is where I'm
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
telling you everybody gets really
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
confused and all wrapped up in what does
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
the law mean and what does the law say
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
um but 195 28 is the statute that that
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
really relates to what happens to the
 
01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
property in the districts that are
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
withdrawing from a co-op so if if I I
 
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what example we're using
 
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
right now that that makes sense and
 
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
that's sort of an easy one to think
 
01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
about but you let's say you have a
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
multi-district Cooperative formed made
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
up of several pre-existing towns and it
 
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
covers K through 12.
 
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
preschool through 12.
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of co-ops out there
 
01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:57.140 align:start position:0%
but let's just take that simple model
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
K-12 multi-pre-existing School District
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
Cooperative in one town has an
 
01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
elementary school and they withdraw
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
what happens with that elementary school
 
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
who pays whom for what
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
and how much
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
is really what 195 28 talks about and so
 
01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
the current language in 195 28 that I
 
01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:22.490 align:start position:0%
the current language in 195 28 that I
think

01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
throws a wrench in the process is the
 
01:06:29.809 --> 01:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
withdrawing District gets titled to
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
their property they get title to their
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
school it's the transfer of ownership
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
from Cooperative back to the town after
 
01:06:38.569 --> 01:06:38.579 align:start position:0%
withdrawal you get it now you're you're
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
you become your own District you're
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
reformed as as a district you get your
 
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
school only after it pays
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
The Cooperative
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
for all of the capital expenditures
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
improvements that the Cooperative has
 
01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.270 align:start position:0%
improvements that the Cooperative has
made

01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the history of its existence
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty daunting I mean in 1960
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
whatever three or 1977 when they came up
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
with that the co-ops were 15 20 years
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
old so it was like all right you know
 
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
that makes sense well now we're looking
 
01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
back at 60 we're only 60 years ago how
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
you know there was a there was a new
 
01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
roof put on that building that's been
 
01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
replaced twice but now we're expected to
 
01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
to reimburse the co-op for the capital
 
01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
outlay for the roof it doesn't make
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
sense so as a result we end up kind of
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
fudging the numbers or saying well we'll
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
look back 30 years or some other amount
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
of time but the fact is the dollar
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
amount at the end of the day
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
is huge
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
um and it's huge dollars regardless of
 
01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
the condition of the school
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
um you know how much it you know what
 
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.579 align:start position:0%
its actual value might be it's not a
 
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
value based it's just the the actual
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
money spent so 13.99 proposes
 
01:07:56.809 --> 01:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
a different method but it's not a good
 
01:07:59.329 --> 01:07:59.339 align:start position:0%
method either it's closer to being a
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
good method but it's not a good method
 
01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:05.339 align:start position:0%
um because it says that the withdrawing
 
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
District gets paid
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
for its proportional share of the net
 
01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
equity and the remaining buildings and
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
then the Cooperative has to has to pay
 
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
them to get they get their bill the
 
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
kernel States the so it says hold on
 
01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:22.789 align:start position:0%
kernel States the so it says hold on
um

01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
takes its buildings with them and must
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
pay back to the other members of the
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
co-op each member's proportional share
 
01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
in the net Equity so so the building is
 
01:08:32.699 --> 01:08:34.490 align:start position:0%
in the net Equity so so the building is
appraised

01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
appraised
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
and the withdrawing District only has to
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
pay back the the entire co-back Co-op
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
for its proportional share of the value
 
01:08:45.289 --> 01:08:45.299 align:start position:0%
of the building
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
so it's like it only has to pay like
 
01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
this this tiny amount so let's say that
 
01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:51.179 align:start position:0%
that elementary school is worth a
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
and there are five districts they only
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
have to pay
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand dollars is that
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
the right math
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
right they only have to pay this tiny
 
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
amount yet they're getting the full
 
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
value of their building back is that the
 
01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
Cooperative paid for
 
01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
so that method isn't fair either because
 
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
it it really
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
um it's very one-sided it just favors
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
the the withdrawing districts interest
 
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
over that of the co-op in the remaining
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
towns they're basically getting the bad
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
end of the stick the withdrawing
 
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
district is getting its building back
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
for a song so what makes more sense to
 
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
me is to is that the withdrawing
 
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
district has to pay the co-op for the
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
actual value of the building you're
 
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
getting your building what's it worth
 
01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
pay the co-op you get your building
 
01:09:43.739 --> 01:09:44.450 align:start position:0%
pay the co-op you get your building
um

01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
that's almost what 1399 accomplishes but
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get there it could could get
 
01:09:51.239 --> 01:09:52.370 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get there it could could get
there

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
um I have another concern with 1399
 
01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
section 2 talks about the value of
 
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
property being appraised by a
 
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
three-person committee
 
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
it's a fine idea I'm sure we could sort
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
of nitpick that idea of an appraisal the
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
problem is I see it into is it doesn't
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
actually dictate what the appraisal
 
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
method is what's are we going to base it
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
on fair market value what's the fair
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
market value of a school building built
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
in 1920.
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
that has a new roof you know what I mean
 
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
like there is no really good Market or
 
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
Fair way to calculate fair market value
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
if you ask real estate appraisers to
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
appraise the fair market value of old
 
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
elementary school buildings they're all
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
over the place and I don't think that
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
serves anybody because it's you could
 
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
end up with an astronomically High
 
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
number or a really weird low number so
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
the better method
 
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
um is like the cost
 
01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:47.149 align:start position:0%
um is like the cost
um

01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
you take the replacement cost
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
so what would it cost to build a new
 
01:10:51.719 --> 01:10:52.550 align:start position:0%
so what would it cost to build a new
school

01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
minus depreciation which is a method
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
they use and a lot of different a lot of
 
01:10:59.689 --> 01:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
similar circumstances so that's a
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
different and maybe a better way of
 
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
calculating what the value is of that
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
old school building replacement cost
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
minus depreciation because it would cost
 
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars in today's dollars to
 
01:11:12.649 --> 01:11:12.659 align:start position:0%
buy that school but it's we've had it
 
01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
for 40 years so what's the current value
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
today that's a that's an appropriate
 
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
appraisal method
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
part two doesn't dictate an appraisal
 
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
method it needs to I don't think we
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
should delegate that to a three-person
 
01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
committee without the legislature saying
 
01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
what that method should be I'm not
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
saying I know for sure but I'm giving an
 
01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
example of one potentially better method
 
01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
that would be fair
 
01:11:38.209 --> 01:11:38.219 align:start position:0%
to the withdrawing district and that
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
would be fair to the remaining members
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the co-op
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
um before you stump go to the next bill
 
01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
yep 13.99 what happens if the the
 
01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
building which is in the
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
withdrawing District
 
01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
is not owned by the co-op District
 
01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
but owned by the withdrawing District
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's not that's not a it's not a
 
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
possibility that exists
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
are you talking about Woodsville April
 
01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
no I'm from Woodsville Haverhill and I'm
 
01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
not so fine with their Co-op so we have
 
01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
another District in the state where they
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
own the building one of the buildings
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
which is an elementary building
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
they own it clear the village District
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
owns it
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
the statue doesn't address that if so it
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
might be really simple if the
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
withdrawing School District owns the
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
building and that's actually clear and
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's no dispute about it and by the
 
01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
way oh title and ownership is one of
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
those really sometimes difficult things
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
to prove there's no question on this uh
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
let you know it's town is Bridgewater
 
01:12:47.689 --> 01:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
okay and they have title ownership no
 
01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
debt on their building so so the answer
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
is what why does that why do they have
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
to pay anything back to the co-op if
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
they own the property other than the
 
01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
cost of Capital Improvements maybe that
 
01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
the co-op made to other buildings no to
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
the to that building they are building
 
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
to their building yes yeah there's got
 
01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
to be some reimbursement to the co-op
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
for the improvements that the co-op paid
 
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
but in in co-ops made no maintenance has
 
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
been paid by Bridgewater that doesn't
 
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
seem that confusing to me from just a
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
logical standpoint and the statute
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't address that currently
 
01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
the bridge their Co-op they go to
 
01:13:27.649 --> 01:13:27.659 align:start position:0%
Newfound for beyond the Elementary
 
01:13:27.659 --> 01:13:29.330 align:start position:0%
Newfound for beyond the Elementary
grades

01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
grades
 
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
Chris so 195 28 addresses the the
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
disposition of property owned by the
 
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
co-op not owned by other entities so
 
01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
that it's not really that's a completely
 
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
separate issue and Bridgewater can hire
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
their own lawyer and their lawyer can
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
tell them what what happens if that
 
01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
buildings leased to the co-op for a
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
dollar a year
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's subject to the terms of the lease
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
agreement again that's occurring not not
 
01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
part of 195.28 so that's a separate
 
01:13:59.209 --> 01:13:59.219 align:start position:0%
contractual arrangement I don't want to
 
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
weigh in on the contract between
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater and you know a school
 
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
district but that's a that's one of
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
those one-year 99-year leases for a
 
01:14:06.719 --> 01:14:07.370 align:start position:0%
those one-year 99-year leases for a
dollar

01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's still a a property
 
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
interest that
 
01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
um the co-op has in the use of the
 
01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
building so they have to figure out how
 
01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
to deal with terminating that lease but
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's between those entities
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
every five years yeah so that's not part
 
01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
of 195.28
 
01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.870 align:start position:0%
of 195.28
um

01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
the other part of one of 1399 which is
 
01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
very one-sided and and it's just going
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
to frustrate efforts for withdrawal is
 
01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
it says that the withdrawing District
 
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
takes its school buildings with them but
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
must pay back to the other members
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
um the each member's proportional share
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
and the net Equity of the co-op
 
01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.310 align:start position:0%
and the net Equity of the co-op
buildings

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
um so current law states that the
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
withdrawing District must pay the co-op
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
back for the actual cost of Capital
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
Improvements we've already talked about
 
01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.229 align:start position:0%
Improvements we've already talked about
that

01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:57.239 --> 01:14:59.290 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:14:59.290 --> 01:14:59.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
can you explain that again because it
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
says in the co-op buildings
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
so if there are schools if if the
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
withdrawing Town leaves and there are
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
other schools in the co-op the um it
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
says that the withdrawing District gets
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
paid for its proportional share and the
 
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
value of the rest of the buildings okay
 
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
so it's leaving it's abandoning the
 
01:15:27.169 --> 01:15:27.179 align:start position:0%
co-op there's all this property the
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
withdrawing District under 13.99 would
 
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
get paid for its proportional
 
01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
uh interest in the the buildings that
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's abandoning current law says the
 
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
drawing District if you leave you're
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
forfeiting your equity in all the
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
buildings that are left in the co-op you
 
01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
keep your own you pay your for your own
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
building but you forfeit your equity in
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
the other in the other buildings it's
 
01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
meant to be a little bit difficult to
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
withdraw this system kind of flips it
 
01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
around and says well you get paid back
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
for whatever Equity you have in the
 
01:15:59.570 --> 01:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
remaining buildings and and the reason
 
01:16:01.729 --> 01:16:01.739 align:start position:0%
that's unfair is that the the
 
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
pre-existing districts in the co-op
 
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
I get stunk twice because they have to
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
cut a check
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the pre-existing District that just
 
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
withdrew right and they have to continue
 
01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
paying for the operating costs of those
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
districts even after that one of their
 
01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
members leads and the debt and the debt
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
the debt these guys are the the
 
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
withdrawing district will still have
 
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
some indebtedness obligation yeah but
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is assuming there's no debt okay so
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
the co-op has to cut a check and they
 
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
have to continue operating the building
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
with one of its members gone that's just
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
gonna make the the co-ops never going to
 
01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
vote in support of that kind of
 
01:16:42.649 --> 01:16:42.659 align:start position:0%
withdrawal plan because it it Saddles
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
them twice with with the money they're
 
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
going to cut a huge check and they they
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
have to keep operating with that member
 
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
gone so that provision I think
 
01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and there probably is a better
 
01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
provision but that's really that's part
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
three of 13.99
 
01:17:01.679 --> 01:17:02.450 align:start position:0%
three of 13.99
um

01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
part five of 13 uh 1399 addresses the
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
Assumption of indebtedness
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
um it it it it it says upon payments um
 
01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
The Cooperative District shall transfer
 
01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
and convey title to any building the the
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
pre-existing District remember that the
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
the district that withdrew shall assume
 
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
any remaining indebtedness for such
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
School building land or facilities it's
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
really easy to say that and be like oh
 
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
that's nice and clean
 
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
the problem is that
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
um if if if they withdraw with their
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
building but the bond was issued by the
 
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
Cooperative it's not just a matter of
 
01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
saying all right now we have the Bond as
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
the town of of of Acme no we you can't
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
just transfer bonds back and forth that
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
actually undercuts the in the entire
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
Bond and you know we I have Bond counsel
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
in in my firm and we've we've spoken to
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
them about this but simply
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
um stating that doesn't address the
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
consequences of how you transfer it Bond
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
debt between municipalities
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
um the risk here is huge because if if
 
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
you do it improperly then the bond loses
 
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
its tax-exempt status and all of a
 
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
sudden the municipality
 
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
assumes the indebtedness but also the
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
bond is no longer tax exempt so that
 
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
municipality has to pay taxes that they
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
haven't paid
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's a I'm not doing a sort of Doom
 
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
and Gloom thing I'm just saying you peek
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
under the bond stuff and you look at the
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
Arbitrage rules for bonds it's a it's a
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
very complicated area of the law there's
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
not a lot of people in the state who do
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
it and I just would say be very cautious
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
about dealing with transferring
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
debt between one municipality which
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
issued the bond to another municipality
 
01:18:54.169 --> 01:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
which didn't exist when the bond was
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
issued it's not that simple and I'm
 
01:18:59.090 --> 01:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
going to leave it there because
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not a bond attorney I don't even
 
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
pretend to be one and I have a couple of
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
we have we have a municipal Finance
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
um group in our office and I'll I'll
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
refer to them when I get a call
 
01:19:09.659 --> 01:19:10.370 align:start position:0%
refer to them when I get a call
um

01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:11.689 --> 01:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
um I know Barrett said this and you're
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
already talking about this I think a
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
study Commission of co-ops is like so
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
long overdue right it's been since 19
 
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
the 1990s and
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
um we we are a different state we have a
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
different view on school choice in New
 
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh things cost a lot more
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
money than they cost back back in the
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
90s and certainly back in the 60s
 
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
um we need a commission we need people
 
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
on the commission from different parts
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
of the state and also different uh areas
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
of expertise that can advise the
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
commission on these complex issues I
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
think that's where I at least 13.99
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
which has has some POS has some
 
01:19:52.199 --> 01:19:53.450 align:start position:0%
which has has some POS has some
potential

01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:54.290 align:start position:0%
potential
um

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
and I I I'm not even going to really
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
address 1366 that's really just a
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
political a political thing in my view
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
in 13 in 1679 is a non-starter but with
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
respect to 1399 and some of the
 
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
remaining issues that co-ops are
 
01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
encountering a commission is
 
01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
I think a really good idea I'd be happy
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
to attend I'd happy to sit be sit on it
 
01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
I was on the 2017 commission and um
 
01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
offer my assistance just because I find
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
this to be really interesting work
 
01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
primarily and also
 
01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
um I think the state needs to figure
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
some of these issues out and I'm gonna
 
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
I'll stay for questions but thank you
 
01:20:35.209 --> 01:20:35.219 align:start position:0%
thank you very much informative uh
 
01:20:35.219 --> 01:20:36.530 align:start position:0%
thank you very much informative uh
questions

01:20:36.530 --> 01:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
it has representative Cornell Thank you
 
01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
said on the last commission some of the
 
01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:45.500 align:start position:0%
things didn't come out right because
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
there wasn't the knowledge that should
 
01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
have been there so if we did recommend
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
another commission like what kind of
 
01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
background or people should be on that
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
commission I think someone from the the
 
01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
dra who can advise with respect to
 
01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.189 align:start position:0%
dra who can advise with respect to
appraisals

01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
appraisals
 
01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
um someone familiar with you know real
 
01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
estate appraisals potentially
 
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:08.990 align:start position:0%
estate appraisals potentially
um

01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know folks in the community who who
 
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
want to put the legwork into figuring
 
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
out how to how to um
 
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:17.810 align:start position:0%
out how to how to um
uh

01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
how to deal with the debt and the bond
 
01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:20.209 align:start position:0%
how to deal with the debt and the bond
issue

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:20.219 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
um I think those are those are big
 
01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:23.810 align:start position:0%
um I think those are those are big
concerns

01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.070 align:start position:0%
concerns
um

01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
you know I think we and I think the idea
 
01:21:29.689 --> 01:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
that that that uh Barrett raised was a
 
01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
good idea that we want to hear
 
01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
we want to hear from the community
 
01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
members to figure out what the issues
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
are because what happens is
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
one person from this Cooperative who
 
01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
lives in this town has this perspective
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
on co-ops
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
this person from this town has a totally
 
01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
different perspective on co-ops there
 
01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
are some co-ops that are just high
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
schools there are some that are Middle
 
01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
School through high school there are
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
some that are K through 12.
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
um and so everyone really does have a
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
different experience and so last time we
 
01:22:05.689 --> 01:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
spent almost all of our time just trying
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
to understand the nature of the Beast
 
01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
and then all the work about how to fix
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
it we tried to kind of do really quickly
 
01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:14.219 align:start position:0%
and it really resulted in a couple of
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
bills but one Amendment came out of the
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
commission that we thought was going to
 
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
really work and that ended up resulting
 
01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
in the change to 195 18 but I think it's
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
going to take longer it's going to take
 
01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
more work to really understand for all
 
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
the people to understand the nature of
 
01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
the co-ops
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
Jim I see on the that commission I have
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
that membership in front of me right now
 
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
that occurred on the Grine year there
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
was a representation from the Department
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
of Revenue Administration did they bring
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
that type of expertise in or do you need
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
somebody more specifically you know
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
Stephen Hamilton was present he did it
 
01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
he was very kind with his time he did a
 
01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
quick overview of of some of the issues
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't a it wasn't really digging
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
in like someone who could really just
 
01:23:02.890 --> 01:23:02.900 align:start position:0%
dig in and help out and come up with
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
static Solutions in language I mean he
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
he was helpful but I'm not sure I'm not
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
sure he really knew what the dra's role
 
01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.229 align:start position:0%
sure he really knew what the dra's role
was

01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:23:12.239 --> 01:23:12.830 align:start position:0%
was
um

01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
and so he provided helpful uh overview
 
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
um I know there was a representative
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
from the doe who's who's here today and
 
01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
and there was help from that end too but
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
I just I I it has to be at the outset
 
01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
there has to be an intention to kind of
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
fix some of these problems identify what
 
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
they are fix them but first understand
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
what the nature is of all these co-ops
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:23:40.729 --> 01:23:40.739 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Cornell
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
every Co-op is different and has
 
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
different contracts or agreements would
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
a commission even be able to come up
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
with a solution for all of them of how
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
to do things when they're all different
 
01:23:54.649 --> 01:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
or should it just be local control and
 
01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
the people getting together from those
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
co-ops and making decisions for
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
themselves right rather than us telling
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
them what to do I think um there's a
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
framework right now and the framework
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
allows for local control amendment of um
 
01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
of Articles of agreement but there are
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
some Provisions that really tie off
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
people's hands and some of those
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
Provisions for example the disposition
 
01:24:21.649 --> 01:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
of property language do tie the hands of
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
the study of the of the withdrawing with
 
01:24:25.970 --> 01:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
potentially withdrawing towns they do
 
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
tie the hands of the Cooperative that
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
would remain in place so we should be
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
looking at how with a lighter touch can
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
we modify some of those restrictions
 
01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
without really kind of taking the whole
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
thing apart and starting all over again
 
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ford
 
01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you sir for
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
taking our questions
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
to what extent does geography play
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
a factor in this and such as two
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
elementary schools owned by a co-op
 
01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
one's in one town one's in the other but
 
01:25:05.689 --> 01:25:05.699 align:start position:0%
one's a new building and the other one's
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
an old building and you start trying to
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
decide who gets what when you divide all
 
01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:13.070 align:start position:0%
decide who gets what when you divide all
this

01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean geography and and
 
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
socio-economic demographics I think play
 
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
a huge part and what ends up happening
 
01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
in my experience is
 
01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:26.689 align:start position:0%
in my experience is
cooperatives

01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
cooperatives
 
01:25:26.699 --> 01:25:27.470 align:start position:0%
cooperatives
um

01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
and not everyone but some people in the
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
community have a different idea than
 
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
other people in the community about
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
what's fair and what's right and so for
 
01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:38.330 align:start position:0%
what's fair and what's right and so for
instance

01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
um sometimes you look at the cost the
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
operating costs of the district in
 
01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
apportionment formulas and you'll heal
 
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
hear members of the community saying
 
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
well my per pupil cost in my town is
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
twenty eight thousand dollars and the
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
per pupil cost in that other town is
 
01:25:55.729 --> 01:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
only you know eighteen thousand dollars
 
01:25:58.729 --> 01:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
and that has to do with the equalized
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
valuation and if the property with more
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation they're going to
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
have a higher per pupil cost because
 
01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
they have higher property values and
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
more ability to pay that high per pupil
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
cost but they'll think that's unfair
 
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
because they're looking at the the cost
 
01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
for per student whereas some people will
 
01:26:21.649 --> 01:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
say well that's fair because you have
 
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
you have the ability to raise that money
 
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
in your community and we're doing this
 
01:26:28.129 --> 01:26:28.139 align:start position:0%
together and we agreed we're going to do
 
01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
this together so it really comes down to
 
01:26:33.010 --> 01:26:33.020 align:start position:0%
how people think about philosophically
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
what's fair
 
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
what's more important my town
 
01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
or the collective Cooperative as a whole
 
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's I think more the most important
 
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
issue whether you're in Pittsfield or
 
01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
Hollis or you know Keen Monadnock or you
 
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
know want to come it it's it's always
 
01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
the same conversation I go to 20 30
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
school district meetings every year and
 
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
it's this it's the same conversations
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
um and people are very smart all across
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
the state and they're very tied in with
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
these issues and it's always a very
 
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
similar conversation
 
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you that's so
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's a heavy heavy topic uh the prior
 
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
chair Ways and Means or you know now
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
retired was very concerned about what we
 
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
were doing last year because he came
 
01:27:23.689 --> 01:27:23.699 align:start position:0%
from one of those towns just mentioned
 
01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
that you know was had the dollars and
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
and well I won't go any further than
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
that but it's it's really it can this
 
01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
whole conversation can end up like a
 
01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
donor Town versus non-donor Town type
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
discussion it is a it is a miniature
 
01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:40.139 align:start position:0%
version of that I mean the co-ops like
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
Barrett said they were they were a
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
marriage between you know not rich and
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
poor I don't want to but but the the
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
towns that didn't have a lot of property
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
value were put with the towns that did
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
because I mean and so it is literally a
 
01:27:59.209 --> 01:27:59.219 align:start position:0%
miniature version of New Hampshire
 
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much uh you're
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
informative as usual thank you I are
 
01:28:07.129 --> 01:28:07.139 align:start position:0%
there any folks from specific co-ops
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
that have issues that would like to
 
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
discuss those or present those issues to
 
01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:12.350 align:start position:0%
discuss those or present those issues to
us

01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%

01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%

this time
 
01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:25.490 align:start position:0%
this time
foreign

foreign
 
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tanner can we hear
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education yes I
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
was going to do that after we you know
 
01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.370 align:start position:0%
was going to do that after we you know
okay

01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
good morning Miss Fenton
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes I think there was another
 
01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:48.970 align:start position:0%
yes I think there was another
superintendent

01:28:48.970 --> 01:28:48.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay he's playing your cards well
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
so as you all know uh the only thing
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
that makes
 
01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
having one attorney is having two
 
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
attorneys so I'm happy to introduce Liz
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
Brown she's also with the Department of
 
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.610 align:start position:0%
Brown she's also with the Department of
Education

01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
Education
 
01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:19.310 align:start position:0%
Education
um

01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Diana Fenton
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney with the Department of
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
Education it's always nice to see
 
01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
everyone I'm happy to answer any
 
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
questions and I always love when
 
01:29:30.169 --> 01:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner has a question for
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
me because I know it's going to be a
 
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
good one
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:29:37.129 --> 01:29:37.139 align:start position:0%
I like Barrett uh was not around in the
 
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
60s hard to believe
 
01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:39.709 align:start position:0%
60s hard to believe
um

01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
I can tell you during my tenure with the
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that we have
 
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
received calls from districts asking
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions about the statute similar to
 
01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
what Barrett testified to we do not
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
um represent any particular district and
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
so I I guide them the best I can through
 
01:29:59.689 --> 01:29:59.699 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
walk them through that process we always
 
01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
encourage the districts to speak to
 
01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
their local Council
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
and and have that person assist them
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
with that process we really can't do a a
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
very deep dive on it it is for that
 
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
District to reach out to their Council
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
but what we largely do is kind of assist
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
them with the paperwork and getting it
 
01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
ready to go in front of the State Board
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
and so that's
 
01:30:31.129 --> 01:30:31.139 align:start position:0%
um where I myself have have assisted
 
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
many districts and just making sure that
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
the formalities and the paperwork are
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the State Board I can't
 
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
recall the last time that we had
 
01:30:43.610 --> 01:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
um a withdrawal come before the state
 
01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
board but I can tell you that
 
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
um when when they have come before the
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
State Board one of the areas of concern
 
01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
that I would encourage this committee to
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
look at regardless of which legislative
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
path you take on the bills before you
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
is to think about what role the State
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
Board of Education uh plays in this
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
process and what I mean by that is all
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
this paperwork comes in front of the
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
state board and the state board has
 
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.090 align:start position:0%
state board and the state board has
historically

01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:31:16.810 --> 01:31:16.820 align:start position:0%
kind of said in in fewer words perhaps
 
01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
well what do we what do we do with this
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
what is our analysis how deep can we
 
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
dive on this and I know sometimes the
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
State Board in the past has felt like it
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
is simply a an administrative rubber
 
01:31:31.729 --> 01:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
stamp that the work has been done and
 
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
now they just have to approve it and
 
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
send it along other times the board
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
which as you all know changes in terms
 
01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
of its makeup other times the board has
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
pushed back and asked some questions
 
01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with this piece
 
01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
of property where are the students going
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
um and so depending on the formation of
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
the board you're going to get very
 
01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
different questions asked but that has
 
01:31:58.490 --> 01:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
been kind of an area that the board has
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
struggled with perhaps I'm sure and
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
again I'm not here to speak on behalf of
 
01:32:04.610 --> 01:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
the board of education but I'm sure
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
clarity as to what that role should be
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
and is would be appreciated
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
um along your lines to further answer
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
your question representative Tanner we
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
have received calls from constituents
 
01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:21.900 align:start position:0%
who are upset about their about their
 
01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:23.209 align:start position:0%
who are upset about their about their
Cooperative

01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
Cooperative
 
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
um wanting to withdraw from it
 
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
explaining that it's it's an unfair
 
01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:29.270 align:start position:0%
explaining that it's it's an unfair
process

01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
um it's a marriage that cannot end in
 
01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
some parents that cannot end I have uh
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
in the past I have been sent to school
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
board meetings of various cooperatives I
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
went to Jeffrey wrench
 
01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
um for a school board meeting where
 
01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
their Cooperative was having some issues
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
I've been to Orford in Vermont New
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire border I'm trying to address
 
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
some of these issues I think the role
 
01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
the department plays is somewhat limited
 
01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:56.699 align:start position:0%
and it is always just coming back to to
 
01:32:58.970 --> 01:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
the law in what is allowed under the law
 
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
we are not there to advise we're not
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
there to guide so a lot of the time I
 
01:33:07.010 --> 01:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
spend listening to the concerns and
 
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
trying to to direct the best I can so I
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
I have made those trips myself
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
um to various times but I I do so with
 
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
another attorney from a firm such as Jim
 
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
O'Shaughnessy or other firms that
 
01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
represent districts in that capacity and
 
01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
really defer to that individual
 
01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:29.510 align:start position:0%
really defer to that individual
um

01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
so sometimes I'm not sure how helpful my
 
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
role is but yes I have been to the
 
01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:37.189 align:start position:0%
role is but yes I have been to the
meetings

01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:33:38.689 --> 01:33:38.699 align:start position:0%
um there was a question that was asked
 
01:33:41.209 --> 01:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
earlier about and I just want to make
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
sure that I address the point um and
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a little background of who
 
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
I am and how I ended up here because I I
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
think I was involved in that last
 
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
withdrawal study and it's just sort of
 
01:33:57.370 --> 01:33:57.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
I believe I was roped in by two
 
01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
attorneys that are behind me one to my
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
right and one to my left
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
um so um at the time I believe I may
 
01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
have been the chair of the Hollis
 
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
Brookline Cooperative School District I
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
was the chair for about three years I
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
was on the board for almost nine before
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
um I was hired by the commissioner to be
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
counseled to the Department of Education
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
I've only been at the department now
 
01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
since June
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
um so I'm still relatively new and so I
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
fielded far less called I guess from
 
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
constituents and school districts than
 
01:34:32.810 --> 01:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
Diana has in her last several years I
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
think we met originally when I was
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
active on the board we met on the steady
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
commission yeah so um and uh so we've
 
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
had these conversations for a while so I
 
01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good understanding of at
 
01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
least one Co-op
 
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and I've been on the study commission
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
and kind of remember the work and I
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
um the work that Barrett and Jim
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
previously described and how that
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
committee went is would be an accurate
 
01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:00.179 align:start position:0%
description of how I would describe that
 
01:35:00.179 --> 01:35:01.129 align:start position:0%
description of how I would describe that
work

01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
um is it was a lot of work tried to be
 
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
done in a very short amount of time
 
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
after there was a lot of venting because
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
we learned that the co-ops were all very
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
very different
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
um and they all come but one of the
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
questions I want to make sure that I
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
address just so you know in my short
 
01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.450 align:start position:0%
address just so you know in my short
tenure

01:35:17.450 --> 01:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
tenure
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
um there was and ironically I was on the
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
board that had the the re-look at our
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement so
 
01:35:28.129 --> 01:35:28.139 align:start position:0%
um back about eight months ago
 
01:35:30.649 --> 01:35:30.659 align:start position:0%
um the Hollis Brookline Cooperative had
 
01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
a special meeting to have a vote on
 
01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
amending the house Cooperative agreement
 
01:35:40.090 --> 01:35:40.100 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement because it became
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
apparent to some members of the board
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
that they were kind of outdated there
 
01:35:46.729 --> 01:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
was just things that didn't reflect what
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
we did they didn't reflect the times
 
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
they didn't reflect current law so those
 
01:35:54.169 --> 01:35:54.179 align:start position:0%
were amended by the by the town like a
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
special meeting of the co-op there was a
 
01:35:59.330 --> 01:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
vote and then those articles of
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
agreement just came before the State
 
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
Board of Education
 
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
um in July and those were reviewed so
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
there are just there are co-ops that are
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
actively reviewing them and going
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
through that full process I don't know
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
if there's other but that is one that
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
has I've encountered since I've been
 
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
employed by the by the board of uh the
 
01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
department of the Department of
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
Education and Advising the board yes
 
01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
sorry maybe more coffee would be a good
 
01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
idea this morning but that is one that
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
has come before us in the last three
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
months why I've been at the department
 
01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
just so you are aware of that one thank
 
01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
you during the time you were doing that
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
I sat beside in the house he
 
01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
representative came from Brookline I
 
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:45.179 align:start position:0%
heard about Co-op issues every day I was
 
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
sitting in session
 
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
um I won't mention his name but you
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
don't need to you know who I'm talking
 
01:36:53.209 --> 01:36:53.219 align:start position:0%
about okay
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
um so then the the question I have to
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
you and and of course you're one of
 
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
three that were on the previous
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
Commission in this room right now four
 
01:37:03.169 --> 01:37:03.179 align:start position:0%
of us four of you on it the Two of Us in
 
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
Barrett and Jim okay and so I've I've
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
heard just recently from the prior
 
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
speaker here that it would be a good
 
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
idea to have a commission study to
 
01:37:15.649 --> 01:37:15.659 align:start position:0%
eliminate some of the confused uh
 
01:37:17.689 --> 01:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
language within law and help streamline
 
01:37:17.699 --> 01:37:19.010 align:start position:0%
language within law and help streamline
that

01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
um are you of the same opinion
 
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
I actually think that would be a good
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
idea I think that would be a
 
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
comprehensive look
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
um because each of these statutes impact
 
01:37:32.209 --> 01:37:32.219 align:start position:0%
other statutes
 
01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
um for example if we looked at the and I
 
01:37:35.689 --> 01:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
don't remember the house bill but the
 
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
house bill that would basically
 
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
eliminate all the Cooperative 16 19 97.
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
um that would have impact on things like
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
building Aid
 
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
um and so it needs to be a comprehensive
 
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
look once you've changed one statute
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
that deals with co-ops it's going to
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
change two or three other statutes that
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
are not in a cooperative
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
statute you know realm they're going to
 
01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
change other things so it needs to be a
 
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
much more comprehensive look
 
01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and I actually think Vera's
 
01:38:06.169 --> 01:38:06.179 align:start position:0%
suggestion of having you know allowing
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
some districts to come in and and talk
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
and and vent and um because I have had a
 
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
district come um before me at this point
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
um already as well I've been at the um
 
01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.750 align:start position:0%
um already as well I've been at the um
Department

01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
Department
 
01:38:19.729 --> 01:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
um really being in that unhappy marriage
 
01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
because they're a small District that
 
01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
can't effectuate the change
 
01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
um because they can't get enough votes
 
01:38:27.169 --> 01:38:27.179 align:start position:0%
but I do think there's there's a lot of
 
01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
different flavors
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
um of co-ops um and I think that that
 
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
might be a really good place to start
 
01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
and examining these but also allow more
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and careful look at how a
 
01:38:42.410 --> 01:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
change in one statute would impact a
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
number of other non-cooperative related
 
01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.129 align:start position:0%
number of other non-cooperative related
statutes

01:38:48.129 --> 01:38:48.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think we've talked about like a
 
01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.270 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think we've talked about like a
mission

01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
mission
 
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the right way to go
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
and it's important to note it's a
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
commission not a legislative committee
 
01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:02.209 align:start position:0%
commission not a legislative committee
yeah

01:39:02.209 --> 01:39:02.219 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:39:04.729 --> 01:39:04.739 align:start position:0%
because there's a huge difference
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
between the voices that are in the room
 
01:39:09.649 --> 01:39:09.659 align:start position:0%
in the legislative committee vis-a-vis
 
01:39:11.629 --> 01:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
that of a commission
 
01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
where you have people from the public
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
who are engaged in the commission work
 
01:39:18.169 --> 01:39:18.179 align:start position:0%
where you can't in a legislative
 
01:39:18.179 --> 01:39:19.250 align:start position:0%
where you can't in a legislative
committee

01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important to have those
 
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
voices there
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
because there is vested interest in
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
there and there's experience that those
 
01:39:29.450 --> 01:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
of us that are in the legislative part
 
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
of it don't have
 
01:39:34.490 --> 01:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
so I would I would concur
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
that as we look at this uh Mr chairman
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
that we continue to focus on on the
 
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
commission work and not a legislative
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee work
 
01:39:47.689 --> 01:39:47.699 align:start position:0%
well that that's why you know when I did
 
01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
appoint Jim uh Grenier as the chair of
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
that it was a commission study and we
 
01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
saw that and I think that what you're
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
saying is absolutely so that we want the
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
expertise out there we've muddled around
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
through this for so long uh we need to
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
have some of that
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
we need some accountants on there some
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
people that can assess things properly
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
and and and and give us the information
 
01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
we really need to make a
 
01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
good statute good law so are there any
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
further questions for you either uh
 
01:40:23.709 --> 01:40:23.719 align:start position:0%
attorneys Brown and Fenton
 
01:40:26.930 --> 01:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tanner thank you and
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just as
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
a follow-up you talked about how your
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
your actions at the State Department of
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
Education seem to be reactive to the
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
issues that are coming to you
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
um and as I pointed out
 
01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
in my ancient you know dinosaur years
 
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
um that at in the 60s when for example
 
01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
the Curious Arch District formulated
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of incentives in the
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education was really
 
01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
um supporting co-ops in many many ways
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
01:41:04.189 --> 01:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
talking to the uh you know they had
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
meetings and conferences with the
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
teachers that were going into that Co-op
 
01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
how how to work with the different
 
01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
schools coming together there was
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
building Aid that sort of thing
 
01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.250 align:start position:0%
building Aid that sort of thing
um

01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:17.930 align:start position:0%
um
today

01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:41:19.729 --> 01:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
what's happening at the Department of
 
01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
Education if anything to support the
 
01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:23.870 align:start position:0%
Education if anything to support the
co-ops

01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
co-ops
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
or to Simply react to the questions of
 
01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
I don't think there are any actions that
 
01:41:39.410 --> 01:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
you have described which occurred when
 
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
they were being formed nor would it seem
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the Department to
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
undertake that work since they have been
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
formed I think that was a reaction of
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
the of that particular time so I think
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
support that the department offers is
 
01:41:58.129 --> 01:41:58.139 align:start position:0%
the support that we that we offer to all
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
school districts and it's just kind of a
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
holistic approach but there's nothing
 
01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
particular to cooperatives such as you
 
01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
have described
 
01:42:07.729 --> 01:42:07.739 align:start position:0%
um that is being undertaken to the best
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
are there yes representative
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
we had a bit of a list
 
01:42:18.649 --> 01:42:18.659 align:start position:0%
started as to who should be on this
 
01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
well I would recommend Jim O'Shaughnessy
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh I was fascinated by his testimony
 
01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
as you know the department
 
01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:33.350 align:start position:0%
as you know the department
um

01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
we provide information and so it's a
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
rare occasion when I would say to you
 
01:42:41.209 --> 01:42:41.219 align:start position:0%
certainly this person certainly that
 
01:42:42.649 --> 01:42:42.659 align:start position:0%
person but
 
01:42:42.659 --> 01:42:43.250 align:start position:0%
person but
um

01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people out here
 
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
clearly that I have a lot of really
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
valuable information about cooperatives
 
01:42:53.450 --> 01:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
and that's the information that needs to
 
01:42:55.609 --> 01:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
be presented to this committee and and I
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
would encourage you
 
01:42:58.910 --> 01:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
um to reach out to those resources
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
namely when attorney O'Shaughnessy
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that attorney at his firm that
 
01:43:04.609 --> 01:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
works with bonds
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
um that's critical information to bring
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
forward to this committee and I can tell
 
01:43:11.450 --> 01:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
you that is a very specialized area
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
um certainly Falls far outside of my
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
purview and that's the kind of detailed
 
01:43:19.609 --> 01:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
information that this committee would
 
01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
would need and those resources and those
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
people are out there my experience from
 
01:43:28.129 --> 01:43:28.139 align:start position:0%
the last study Commission in 2017
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
um it was that it felt very rushed
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
it felt very rushed and I think the
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
subtext of all the testimony today is
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
that this is an area that needs a very
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
thoughtful approach
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
and to address uh representative
 
01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
Cornell's um concerning questions I
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
think that formula or that guidance or
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
that that that blueprint as I like to
 
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
call it can be achieved I think that
 
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
right balance can be struck but it's
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
going to take some time and what we've
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
seen over the legislative sessions every
 
01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
session there's a bill or two that deals
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
with cooperatives and you know that it's
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
a problem this legislative committee
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
knows it is an issue and what it needs
 
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
is a very thoughtful approach and that
 
01:44:11.689 --> 01:44:11.699 align:start position:0%
sometimes just takes time
 
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage this committee to
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
to do that it is a worthwhile endeavor
 
01:44:19.129 --> 01:44:19.139 align:start position:0%
the previous commission the the charge
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
and study purpose was a singular
 
01:44:25.129 --> 01:44:25.139 align:start position:0%
sentence here with a couple
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
bullets underneath it said the
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
commission shall study issues relating
 
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
to the withdrawal of pre-existing
 
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
districts from their Cooperative School
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
District including
 
01:44:37.609 --> 01:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
if we go with a commission would you
 
01:44:39.410 --> 01:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
recommend that there be a broader the
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
study the issues relating to Cooperative
 
01:44:43.729 --> 01:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
school districts period
 
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
I think that based upon the comments
 
01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
we've heard today I think that would be
 
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive although I think that
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
might be too large I mean maybe we need
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
to consider is it
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
um what all issues we want you know it's
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
withdrawal disillusion which are
 
01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.570 align:start position:0%
withdrawal disillusion which are
different

01:44:59.570 --> 01:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but it certainly needs to include
 
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
both of those
 
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
um and maybe include you know finance
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
and some other issues that could be
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
apportionment of board seats I don't
 
01:45:12.169 --> 01:45:12.179 align:start position:0%
know if you want to go as broad as just
 
01:45:14.450 --> 01:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
simply the study of cooperatives
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I think that might become
 
01:45:17.209 --> 01:45:17.219 align:start position:0%
overwhelming and you might have a
 
01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
five-year study commission rather than a
 
01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:20.510 align:start position:0%
five-year study commission rather than a
two-year

01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
two-year
 
01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
um so there's got to be a balance
 
01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
between what I think was very very
 
01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:24.950 align:start position:0%
between what I think was very very
narrow

01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
um in that prior study because you get
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
together with Jim and Barrett and others
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
that are involved with this and try to
 
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
drop a list of bullets that we might
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
want to consider as a body here sure
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yes Dave thanks Rick
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
um and um you know I think also the the
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
components that go into articles of
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:56.689 --> 01:45:56.699 align:start position:0%
completely laid out and then with and I
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
and I liked um
 
01:46:02.450 --> 01:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
um Jim o'shaughnessy's uh language with
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a light touch to the to
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
the definition and and um and you know
 
01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
characteristics of uh for each of those
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
points going back to going back a
 
01:46:16.490 --> 01:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
million years to my Commerce phase we
 
01:46:19.729 --> 01:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
did some similar things in condo law uh
 
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
where condo and I you know two very
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
different things here but condo
 
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
agreements were all over the place and
 
01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and uh chair hunt
 
01:46:32.689 --> 01:46:32.699 align:start position:0%
um really did you know with a with I
 
01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
think a fairly light touch provides
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
provide I had a light touch I had a
 
01:46:40.129 --> 01:46:40.139 align:start position:0%
light well you know John you know and
 
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
and and and it does fall into the you
 
01:46:46.129 --> 01:46:46.139 align:start position:0%
know contracts uh position but um but
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
but to but to put some sort of framework
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
and some blueprint as as Patty calls it
 
01:46:54.169 --> 01:46:54.179 align:start position:0%
to um you know to these things you know
 
01:46:57.169 --> 01:46:57.179 align:start position:0%
I think we've got a we've got a um
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
um you know a record of being able to do
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
things like this so I I think what
 
01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
you're all suggesting is terrific and I
 
01:47:06.169 --> 01:47:06.179 align:start position:0%
think at this point you know the 2017
 
01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
study commission to the rest of my
 
01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
recollection there's been an enormous
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
focus on the history of cooperatives
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
kind of the question of how did we get
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
here and I think those those questions
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
have been answered I think there's been
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion about that and I
 
01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
think it's been most appreciative
 
01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:23.780 align:start position:0%
um and appreciated rather
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
to understand the how did we get here
 
01:47:28.370 --> 01:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
and now I think as as a legislative
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
committee as a group of citizens we're
 
01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
ready for the next logical step which is
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
where do we go from here and so I think
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
that's where the study committee can
 
01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
kind of pivot a little bit in its work
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
to the broader understanding of so now
 
01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
what how do we how do we work with what
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
we have we understand how it got formed
 
01:47:49.609 --> 01:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
and now we need to to Pivot a little bit
 
01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
in our analysis
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
we've heard that some districts may not
 
01:47:55.129 --> 01:47:55.139 align:start position:0%
have articles of agreement if they are
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
formed Freer prior to should they all
 
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:09.890 --> 01:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe if so so well I think well
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's a question maybe we have to ask
 
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
and that's that's our decision here but
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
um I representative Ladd I think we all
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
need to take a moment to recognize you
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
asked a question that um stumped two
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
lawyers not just one so that's very good
 
01:48:24.770 --> 01:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
again Ask two lawyers I'll get three
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
answers exactly
 
01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:30.179 align:start position:0%
it depends
 
01:48:30.179 --> 01:48:31.270 align:start position:0%
it depends
um

01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
so I I but that is that is one of the
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
considerations is there has to be a
 
01:48:39.290 --> 01:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
recognition that there are properties
 
01:48:41.629 --> 01:48:41.639 align:start position:0%
formed before the statute was created
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
and how will they be affected by it
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
um and I know I worked with Senator
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
Reagan on creating a a bill from the
 
01:48:51.609 --> 01:48:51.619 align:start position:0%
2017 commission that was
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
recognized that difference and so I
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
think we put in a time frame on that
 
01:48:58.729 --> 01:48:58.739 align:start position:0%
um moving forward so these are all
 
01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
things considerations for the study
 
01:49:02.689 --> 01:49:02.699 align:start position:0%
commission to think about
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh further
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
questions for our attorneys here well I
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
I just I think we had another answer I
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
actually had another question answer to
 
01:49:13.970 --> 01:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
her question I think that you want to
 
01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
make sure you've got some Educators at
 
01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
the table
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
um because in many of the discussions
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
that um I've heard
 
01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
um maybe in my
 
01:49:25.070 --> 01:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
non-legal capacity
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
um it's become a math question
 
01:49:30.050 --> 01:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
um whether we should continue in a co-op
 
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
versus an education question it is a
 
01:49:35.450 --> 01:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
comprehensive question and we always
 
01:49:38.330 --> 01:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
have to keep it in the context of it is
 
01:49:40.729 --> 01:49:40.739 align:start position:0%
a school and we're trying to educate
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
kids so we definitely want to make sure
 
01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
that we're including Educators in that
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
conversation and what types of courses
 
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
rigor and curriculum can we offer in a
 
01:49:55.609 --> 01:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
in a co-op versus individual districts
 
01:49:58.010 --> 01:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
and that at least be part of the factors
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
that are considered in that conversation
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
so we don't get too wrapped up in dra
 
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
good formulas and you know property
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
values that we also remember this is an
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
education bill
 
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
so so Rick if I may in summary then
 
01:50:18.169 --> 01:50:18.179 align:start position:0%
are we asking the attorneys present here
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
and I would also add perhaps a
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent or two
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
to get together and come back to this
 
01:50:26.639 --> 01:50:27.590 align:start position:0%
to get together and come back to this
group

01:50:27.590 --> 01:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
with some recommendations on what that
 
01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.250 align:start position:0%
with some recommendations on what that
Commission

01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
task might be as well as the composition
 
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
a person of individual types to be on
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
that commission is that what is that
 
01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
what we're asking we'll take all the
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
input from them and we can get but
 
01:50:47.209 --> 01:50:47.219 align:start position:0%
however when it comes down to the basic
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
policies like you know if policy people
 
01:50:51.410 --> 01:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
on there we'll make those decisions I
 
01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
understand that but uh I think yes we
 
01:50:56.450 --> 01:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
are asking them you know what what are
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
some of the charges the duties that this
 
01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
group needs to cover if it's too broad
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
we probably won't get anywhere but if
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to nail down what we've
 
01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
discussed here today
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
um I'd welcome their their input on
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
membership and what those charges should
 
01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
be and I think that's the what that's
 
01:51:16.609 --> 01:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
the first step to trying to tackle this
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
thing in a way that perhaps we haven't
 
01:51:20.810 --> 01:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
tackled it in the in the past and we we
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
would be happy to do that we'll see by
 
01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
that I know the legislature is getting
 
01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
tired of having so many committees and
 
01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
commissions so I can't even identify the
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
number that I'm on and it's you know you
 
01:51:33.649 --> 01:51:33.659 align:start position:0%
wonder are we really achieving anything
 
01:51:36.050 --> 01:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
I think we can achieve something with
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
this if it's done properly the because
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
there is and we hear that maybe
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
one-third of our folks out there in
 
01:51:46.010 --> 01:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
co-ops may have issues one way or
 
01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:46.930 align:start position:0%
co-ops may have issues one way or
another

01:51:46.930 --> 01:51:46.940 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
well that's that's a number which I
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
think's high and you know and we we got
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
to resolve that and that's if we're
 
01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
going to do something this might be the
 
01:51:58.729 --> 01:51:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:02.030 --> 01:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:03.649 --> 01:52:03.659 align:start position:0%
I'm not missing it thank you very much
 
01:52:06.129 --> 01:52:06.139 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anybody else today
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
superintendents from the education
 
01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
policy side anything like that uh
 
01:52:13.010 --> 01:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
anything to present or just make us
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:26.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:52:26.590 --> 01:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.590 --> 01:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
ERS I'm the superintendent of conval
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to pay back on
 
01:52:36.109 --> 01:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
something attorney Brown said and that
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
is that this sounds and it's beginning
 
01:52:42.410 --> 01:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
to feel like it's a math problem but the
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
truth is is that the Cooperative school
 
01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:47.450 align:start position:0%
truth is is that the Cooperative school
districts

01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
work under Articles of agreement most of
 
01:52:49.739 --> 01:52:50.810 align:start position:0%
work under Articles of agreement most of
them

01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:50.820 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
um our articles agreement and combound
 
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
have to be reviewed every three years
 
01:52:58.850 --> 01:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
our articles of agreement in kanbal
 
01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
include a representative Committee of
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
all the Selectmen of the towns
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
so there are articles of agreement
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
that represent what I think you might be
 
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
but more important than that is any
 
01:53:18.649 --> 01:53:18.659 align:start position:0%
commission or any study that the
 
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
legislature decides to do should also
 
01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:23.090 align:start position:0%
legislature decides to do should also
include

01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
the softer side if you will which I know
 
01:53:27.649 --> 01:53:27.659 align:start position:0%
for some of you is very hard to talk
 
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
about and that is that at the end of the
 
01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:32.270 align:start position:0%
about and that is that at the end of the
day

01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:33.950 align:start position:0%
day
each

01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
each
 
01:53:37.149 --> 01:53:37.159 align:start position:0%
Co-op also has an identity
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
in 55 the 55 years of the conval
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
Co-op has been together that people in
 
01:53:47.689 --> 01:53:47.699 align:start position:0%
our towns in the nine towns that we
 
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
serve identify themselves as belonging
 
01:53:52.609 --> 01:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
to the conval
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
School District
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
that happens because many a particularly
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
larger co-ops become the state in
 
01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:01.550 align:start position:0%
larger co-ops become the state in
miniature

01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
miniature
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
they become miniature municipalities
 
01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
and people identify as from that area
 
01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
where are you from I'm from the conval
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
not all co-ops I just I think this was
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
misspoken not all co-ops have multiple
 
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
districts some co-ops are simply one
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
District like the Kentucky Valley School
 
01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:25.910 align:start position:0%
District like the Kentucky Valley School
District

01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
um so I was a little confused I think I
 
01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if someone misspoke they were
 
01:54:34.330 --> 01:54:34.340 align:start position:0%
built on cost sharing they're built on
 
01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
providing the best education to students
 
01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
the best resources to students and
 
01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
they're built on local control
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
and that's important to those miniature
 
01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
states that they are allowed to control
 
01:54:54.410 --> 01:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
their destinies
 
01:54:58.129 --> 01:54:58.139 align:start position:0%
so as you're considering a commission
 
01:55:01.609 --> 01:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
you should also remember that
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
you are entering into an area where many
 
01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
of these towns
 
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
have had 55 years of local control over
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
their Cooperative School District
 
01:55:18.770 --> 01:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
and many of them have agreements a
 
01:55:21.410 --> 01:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
browned dissolution
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
for instance in our Cooperative District
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
we have one town that should the
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
building no longer be used for
 
01:55:31.729 --> 01:55:31.739 align:start position:0%
educational purposes it gets returned to
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
the town
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
we have another agreement with a
 
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
different town
 
01:55:37.970 --> 01:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
they own the property but we own the
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
building sounds like a condo doesn't it
 
01:55:45.530 --> 01:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
so please be aware as you begin to look
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
and and pull back the layers of the
 
01:55:48.719 --> 01:55:49.850 align:start position:0%
and and pull back the layers of the
onion

01:55:49.850 --> 01:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
onion
 
01:55:52.729 --> 01:55:52.739 align:start position:0%
that there are multiple types of
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
agreements there are multiple types of
 
01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:57.229 align:start position:0%
agreements there are multiple types of
co-ops

01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
co-ops
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
and while every Co-op is a little
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
different of course they have
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
similarities many of our co-ops if you
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
look carefully about where they are
 
01:56:11.330 --> 01:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
have been designed because of their
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
rural locations
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
so if you do create a commission I would
 
01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
highly encourage you to consider having
 
01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
somebody on there that understands rural
 
01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
communities that understands is an
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
expert in rural education because it is
 
01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
different than Urban education and
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
understands rural economics
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
because they're rural poor are different
 
01:56:41.450 --> 01:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
than the urban poor and the Suburban
 
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
poor finally I want to just follow
 
01:56:46.970 --> 01:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
through on a narrative that has
 
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
continued through each of these
 
01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:51.830 align:start position:0%
continued through each of these
um

01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
test of testimonies and that's the the
 
01:56:58.010 --> 01:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
idea that a co-op is a marriage
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
certainly there are all types of
 
01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
marriages and when you're hanging out
 
01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:03.659 align:start position:0%
with your friends you may complain about
 
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
your marriage
 
01:57:06.770 --> 01:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean you don't want to be
 
01:57:07.850 --> 01:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
in it
 
01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that and at the base of
 
01:57:13.070 --> 01:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
it there are problems
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
although I'd like to see a marriage that
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't have them
 
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
and it's certainly I don't think anyone
 
01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
would say gosh marriage has its problems
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.790 --> 01:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
all right thank you my colleague is uh
 
01:57:35.089 --> 01:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
very bold and wanting to speak first I
 
01:57:37.070 --> 01:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
hesitate to try and follow that up so
 
01:57:38.930 --> 01:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you secondly I also stand between
 
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
you and I believe lunch so books being a
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
precarious position to begin uh my name
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
is David Ryan I'm superintendent in
 
01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
sau16 representing six towns there's a
 
01:57:50.270 --> 01:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
difference between an SAU as you know
 
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
and a Cooperative School District
 
01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
the Exeter region Cooperative School
 
01:57:57.290 --> 01:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
District was formed in 1996
 
01:57:59.930 --> 01:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
also that the six towns could send their
 
01:58:01.250 --> 01:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
students coming from their local
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
elementary schools
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
to high achieving High achieving middle
 
01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
school and a high achieving High School
 
01:58:09.649 --> 01:58:09.659 align:start position:0%
they've been working under an area
 
01:58:11.810 --> 01:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
agreement which as you know has limited
 
01:58:13.850 --> 01:58:13.860 align:start position:0%
governing ability for the legislative
 
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
body of each of those towns submitting
 
01:58:18.410 --> 01:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
students to those schools budgets are
 
01:58:20.930 --> 01:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
typically set by the local board
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
tuitions are set and those tuitions are
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
then paid having worked also in SAU 53
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
we experienced that uh one year
 
01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.070 align:start position:0%
we experienced that uh one year
particularly

01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
where our Pembroke voters and our
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
Allentown Epsom and Chichester voters
 
01:58:37.609 --> 01:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
along with the voters of Deerfield
 
01:58:39.530 --> 01:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
differed on what the costs were going to
 
01:58:43.370 --> 01:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
be for tuition at Pembroke Academy
 
01:58:45.649 --> 01:58:45.659 align:start position:0%
we don't experience that now as a
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District
 
01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
so the Middle School The Cooperative
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
Middle School was built in 1998 and then
 
01:58:55.609 --> 01:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
the high school followed with 2004.
 
01:58:57.290 --> 01:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Middle School is in the town
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
of Stratham
 
01:59:01.609 --> 01:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
the high school is in the town of extra
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
so the issue of dissolution becomes even
 
01:59:06.109 --> 01:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
more problematic with the transfer of a
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
building should there be a dissolution
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
of two Cooperative buildings built in
 
01:59:13.729 --> 01:59:13.739 align:start position:0%
the spirit of sharing costs and
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
achieving higher levels of rigor for all
 
01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:16.490 align:start position:0%
achieving higher levels of rigor for all
students

01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:59:18.169 --> 01:59:18.179 align:start position:0%
so that's a question in my mind and I'm
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
going to make my attempt to stay in my
 
01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
Lane as representing just SAU 16 but I
 
01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
share my colleagues concern for those
 
01:59:26.450 --> 01:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
north of this city
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
and the representation that they have or
 
01:59:31.370 --> 01:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
have not and the uh the obstacles that
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
they face in the North country
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh and try and educate students at high
 
01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:36.890 align:start position:0%
uh and try and educate students at high
levels

01:59:36.890 --> 01:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
levels
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
I'm fortunate right now to be working on
 
01:59:41.450 --> 01:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
the task force for minimum academic
 
01:59:44.089 --> 01:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
standards and in that task force we've
 
01:59:45.290 --> 01:59:45.300 align:start position:0%
been working through a framework of
 
01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
equity to ensure that all students are
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
achieving at high levels and that we
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
have policy that surrounds
 
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
those outcomes for all kids leaving it
 
01:59:56.209 --> 01:59:56.219 align:start position:0%
to local school districts to make the
 
01:59:58.129 --> 01:59:58.139 align:start position:0%
decision and choices
 
02:00:00.649 --> 02:00:00.659 align:start position:0%
on how students achieve those high
 
02:00:00.659 --> 02:00:01.729 align:start position:0%
on how students achieve those high
levels

02:00:01.729 --> 02:00:01.739 align:start position:0%
levels
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
so local control remains strong but as a
 
02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
state trying to enact policy
 
02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
that make sure that every single student
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
has the same opportunities
 
02:00:13.250 --> 02:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
for high level outcomes some may not get
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
there not all will get there but they'll
 
02:00:17.089 --> 02:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
all have the same opportunity and
 
02:00:17.099 --> 02:00:19.010 align:start position:0%
all have the same opportunity and
expectations

02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
expectations
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
we believe our Cooperative School
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
District does the same thing in the
 
02:00:25.070 --> 02:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
Seacoast region
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the town of Brentwood we have a K-5
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
school as we do in four of our other
 
02:00:32.450 --> 02:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
Five Towns the town of Exeter we have
 
02:00:34.490 --> 02:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
two elementary schools a k to two and a
 
02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
three to five
 
02:00:37.250 --> 02:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
all knowing that they're going to be
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
moving on together to Cooperative Middle
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
School for those who choose to move on
 
02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
to Cooperative Middle School in the
 
02:00:45.169 --> 02:00:45.179 align:start position:0%
event that we were to eliminate either
 
02:00:46.609 --> 02:00:46.619 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative Middle School and or
 
02:00:48.770 --> 02:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
Exeter High School each of those
 
02:00:50.810 --> 02:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
districts would still then be able they
 
02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
required to educate their students at
 
02:00:53.930 --> 02:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
the secondary level
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
and as the superintendent who provides
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
the services under the SAU for those six
 
02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
communities we would be forced to
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
negotiate tuition agreements
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
for all secondary services
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
some of the issues and this goes back to
 
02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative myler's question thank
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
you with regard to cost
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
is we work through a transportation
 
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
budget that requires us to have a double
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
run of our buses in order to adequately
 
02:01:21.410 --> 02:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
afford this expansive square footage or
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
square mileage of our communities to get
 
02:01:25.850 --> 02:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
kids to school on time
 
02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
in the event that we're not able to
 
02:01:29.450 --> 02:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
provide that because the dissolution of
 
02:01:31.370 --> 02:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative takes place
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
we're now required to negotiate
 
02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
individual Transportation contracts with
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
each of our six communities
 
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
and keep in mind it would not all be
 
02:01:42.649 --> 02:01:42.659 align:start position:0%
going to the same destination
 
02:01:44.209 --> 02:01:44.219 align:start position:0%
there's Epping High School there's
 
02:01:45.770 --> 02:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
Sanborn there would certainly still be
 
02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:47.570 align:start position:0%
Sanborn there would certainly still be
Exeter

02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
Exeter
 
02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
there could be Dover there could be
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
whatever the tuition agreements that
 
02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
these communities want to come up with
 
02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
as a resident of Hooksett
 
02:01:57.770 --> 02:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
in SAU 15 my own children have attended
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester High School so my last one
 
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
will attend and graduate from Central
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
High School this year
 
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
not all students in the town of Hooksett
 
02:02:09.050 --> 02:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
are going to Manchester as you know they
 
02:02:10.669 --> 02:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
had a tuition agreement as well we had
 
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
no say in the budget
 
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
we had no say in representation on the
 
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
boards and so the decisions that were
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
being made in the city of Manchester
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
were those decisions that were passed on
 
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
to the sending towns Bedford spoke with
 
02:02:26.209 --> 02:02:26.219 align:start position:0%
their feet
 
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
so in in in the Seacoast region where we
 
02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
have a strong Cooperative School
 
02:02:33.649 --> 02:02:33.659 align:start position:0%
District that was built specifically to
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
provide all of our students in our six
 
02:02:38.089 --> 02:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
towns with a high level academic
 
02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
experience and be able to offer all of
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
the programming that we believe they
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
need to be successful
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking about advanced placement
 
02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:46.669 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking about advanced placement
course

02:02:46.669 --> 02:02:46.679 align:start position:0%
course
 
02:02:48.830 --> 02:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh other dual enrollment courses working
 
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
with area colleges opportunities for the
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
music and arts for athletics we have to
 
02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:57.179 align:start position:0%
pool our resources and that's what they
 
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
decided to do back prior to 1996 when
 
02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
they worked to form a Cooperative school
 
02:03:04.609 --> 02:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
district there are a couple of points
 
02:03:07.250 --> 02:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make my idea of uh or
 
02:03:09.770 --> 02:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
my thoughts about a commission are are
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
quite positive and in that we were
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
um I can't recall if it was
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
representative Miler or luna or lad that
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
suggested a couple of superintendents be
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
a part of that commission I would be
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
more than willing to volunteer to be a
 
02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:23.639 align:start position:0%
part of that group
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I think we would
 
02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
need to address however are all
 
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
governing structures because I'm not
 
02:03:30.050 --> 02:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
certain that all of the members of our
 
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
02:03:33.709 --> 02:03:33.719 align:start position:0%
understand the difference between a
 
02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
an area agreement or other forms of
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
governance because what happens with
 
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
voters is when they're told their vote
 
02:03:44.810 --> 02:03:44.820 align:start position:0%
no longer counts I think they get fairly
 
02:03:47.689 --> 02:03:47.699 align:start position:0%
upset and should people wish to secede
 
02:03:49.729 --> 02:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
from a Cooperative school district and
 
02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
recognize that they no longer have
 
02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
representation on the school board
 
02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
of a school to which they're sending
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
their children I'm not certain that they
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
would be very happy with that I think
 
02:04:00.530 --> 02:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
people don't understand
 
02:04:02.689 --> 02:04:02.699 align:start position:0%
so a commission I think has a duty to
 
02:04:02.699 --> 02:04:04.189 align:start position:0%
so a commission I think has a duty to
educate

02:04:04.189 --> 02:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
educate
 
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
its voters as well so people can
 
02:04:07.550 --> 02:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
understand what it is that they would be
 
02:04:11.450 --> 02:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:13.550 --> 02:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
the loss of control the loss of the seat
 
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
on the board the development of a budget
 
02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
the ability to vote for a budget that
 
02:04:18.890 --> 02:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
weighs heavy on me for the folks that I
 
02:04:21.050 --> 02:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
represent the families I represent not
 
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
just the families whose children attend
 
02:04:25.550 --> 02:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
our schools but for the close to 80
 
02:04:27.050 --> 02:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
percent of the families who live in our
 
02:04:29.390 --> 02:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
six towns who don't have children in our
 
02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:30.830 align:start position:0%
six towns who don't have children in our
schools

02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:04:35.149 --> 02:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
their tax dollars all fund our schools
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
and if they were then to be informed
 
02:04:38.810 --> 02:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
that their tax dollars were going
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere that they didn't have a say in
 
02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's a large body of people that I
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
don't want to have to face
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
the last thing I would like to ask is
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
that uh the the Genesis of these these
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
bills particularly those to dissolve um
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
The Cooperative my question to the
 
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
committee one thing I'd ask that you
 
02:04:59.810 --> 02:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
remember is this is a is this a question
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
of constitutionality
 
02:05:04.850 --> 02:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
are there things inherently wrong in the
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
law regarding Cooperative school
 
02:05:06.239 --> 02:05:07.490 align:start position:0%
law regarding Cooperative school
districts

02:05:07.490 --> 02:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:05:10.129 --> 02:05:10.139 align:start position:0%
or is this a question of
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
wanting to provide other choices and
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people in towns to do
 
02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
what they want to do with regard to
 
02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:19.010 align:start position:0%
what they want to do with regard to
education

02:05:19.010 --> 02:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
in either case
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
there are going to be consequences and
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
ramifications for both
 
02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to leave with you is an
 
02:05:28.570 --> 02:05:28.580 align:start position:0%
sau16 our Cooperative School District
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
operates very well
 
02:05:32.930 --> 02:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
and as my colleagues have shared before
 
02:05:35.450 --> 02:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
there are folks including members of
 
02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
this committee who might have some
 
02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
differences of opinion on how it should
 
02:05:42.189 --> 02:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
work but we do have a democratic process
 
02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
that we follow every year to determine
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's going the best that
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
it can and we always do that with a
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
focus on what's best for our kids
 
02:05:54.169 --> 02:05:54.179 align:start position:0%
I think thank you very much I'd be happy
 
02:05:55.790 --> 02:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions any questions
 
02:05:58.250 --> 02:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
for these superintendents
 
02:06:00.169 --> 02:06:00.179 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much both of
 
02:06:02.450 --> 02:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
02:06:05.629 --> 02:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
so with that we are you know at an hour
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
where we're I think we are ready to
 
02:06:10.250 --> 02:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
adjourn this meeting however we need to
 
02:06:13.070 --> 02:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
set a meeting one more meeting here in
 
02:06:17.149 --> 02:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
which we will develop a recommendation
 
02:06:19.609 --> 02:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
to make to the whole and hopefully we
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
will have that some of that feedback
 
02:06:23.689 --> 02:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
back from folks here as to if we go the
 
02:06:26.330 --> 02:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
route of a commission then we'd have
 
02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
that and I asked everybody on the
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
committee here it'd be also thinking
 
02:06:33.649 --> 02:06:33.659 align:start position:0%
about you know you know charges that
 
02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
might be given to a commission study
 
02:06:40.250 --> 02:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank everybody who took
 
02:06:42.109 --> 02:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
the time to come away from your busy
 
02:06:44.089 --> 02:06:44.099 align:start position:0%
schedules today for this this is a topic
 
02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty heady and and speak to the
 
02:06:51.169 --> 02:06:51.179 align:start position:0%
you know the the the need uh for for
 
02:06:54.050 --> 02:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
this in school building Aid we have a
 
02:06:57.950 --> 02:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
condition called consolidation uh to to
 
02:07:01.010 --> 02:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're not splitting up in in
 
02:07:04.189 --> 02:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
having buildings we try to consolidate
 
02:07:07.250 --> 02:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
students into one facility and that will
 
02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
in the application process that will
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
give you additional dollars uh the
 
02:07:14.689 --> 02:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
efficiency of the dollar efficiency in
 
02:07:17.290 --> 02:07:17.300 align:start position:0%
in of the educational practices as well
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh putting People Under One Roof in in
 
02:07:23.209 --> 02:07:23.219 align:start position:0%
from multiple locations so uh we
 
02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
understand and uh I think that the
 
02:07:27.470 --> 02:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation this group comes up what
 
02:07:29.450 --> 02:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
is going to be a good one and hopefully
 
02:07:32.930 --> 02:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
lead to some resolve on this this issue
 
02:07:35.450 --> 02:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
has plagued us myself for the last 14
 
02:07:37.490 --> 02:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
years and I know for many many others
 
02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
