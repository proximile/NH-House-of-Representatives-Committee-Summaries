hold questions until the end any
 
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.130 align:start position:0%

questions
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey can you tell me um
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of things
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
um the arbor funds were allowed to be
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
used for in the fish and game department
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
well we had uh several pots that came in
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
for the fish and game department we
 
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.049 align:start position:0%
for the fish and game department we
purchased

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
purchased
 
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
um some critical equipment for law
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement including a couple of boats
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
I believe Colonel yep
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
and we paid for some computers
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
we also were issued but have not
 
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
received yet a 55 million dollar Arbor
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
allotment for a very large Hatchery
 
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.930 align:start position:0%
allotment for a very large Hatchery
project

00:18:59.930 --> 00:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:03.539 align:start position:0%
um we received two pots of arpa funding
 
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
through Des which the funds went through
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
des and we are a sub-recipient of that
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
one of those pots was one million
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
dollars for a hatchery feasibility study
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
with which all of those funds were
 
00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:21.539 align:start position:0%
contracted out to a contractor to
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
provide a feasibility study on the
 
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
director could probably talk a little
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
better about that on what we can do with
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
our hatcheries and how we can better
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
maintain what we may do with those
 
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
hatcheries and the other funds are used
 
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
for alteration of terrain permits
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
because we hired four individuals
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
in-house and one of those individuals in
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
houses being funded through those Des
 
00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:54.299 align:start position:0%
funds the other three are being funded
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
directly from arpa funds that came
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
directly to us
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
so those are all the arpa funds that
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
came to us
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
both the database sorry 1.2 million
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
dollars came to us just recently for an
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
upgrade for our database
 
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
um overall agency database efficiency
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.179 --> 00:20:32.510 align:start position:0%
 
because

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Garrett
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
grasskamp I'm the boat access
 
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
coordinator for New Hampshire Fish and
 
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.690 align:start position:0%

Game
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
right now as Scott said we don't have a
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
facilities in lands Chief so I'll make a
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
few comments on that at the end but for
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
the moment I'll stick to what I know
 
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
which is the boat access program
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
the boat access program
 
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.210 align:start position:0%
the boat access program
um

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
started way back in the 1880s 1884 was
 
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
the first ramp that was laid out on
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
behalf for State access on
 
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.850 align:start position:0%
behalf for State access on
on

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
County pond in Newton and in 1945 a law
 
00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:18.059 align:start position:0%
RSA 230 was passed which initiated the
 
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
road to public water program
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
which ended up building about
 
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
96 sites which were very small
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
some of them half the size of this room
 
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
basically as the
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
the name says it's a road to public
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
water so built by dot you'd have a
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
right-of-way 50 feet wide and it would
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
go right to the edge of the water from
 
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
an existing Road
 
00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
those properties were turned over to the
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
town to be maintained and managed
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
but the property itself remained owned
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
by the the state
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh that bill was repealed in 1992 and
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
replaced with the current Statewide
 
00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
Public boat access program
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
and that's RSA 233-a
 
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
that also implemented the public water
 
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
access Advisory Board which I work
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
closely with to determine where we
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
should have more boat access and that's
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
been around since really in effect since
 
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:34.580 align:start position:0%
um as an aside we
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
were funded by five dollars for each
 
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
boat access sorry boat registration
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
and I'll go into that a little bit more
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
later but we do need more access sites
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
covid got in uh you know what really
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
highlighted the fact that we don't have
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
enough access to our Lakes the sites
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
that we had were
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
overrun with extra people wanting to use
 
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.470 align:start position:0%
overrun with extra people wanting to use
them

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
and it was very difficult to get
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
everybody access in a in a way that they
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
could be maximize their enjoyment
 
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh the objective of the program is to
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
acquire property and construct load
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
access sites
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
and then manage them after they are
 
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
built we have 135 sites currently of
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
which 77 are rant cap ramp capable for
 
00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:33.419 align:start position:0%
uh of handling a trailered boat a normal
 
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
size say 20 to 25 foot boat we have an
 
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.529 align:start position:0%
size say 20 to 25 foot boat we have an
additional

00:23:38.529 --> 00:23:38.539 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
58 sites that are for car top for your
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
kayaks and your canoes which are mostly
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
just gravel access points or a Shore
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
Bank where we could also do some fishing
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
program staff
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
the I'm a program specialist in the
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
hierarchy of names that the agencies
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
apply to the people who work for the
 
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
state I have a construction Foreman who
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
works directly for me who does our basic
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance on our sites for painting
 
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
kiosks building kiosks installing them
 
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
and during the summer we hire eight to
 
00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059 align:start position:0%
nine seasonal employees for a six six
 
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
month period and they go around to all
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
our sites
 
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
and pick up trash do the mowing keep
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
them presentable and safe for the public
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
that visits our sites
 
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
so in comparison to the rest of the
 
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
state just to put in perspective we we
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
manage 135 sites but they're probably
 
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
about four to five hundred additional
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
sites in the state that are managed by
 
00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
the town or a public utility or some
 
00:24:48.659 --> 00:24:49.789 align:start position:0%
the town or a public utility or some
other

00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:50.450 align:start position:0%
other
um

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.250 align:start position:0%
um
entity

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
entity
 
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
those sites are not Public Access sites
 
00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:00.299 align:start position:0%
the definition of a public access site
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
is one that's controlled by the state in
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
other words we either have a lease or a
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
fioned or an easement on the property
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
that has Shore front prop uh Shoreline
 
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
where we can control access
 
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.549 align:start position:0%
where we can control access
um

00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
the town sites the the puc sites the
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
utility sites although they provide
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
provide Public Access
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
they are not guaranteed Public Access
 
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.769 align:start position:0%
they are not guaranteed Public Access
because

00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
they can change their mind that entity
 
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
can say no I'm not going to have it open
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
to the public anymore and that happened
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
a few times when we had covid because
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
the towns in particular would say wow
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
our residents can't get on the property
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
because we have all these other people
 
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
that have shown up
 
00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.570 align:start position:0%
that have shown up
um

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
we just built a new site in the southern
 
00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
portion southern tip of Alton Bay
 
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
it's our first boat ramp on Lake
 
00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.950 align:start position:0%
it's our first boat ramp on Lake
Winnipesaukee

00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
it has 18
 
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:00.710 align:start position:0%
it has 18
um

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:03.059 align:start position:0%
ramp parking lots of sorry trailer
 
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
parking lots spots on it and that gets
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
filled up
 
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
by probably seven in the morning on a
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
weekend Into Summer
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
I went over there I'd live in Gilmanton
 
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
I said well I'm up at 6 30. I don't know
 
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
why I'm going to drive over and see if
 
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's full and guess what it was full so
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
we need more sites we need more the
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
ability to build more uh boat ramps and
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
we can't do that without property and so
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
most of our work in-house with that crew
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
we have two additional construction
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
um employees if you will in an
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
engineering Tech and another
 
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
construction Foreman
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
they and we have
 
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.810 align:start position:0%
they and we have
um

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
another person who works in the right on
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
site at Fish and Game
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
in Concord
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
and with those three people in my
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
construction Foreman
 
00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:09.059 align:start position:0%
and actually two other Carpenters so we
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
have about six people that have to
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
manage and I'm blending here into the
 
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
facilities and land information but we
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
maintain 160 buildings and
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
um about a hundred Dam sites although we
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
don't manage the dam sites in particular
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
but we will you know do the Mowing and
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
the maintenance there but if a major
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
repair has to happen then that goes out
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
to the dam Bureau at DES but six people
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
to do the work to maintain maintain 160
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
buildings plus six hatcheries
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
we basically are stretched lots of times
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
to get all this work done so that's
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
something that you should be aware of
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
um just a lot to be done it's a big a
 
00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:57.980 align:start position:0%
big effort a fish and game to maintain
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh access and and safe access for the
 
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.310 align:start position:0%
uh access and and safe access for the
public

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
we build our own sites lots of times we
 
00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
put in a turbidity curtain around the
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
ramp where we are going to be working to
 
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
keep the silt and and uh debris that we
 
00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
dig up from getting into the channel or
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
into the lake
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of our work in the past
 
00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:24.020 align:start position:0%
when the water's been shallow to put in
 
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
concrete planks which are a little bit
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
bigger than two of these desks going
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
down and we put those into the water to
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
create a pathway for the trailer to back
 
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.649 align:start position:0%
create a pathway for the trailer to back
into

00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
and we've been able to do that in-house
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
most of the time in the past 30 years or
 
00:28:39.659 --> 00:28:41.090 align:start position:0%
most of the time in the past 30 years or
so

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
things that we can't do like Paving or
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
train work we have to hire out
 
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
marking the pavement things like that
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
will hire that that out but anything
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we can build as as a Carpenters or
 
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
with earthwork we'll do that ourselves
 
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
we have a a full-size excavator that's
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
25 years old so we're
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
making that go we have two backhoes we
 
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
have two dump trucks and a bobcat and
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
that's the extent of our equipment that
 
00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
we're that we can bring to bear on our
 
00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:19.430 align:start position:0%
we're that we can bring to bear on our
projects

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
oh funding very important
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
um Federal funding I have a dedicated
 
00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059 align:start position:0%
account it's the sport fish restoration
 
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:33.260 align:start position:0%
act program that brings in about
 
00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:38.539 align:start position:0%
550 uh thousand dollars a year
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
we've been getting that for basically
 
00:29:45.649 --> 00:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
the entire time for that the program's
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
been in place since 1992. if you look at
 
00:29:50.529 --> 00:29:50.539 align:start position:0%
the cost of living
 
00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:54.059 align:start position:0%
index on that that money is actually
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
only worth about uh 400 sorry 290
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars with based on the
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor inflation factors
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
0.3.53 it's almost in half from what it
 
00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
was the other side of our program is uh
 
00:30:15.289 --> 00:30:15.299 align:start position:0%
funded by or the other funding mechanism
 
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
is the state uh boat access excise fee
 
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
of five dollars on every boat that's
 
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
registered in the state it's motorboats
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
only in sailboats kayaks and canoes are
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
not included in that so that five
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
dollars brings in about 460
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
000 a year but again the inflation
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
Factor brings that down to about 290
 
00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:40.490 align:start position:0%
Factor brings that down to about 290
dollars

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
so a thousand dollars so we basically
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
are operating on for about uh five
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
hundred to six hundred thousand dollars
 
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
a year which
 
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
that's nineteen ninety two dollars and
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
you can imagine that with prices on
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
on the Lakes going up it's very
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to ever be able to afford a
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
um I think I've talked enough and I'd
 
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
like to hear if you have any questions
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your
 
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
we've already forgotten the order so
 
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
that we're supposed to go in good
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Kevin Jordan
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm the chief of law enforcement at
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Fish and Game uh and I'm
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
entering my 32nd year uh in law
 
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.330 align:start position:0%
entering my 32nd year uh in law
enforcement

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
um which just says I don't really have a
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
life outside of law enforcement I guess
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
um so we have uh there are two things
 
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
I'm very passionate about and you'll
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
hear it you'll see me a lot over here in
 
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
front of the committee I testify a lot
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh there are two things I'm very
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
passionate about uh one is the mission
 
00:32:00.289 --> 00:32:00.299 align:start position:0%
of our agency I think it is a it is an
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
outstanding Mission I think we do a lot
 
00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:03.539 align:start position:0%
of good for the State of New Hampshire I
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
can show you and we'll show you that we
 
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
bring in a good deal of Revenue I
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
believe in the sport of hunting and
 
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
fishing when it's done correctly and you
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
will hear me testify in regards to that
 
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
I'm also very passionate about the men
 
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
and women that I work with that wear
 
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
this uniform and you'll hear that come
 
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
out on occasion as well so
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
um and I I don't want to make apologies
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
for either one of those things I think
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
they're both very important we have 42
 
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
full-time officers that's including me
 
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
38 of those are currently field
 
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
positions that cover every piece of
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
ground you see from this town of
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh to Massachusetts from Vermont
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
to Maine and it's not nearly enough
 
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
you'll hear that often they're stretched
 
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
pretty thin all of them are covering
 
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:48.020 align:start position:0%
five to six towns or or more each
 
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
running around putting out some of the
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
fires that we have the city of Concord
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
has over 50 officers just to give you an
 
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
idea we're covering the entire state
 
00:32:57.889 --> 00:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
with 38.
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
we joined we being the colonel major and
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
Captain go out on the weekends I ride an
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
ATV in the summertime with these guys
 
00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:06.059 align:start position:0%
because I figure if I ask them to ride
 
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
in the dirt and the heat I probably
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
should be joining them so that we all do
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
it as a as a team that also keeps you
 
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
relevant with the issues that they face
 
00:33:15.889 --> 00:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
and some of the equipment needs that
 
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
they have I understand it if I'm out
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
there working with them
 
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
we enforce all of hunting and fishing
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
and trapping regulations as you can
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
imagine uh do conduct all those
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
investigations uh involving Wildlife we
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't do anything with domestic animals
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
unless we're assisting a local police
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
department so we leave them to handle
 
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
that but we handled all the wildlife we
 
00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
handled all the nuisance wildlife animal
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
calls a majority of them we work in
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
conjunction with our Wildlife staff they
 
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
have a good team of of techs that help
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
us with bear complaints
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
um or some of these other bigger large
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
animal problems when you have a moose
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
show up in the city of Manchester we
 
00:33:59.810 --> 00:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
work as a team to to extract the moose
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
and and get it back out in the wild
 
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
we do all the rabies processing the
 
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
investigations for rabies calls and we
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
process the animals and transport them
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
to Health and Human Services for testing
 
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
we enforce all the ATV and ohrv laws so
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
we're Patrol on snow machines and ATVs
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
to enforce speed limits we investigate
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
all the accidents we do Trail
 
00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:24.500 align:start position:0%
enforcement registration
 
00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
we participate in all of the outdoor
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
education classes to include hunter
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
safety trapping safety trapping classes
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
oh HIV classes let's go fishing programs
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
and becoming an outdoors women's program
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
we do along with Marine Patrol we do the
 
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
Inland Fisheries enforcement even though
 
00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:45.659 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol is a separate entity we're
 
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
enforcing the laws on on boats on our
 
00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.190 align:start position:0%
enforcing the laws on on boats on our
waterways

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
waterways
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
we do Coastal marine fisheries
 
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
enforcement along our Coastline you're
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
going to hear a lot more about that in
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
the next hour we work in partnership
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
with the national marine fisheries and
 
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
the federal we work in both state and
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
federal waters and we're contracted by
 
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
the some of these Federal organizations
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
because they don't have enough people to
 
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
cover this area so that we're all there
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
this is a huge industry that brings a
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
good deal of money into the state of New
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so monitoring that is
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
critically important
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
we do all of the search and rescue
 
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
Statewide anything from Lost persons to
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
carryouts for injured hikers so this
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
includes walkaways or runaways basically
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
anything that occurs off our highways
 
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
become our responsibilities things like
 
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:32.339 align:start position:0%
plane crashes major flooding or weather
 
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
events and we play a very active role
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
over at the New Hampshire Emergency
 
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
Operations Center as the lead in the
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
state for search and rescue so we're
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
probably well known for that because
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's something that we get in the
 
00:35:46.609 --> 00:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
papers and on the news a lot for some of
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
these high profile searches it presents
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
all kinds of challenges for us both for
 
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
safety and funding it's never been
 
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
funded correctly you'll hear me over
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
here beating this table as your as the
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
chairman is nodding his head because
 
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
he's seen it many times
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
our Sportsmen and women pay for that and
 
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:05.339 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's fair so we'll
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
you'll we'll be here asking for your
 
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
assistance on occasion to find a better
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
way to fund that that is something that
 
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
is growing
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
um in great numbers the search and
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
rescue and it's becoming more and more
 
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
dangerous and it's using up a lot of our
 
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.390 align:start position:0%
dangerous and it's using up a lot of our
resources

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of specialty teams within
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
the agency so we had to create an
 
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
advanced search and rescue team because
 
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
these search and rescue missions were
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
were putting people in positions where
 
00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:32.099 align:start position:0%
they weren't trained or equipped for so
 
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
we outfitted a small team of 16 officers
 
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
and trained them to levels that the
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
other officers have not been trained to
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
to respond above tree line at this time
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
of year when it's 1670 below zero we
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
have the only dive team within the state
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
even though Channel 9 will give State
 
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
Police Credit for our dive team and is
 
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
not theirs it is ours so when you see a
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
dive team on Channel 9 that is New
 
00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:56.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish and Game
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
incredible team again a small group of
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
very brave individuals that dive in all
 
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
kinds of weather under the ice and in
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
the summer months we have an underwater
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
sonar and Camera team which all was
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
donated a lot of these fund a lot of the
 
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
funding for these specialty teams we
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
went out we didn't have the funding for
 
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
it so we went out and raised the money
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves or or applied for Grants and
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
the side scan sonar came to us from
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security and these guys have
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
taken it to a level that New Hampshire
 
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
has never seen we've solved three
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
two a double decade cases that were
 
00:37:34.609 --> 00:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
found people that had been missing for
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
over 20 years that other agencies had
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
worked on we were able to locate these
 
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
people for families which was pretty
 
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
cool using this side scan I've got a
 
00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:44.900 align:start position:0%
team of guys that are very good with it
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
and we use that in conjunction with our
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
drownings and and we're being called on
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
pretty regularly from State Police and
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
other agencies for these specialty
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
skills the colonels have all got
 
00:37:59.810 --> 00:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
together and we decided that we can
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
fight over who takes the credit and the
 
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
Press when it's over but why don't we
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
pool our resources together and find
 
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
these people and bring them home to
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
their families if you've got a
 
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
helicopter and I've got a side scan
 
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
sonar we ought to be able to get it done
 
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
we've had great success with that so
 
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
um we have an airboat rescue team we
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
just recently received a 200 000 airboat
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
free of charge to the state of New
 
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that came out of a Homeland
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
Security Grant an airboat enables us
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a much safer craft to go on
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
thin ice we can run it across the
 
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
parking lot if we had to uh we have two
 
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
of those now we have an old one that I
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
keep fixing uh that we're going to keep
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
using and then we have a brand new one
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
that is state of the art so we're we're
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
just getting that off off the ground and
 
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
using that we have a four member now
 
00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339 align:start position:0%
canine team that is trained equipped uh
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
and we maintain solely through donations
 
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
there isn't a state dollar in the
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
canines and they are the best in the
 
00:38:58.609 --> 00:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
state and I will and I'm not the only
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
one who's going to tell you that you're
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
going to see our dogs used in homicides
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
there you because they're trained in one
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh subject and that is tracking locating
 
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
evidence and tracking and just like us
 
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
if you if you concentrate on one thing
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
you become very good at it where a lot
 
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
of police dogs are bite dogs they're
 
00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
tracking dogs they're drug dogs our dogs
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
are just trained in Scent recovery uh
 
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
and they're very good at it so again
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
they've been involved in in recently the
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
high profile cases that my dogs found
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
the evidence in was the Concord
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
homicides those guns and cartridges were
 
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
found by our dogs by Fish and Game dogs
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
and the homicide up in Northfield the
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
tragedy of the young man who killed his
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
mom his stepmom and his children and he
 
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
dumped his firearm out on the interstate
 
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
some eight miles from the homicide with
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
the scene in the homicide and our dog
 
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
running literally down the middle of the
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
highway with a with an officer on a
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
leash found that weapon and and because
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
of that the individual was arrested and
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
charged so we're proud of those dogs if
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
you haven't figured that out
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
and the state of New Hampshire gets
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
great service for no cost from that so
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
we have four of those I'm looking to
 
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
expand that we've also ran a pretty
 
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
successful little television show for
 
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
about 12 Seasons if you haven't seen
 
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
northwood's law I would encourage you to
 
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
watch it a lot of the reruns are on you
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
won't see this face this is a radio face
 
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
not a television face but there are a
 
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
lot of our officers that were on that
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
and the neat thing about that show it'll
 
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
give you some real insight in their
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
day-to-day activities and some of the
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
challenges that they face in some of the
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
issues they deal with so that's still
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
running what they're not currently
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
filming now which I'm I'm kind of happy
 
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
about is a lot of work but the show was
 
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
still being aired so I'd encourage you
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
to go see that it'll give you a lot of
 
00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
insight to the agency and all parts of
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
the agency so
 
00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:46.619 align:start position:0%
I don't want to take up any more of your
 
00:40:46.619 --> 00:40:48.950 align:start position:0%
I don't want to take up any more of your
time

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions from
 
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.170 align:start position:0%
the committee
representative

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
thank you chair just to make sure I
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
understand sure you have roughly 38
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
officers those 38 are divided into your
 
00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
dive sonar K9 all of these other things
 
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
Specialties yes wow okay thank you yeah
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
they're a very hard working Bunch yeah
 
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you you look
 
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
familiar to me I'll figure out why you
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
do what you look I think we've met
 
00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.710 align:start position:0%
do what you look I think we've met
probably

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
are you not using drones as of yet we
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
are actually that's a good question we
 
00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:29.579 align:start position:0%
recently got a grant for an 80 000 drone
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
and it's on order I have a young officer
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh this newer generation is much more
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
tech savvy than I've ever been and this
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
young man is pretty good with these
 
00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
things I made him prove it uh show me
 
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
that he could operate one and we could
 
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
do that safely and so we are looking to
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
do that to use it as a more of a search
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
and rescue tool I'm concerned about
 
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
privacy issues using it in
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
investigations and flying over people's
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
residents so I don't see it being used
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
there I I see it more as a resource for
 
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
our search missions so we're looking in
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
that direction
 
00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:05.579 align:start position:0%
so we are we are barely getting into
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
that now
 
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.630 align:start position:0%
that now
yeah

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to say
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much one of the victims
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
that you found in the Androscoggin river
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
I knew when I knew his family very well
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say thank you I
 
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
appreciate your hard work and your
 
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
dedication to find this man after
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
decades thank you very much I'll tell
 
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
you a quick story just to give you an
 
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
idea of the dedication of my staff so
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
they found that individual this was a
 
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
young man who had left a horseshoe
 
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
tournament if I remember right some 20
 
00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
years ago I remember searching for him
 
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
and when I was in the field and we never
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
found him and he literally drove off a
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
turn into the Androscoggin river and
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
submerged and there was never a skid
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
mark we drove up and down the river
 
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
looking for skid marks or tracks and we
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
never saw where he went when he was
 
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
located using his side scan he was
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
actually sitting in the front seat
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel as he was 20 years ago
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
when he went in there the sad part was
 
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
his mom had passed and she never knew we
 
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
found him which which was sad but uh the
 
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
leader of my team was contacted right
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
after that and told about a woman in
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
1973 who had gone missing in the town of
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
Gorham driving a Pontiac Le Mans so you
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
didn't know what a Le Mans was
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
and he quietly began researching this
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
case and so when the team was practicing
 
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
and using the side scan he would move it
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
and run these tests in places that he
 
00:43:26.089 --> 00:43:26.099 align:start position:0%
thought might be where this car would be
 
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
he discovers in his research a year
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
later so he does this for a year without
 
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
saying a word I had no knowledge they
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
were doing this a year later he
 
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
discovers this woman had had a daughter
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
in Gilman Vermont and so he thought
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
about the Connecticut River so he moved
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
his training over to the Connecticut
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
River one night I got a text I got a
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
call from him kind of a panic call he's
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
a young his name is Joe Canfield he's a
 
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
good he's a good officer and he called
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
me he says Colonel I'm going to send you
 
00:43:53.809 --> 00:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
because I'm a car guy I have hot rods I
 
00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
that was my former life he said I'm
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
going to send you a picture of a car I
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
think it's a Pontiac Le Mans can you
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
tell me if it's a Pontiac LeMans and he
 
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
sent me a text picture of a side scan
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
sonar of a Pontiac LeMans sitting upside
 
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
down in the Connecticut River I said
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
that's Pontiac LeMans Joe he said I
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
can't read the plate but I think it's
 
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
her this was a woman Mrs Lehman who had
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
gone Miss in 1973 I said we're going to
 
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
keep this between us for now and
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we'll send the dive team up
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
there and we'll grab that plate and if
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
in fact that's our plate we'll determine
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
if she's in that car and then we'll let
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
the press and and go get the family
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
because it was important for me to I
 
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to find the family first so we
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
went back over there and sure enough it
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
was Mrs Lehman and she was in the car so
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
we went down the road to find this poor
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
woman the daughter and her aunt was
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
there 80 year old woman and we walked in
 
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
and I had two stars from the Northwest
 
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
law program that are on my side scan she
 
00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:47.099 align:start position:0%
thought we were bringing the Stars to
 
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
the show to meet her aren't because she
 
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
loved the show so we let that go for a
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
few minutes and then we sat them down
 
00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
and I said I think I found you we found
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
your mother up the road she'd been there
 
00:44:59.210 --> 00:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
that whole time and this poor woman had
 
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
flown to Nevada she'd gone to Colorado
 
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
you know following leads and her mom was
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
up the road less than a mile for 20
 
00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:08.339 align:start position:0%
years so there was some real
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
satisfaction to finding these people and
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
bringing resolve to these cases so I was
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
was very proud of Joe and his team for
 
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:20.900 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you representative pair
 
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
I've also also watched a few episodes of
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
Northwoods is there any income to the
 
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
department from that the good questions
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
kind of so we we never could take we
 
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
didn't want to ever take money because
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
we felt that people would say oh you're
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
only doing this to generate money and
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
you're paying these stars and so what we
 
00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
did we asked the company to make
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
donations to our non-profit partner
 
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
which is a wildlife Heritage Foundation
 
00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
for every episode that was on and I kind
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
of we kind of negotiated that and I
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
didn't know anywhere near as much about
 
00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
television as I do today because I would
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
have negotiated uh much more
 
00:45:59.329 --> 00:45:59.339 align:start position:0%
aggressively I would have figured in
 
00:46:01.569 --> 00:46:01.579 align:start position:0%
something for reruns because we didn't
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
and so they ended up every time an
 
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
episode was aired they sent a two
 
00:46:08.089 --> 00:46:08.099 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar check to the Heritage
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
Foundation and the company owner was so
 
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
happy about the success of the program
 
00:46:15.849 --> 00:46:15.859 align:start position:0%
he would send ten thousand dollar checks
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
and and I would call him and say you
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
sent way too much money and he'd say no
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
I want that to go to the Heritage which
 
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
kind of gave me an idea how much money
 
00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:24.020 align:start position:0%
they were making
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
so we made a mistake there and if we
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
ever renegotiate that contract it's
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
going to be approached in a different
 
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
way the other thing that I insisted on
 
00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:35.220 align:start position:0%
the contract was full edit rights so
 
00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
what you see is we have control over and
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
I was very glad we did that because in
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
the example of the truck they wanted to
 
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
show that skeleton coming up in the
 
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
truck because it makes for great
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
television you know we're concerned
 
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
about families in New Hampshire and I
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
didn't want kids watching this show at
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
seven o'clock at night to see that and I
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
said and I was convinced I said this
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
show will succeed without that and it
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
did so we would we would keep those at
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
it right so they wouldn't have us on so
 
00:47:04.609 --> 00:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
00:47:04.619 --> 00:47:05.450 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
committee

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%

every color Labrador
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and those are donated through a board
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
member on the wildlife Heritage
 
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
Foundation and they are they all come
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
from Rise and Shine kennels hunting dogs
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
regularly over here
 
00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
um some of you may know her if you've
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
been in the house for any length of time
 
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
she was an assistant to rep Senator
 
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
Bradley here for many years and we stole
 
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
her not from Senator Bradley but we
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
stole her from the insurance business
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
and she works for us now so she will be
 
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
here a lot with us and three or four of
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs that you see behind me thank
 
00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions no okay we'll
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
do I hit the it's working I can hear it
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
hi so my name is Diane Timmins I'm the
 
00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
Inland Fisheries division Chief I am
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
rooted in field biology I've been
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
working with the department for 27 years
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
now and um just recently I like to say
 
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
recently Kathy keeps telling me I can't
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
say I'm the new kid anymore but I keep
 
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
using that excuse it helps on the things
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
that I'm still learning so I started as
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
the Fisheries division Chief in July of
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
21 so I guess technically I have been
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
here for a little while so
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
um but first I'd like to just talk about
 
00:48:53.089 --> 00:48:53.099 align:start position:0%
who the Inland Fisheries division is and
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
then also what we do so there are 38 of
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
us that does include hatcheries as
 
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
director Mason had mentioned and the
 
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
Hatchery people are there's 27 people in
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
our hatcheries there's six full active
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
hatcheries on throughout the state and
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
27 people reside there and then 11
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
people were work in the Inland Fisheries
 
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
division so in the I say Inland
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
Fisheries we're all Inland Fisheries but
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
the biological staff so there's Regional
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
Offices spread throughout the state
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
there's usually two Inland Fisheries
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
division folks there at each office and
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
then so up North Region one middle part
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
of the state region two Marine Division
 
00:49:41.329 --> 00:49:41.339 align:start position:0%
Region 3 and headquarters as well as
 
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
region four and then within headquarters
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
we have a few staff as well so it seems
 
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
like there's a big group of us but we're
 
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
really not all together ever so
 
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
um but then we also have one vacant
 
00:49:58.849 --> 00:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
position that's a hatchery supervisor so
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
that person would oversee all six
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and all the projects
 
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
especially those related to arpa and so
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
if anybody knows anybody that's slightly
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
chaotic lots of energy and maybe
 
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.170 align:start position:0%
chaotic lots of energy and maybe
slightly

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
slightly
 
00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:12.770 align:start position:0%
slightly
um

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to say it properly but
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
maybe up here a little loose wants to
 
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
come to our Hatchery position come on
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
board because it is chaos but we really
 
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
need a person so super it's exciting we
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
have a lot of really good projects and
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
um we're really excited about the
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
modernization project and the
 
00:50:30.599 --> 00:50:32.030 align:start position:0%
modernization project and the
feasibility

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
feasibility
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
um representative Harvey had asked about
 
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
the feasibility that one is actually
 
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
working to identify what we can do and
 
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
identify what our best step would be
 
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
what our next step should be and then
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
the 55 million modernization project
 
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:51.059 align:start position:0%
will be working toward that and
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
activating that action so
 
00:50:56.809 --> 00:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
um and there's five Pro our funding
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
comes from our dedicated license sales
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
as well as the habitat fee so our
 
00:51:06.049 --> 00:51:06.059 align:start position:0%
Fisheries license and habitat fee as
 
00:51:09.049 --> 00:51:09.059 align:start position:0%
well as the federal programs you know
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
Dingle Johnson 75 25 percent
 
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
um us and then private donations as well
 
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
as some minor other things
 
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
so our staff Works in really five
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
designated programs we have the cold
 
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
water program that includes wild trout
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
quality pond fishing
 
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
stocking all of that type of stuff is
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
really involved in that it's a really
 
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
really quick summary for a very big
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
umbrella so all of our Brookshire work
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's done throughout the state all of
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
that is included in that cold water
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
program so there's a lot of staff that
 
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
are actively involved in a multitude of
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
federal organizations Federal
 
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.059 align:start position:0%
collaborations and Partnerships and all
 
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
of that is working toward cold water
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
stuff so our Hatchery six of them we
 
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
stock over a million fish in the state
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and that's between 700
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
lakes and 900 streams so that's mostly
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
what we stock now back in the olden days
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
we had stocked everything under the sun
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
you name it Pacific salmon in the
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
Atlantic portion of the world seems a
 
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
little crazy but we did it and now we're
 
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
predominantly focused on landlocked
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
salmon Rainbow Trout Brook Trout and
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
brown trout
 
00:52:29.089 --> 00:52:29.099 align:start position:0%
we have the Fisheries habitat
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
restoration and land conservation
 
00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
program so that's looking at Dam
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
removals looking at stream Crossing
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
restoration projects looking at
 
00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.030 align:start position:0%
restoration projects looking at
um

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
land protection all of that is involved
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
in that program we also have the large
 
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
lakes program so that's mostly what you
 
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
see in Winnipesaukee Squam the
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lake Sunapee all those big
 
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
lake areas that do landlocked salmon and
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
smelt work forage studies that we do in
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
the summer those are done at night boat
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
with lots of electricity if anybody's
 
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
ever seen folks like why are these
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
people out here at you know 11 P.M to
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
midnight or sometimes one o'clock two
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning that's for our
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
forage study base and those the smaller
 
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
fish the smelt juveniles and yellow
 
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.579 align:start position:0%
perch and white perch tend to come up to
 
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
the surface a little bit so we can
 
00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:19.930 align:start position:0%
the surface a little bit so we can
actually

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:19.940 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
collect them and do samples to be able
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
to determine where what our capacity is
 
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
for salmon for the following year
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
so um then we also have our Fish
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
Conservation program so that's mostly
 
00:53:34.609 --> 00:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
looking at our threatened and endangered
 
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
species as well as our migratory species
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
and species of greatest concern so that
 
00:53:44.329 --> 00:53:44.339 align:start position:0%
program is actively involved it also
 
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
deals with the wildlife action plan
 
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
which is a huge part of our strategic
 
00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:50.030 align:start position:0%
which is a huge part of our strategic
operation

00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
the warm water program is Largemouth
 
00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
smallmouth bass we call those black bass
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
but and Sunfish work as well as warm
 
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
water habitat work and then also bass
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
tournaments that occur throughout the
 
00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
state a lot of those are on our bigger
 
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
Lakes but all of that needs to be
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
managed and gets permitted and all of
 
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
that happens in the Inland Fisheries
 
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.430 align:start position:0%
that happens in the Inland Fisheries
division

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
so um more on what we do so we manage in
 
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
a nutshell we manage monitor can and
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
conserve fish species in their habitats
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
and basically we're looking at not only
 
00:54:26.809 --> 00:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
the species but also what opportunities
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
we can provide to our Anglers so it's
 
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
not just the fish part of it so to speak
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's all of that plus the public
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
Outreach and education so looking to
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody understands and
 
00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page on the
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
conservation as well as the use we want
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people are able to
 
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
have a good time out there so
 
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
collaborate a lot with Garrett on access
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
and yes Big Dreams with access we never
 
00:54:54.049 --> 00:54:54.059 align:start position:0%
turn it down
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
um so the other thing we do the
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
monitoring of threatened and endangered
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
species we have tons of threatened and
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
endangered fish species in the state of
 
00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire some of the big ones are
 
00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:06.380 align:start position:0%
American Brook Lamprey Bridal Shiner
 
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
Whitefish and other migratory fish such
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
as Shad eels and some Atlantic salmon
 
00:55:13.559 --> 00:55:14.809 align:start position:0%
as Shad eels and some Atlantic salmon
still

00:55:14.809 --> 00:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
then we conduct and coordinate
 
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
scientific research we collaborate with
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
a multitude of non-governmental
 
00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
organizations as well as Plymouth State
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
University as well not so much with UNH
 
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
because they don't have a Fisheries
 
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
program but they do have some Fisheries
 
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
classes and now that I'm in this
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
position that partnership I hope will
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
grow because that's something I'd like
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
to do but we also do work with other
 
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
out-of-state entities as well as far
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
um and then we also provide technical
 
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
assistance on a variety of grant
 
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
opportunities with municipalities as
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
well as those non-governmental
 
00:55:56.569 --> 00:55:56.579 align:start position:0%
organizations so working with trout
 
00:55:59.569 --> 00:55:59.579 align:start position:0%
unlimited working with various towns as
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
I mentioned for stream Crossing projects
 
00:56:04.849 --> 00:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
Dam removals land protection anything
 
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
like that that would benefit our fish
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
species and their habitat so with that
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes Mr
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
Vice chair
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair sorry good morning
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
where are you
 
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick question on I know last
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
year there was an issue trying to get
 
00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
rainbow trout in the stocking and you
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
know what I'm talking about how is that
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
looking for this year going forward it
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
looks great so we um collected extra
 
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
species to be safe so we actually have a
 
00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
little bit of an overage right now
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
um but still there's still some there's
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
always natural mortality in the
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
hatcheries that just occurs
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
um so we have a buffer for that and but
 
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
everything is looking awesome I think
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
that we we are doing the numbers right
 
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
now and everything looks great
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you I mean I found
 
00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
Plenty of Fish out there but I just
 
00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
can't imagine if there was more of what
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
it would be like it was still really
 
00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
good fishing yeah we weren't actually
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
short by I was just looking at this
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:57:11.089 --> 00:57:11.099 align:start position:0%
um over 50 Waters that didn't get fished
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
last year that normally get rainbow
 
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
trout because of our shortage so
 
00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:19.970 align:start position:0%
any other questions
representative

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair if I understand
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
correctly when a pond is stocked uh
 
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
there's no process to let fishermen know
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
that it that it's stocked is that
 
00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
somebody a buddy of mine who's an avid
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
fisherman told me that is that an
 
00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
accurate assessment no and I'm glad you
 
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
asked that question so thank you
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
um so we started last year an online
 
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
active map that actually shows all of
 
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:48.260 align:start position:0%
the stocking in New Hampshire it happens
 
00:57:51.049 --> 00:57:51.059 align:start position:0%
two days after the stocking event has
 
00:57:53.569 --> 00:57:53.579 align:start position:0%
occurred just so we have time to qaqc
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
make sure somebody didn't add an extra
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
zero and then the following Year
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
everybody would be looking forward to
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
that extra zero and it would not occur
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
so it just gives us a couple just to
 
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
make sure everything's right but the
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
active program is is on our website and
 
00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
you can click on that it's under stock
 
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
going to fisheries and under stocking
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
and you click on the active map and
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
there's a map that shows you what was
 
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
stocked and so you can go to it via the
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
where you are locate related to C and
 
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
then there's also a table below that
 
00:58:25.609 --> 00:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
gives you the summary awesome thank you
 
00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.099 --> 00:58:35.210 align:start position:0%
 
yep

chairman and thanks for providing the
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
time today
 
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
um to come in and talk about the
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
different divisions
 
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
as the Director mentioned Dan Bergeron
 
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
who is our Wildlife division Chief is in
 
00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
a senate hearing this morning so
 
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna fill in for him um I'm the
 
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
game program supervisor for the Wildlife
 
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
Division and that's a very new position
 
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
for me I've been in that position for
 
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
about two months now I served in the
 
00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
Department's bear biologists for the
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
past 21 years and I've been with the
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
agency about 28. but to talk a little
 
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
bit about the wildlife Division and and
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
who we are and what we do we have 32
 
01:00:05.329 --> 01:00:05.339 align:start position:0%
full-time staff in the wildlife Division
 
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
and On Any Given summer depending on
 
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
funding we might have up to about 10
 
01:00:13.849 --> 01:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
seasonals and most of these people that
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
fill these positions have advanced
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
degrees in either wildlife management or
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
conservation biology it's it's a very
 
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
competitive field you know a lot of
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
people wanna
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know work for a while uh natural
 
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
resource the management agency so the
 
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
work we do kind of falls into five broad
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
categories and these include game
 
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
management uh non-game and endangered
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
species management land conservation and
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
habitat management data collection entry
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
and Analysis you know data is always
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
necessary to make good good
 
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
science-based management decisions as
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
well as the mitigation of wildlife human
 
01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
conflicts and animal damage which is an
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
increasing thing that that we're dealing
 
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
with it with his managers our funding is
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
is primarily through the sale of hunting
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
licenses and dedicated species-specific
 
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:11.220 align:start position:0%
permits but also as others have
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh the the Federal Federal
 
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
grant monies in addition to that there
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
are some other funding sources for some
 
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
of the wildlife division programs
 
01:01:23.329 --> 01:01:23.339 align:start position:0%
specifically as it relates to non-game
 
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
and that that includes the revenue from
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
the sale of the Moose license plate as
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
well as private donations by individuals
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
to the non-game program which is matched
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
up to a hundred thousand dollars through
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
state general fund money so you know
 
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
very important funding sources for for
 
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
those non-game programs so what we do
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
well we we manage the various game
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
species in the state this includes dear
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
moose bear turkey small game fur bearers
 
01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
as well as waterfalls so we manage those
 
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
species keep those populations
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
at socially acceptable levels and
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
provide that recreational opportunity to
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
folks we can serve and monitor uh
 
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
non-game and threatened species
 
01:02:14.049 --> 01:02:14.059 align:start position:0%
including a various species of turtles
 
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
species such as cottontail rabbits bald
 
01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.010 align:start position:0%
species such as cottontail rabbits bald
eagles

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:18.020 align:start position:0%
eagles
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
peregrine falcons Carnival butterflies
 
01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
and in in addition to the ones I've
 
01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's a lot of additional
 
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
species on the list that really require
 
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
very specific conservation need
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
we conduct and coordinate scientific
 
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
research to inform decision making and
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has been one of the
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
leading States in New England with some
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
pretty important research activities
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
over the past several years many of
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
these related to to Moose and kind of
 
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
the plight that moose are facing in our
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
in our current ecosystem
 
01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
we can serve and manage habitat for
 
01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:56.339 align:start position:0%
wildlife on approximately sixty Thousand
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
Acres owned by the Hampshire fishing
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
game and an additional Twenty Thousand
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
Acres that we've been able to conserve
 
01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
through easement
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
and we provide technical assistance to
 
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities industrial Forest land
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
owners as well as smaller private
 
01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
landowners people who are interested in
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
conserving Wildlife on their on their
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
properties the notion of of these Timber
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
companies is really a thing of the old
 
01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:26.579 align:start position:0%
days most of these large Forest lands in
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
the northern part of the state are now
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
owned by investment companies but
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
nonetheless they're they're big tracks
 
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
of land open to public access open to
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
recreational hunting and fishing and
 
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
trapping and we have an ability to work
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
closely with them to to improve these
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
these large Forest blocks for for
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
increased wildlife habitat and Wildlife
 
01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.569 align:start position:0%
increased wildlife habitat and Wildlife
production

01:03:47.569 --> 01:03:47.579 align:start position:0%
production
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
and we also spend a lot of you know as
 
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
our as our human populations grow and as
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
our our species population grows it's
 
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
putting humans in in Critters in Greater
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
um Conflict at a higher rate you know
 
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
we're all trying to share space so the
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
wildlife division invests a lot of time
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
and resources into mitigating conflicts
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
between wildlife and um in the public
 
01:04:14.089 --> 01:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
and kind of our approach is to try to
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
minimize these conflicts to education we
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
provide technical assistance we also
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
have a very uh popular
 
01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
program where we loan out abatement
 
01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
materials things such as electric
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
fencing those type of things and our
 
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal here is we're trying to
 
01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
teach people how to coexist with with
 
01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:34.339 align:start position:0%
our critters here in the state and
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
increase tolerance and in one reason
 
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
we've been able to successfully have the
 
01:04:41.329 --> 01:04:41.339 align:start position:0%
program that we have in New Hampshire is
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
we have a unique partnership with the
 
01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:47.420 align:start position:0%
federal agency USDA wildlife services
 
01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
and that is a relationship that's unique
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire so we've been very
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
fortunate that we've been able to invest
 
01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:57.059 align:start position:0%
a lot of resources into that into that
 
01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:57.789 align:start position:0%
a lot of resources into that into that
program

01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be brief because I want to
 
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
leave any time for anybody else but if
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
there's any questions I'm happy to
 
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
to take some I think we'll hold the
 
01:05:08.809 --> 01:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
questions and we'll get back to the
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
questions after we deal with the the
 
01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:12.299 align:start position:0%
bill that we've got coming up because
 
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
it's uh after 11 now and we're supposed
 
01:05:16.849 --> 01:05:16.859 align:start position:0%
to start around 11. okay but thank you
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you for your
 
01:05:18.119 --> 01:05:23.690 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you for your
testimony

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:27.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.809 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

01:05:29.809 --> 01:05:29.819 align:start position:0%

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
stick around to answer questions still
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm going to open the
 
01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes uh the prime sponsor of
 
01:05:54.289 --> 01:05:54.299 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:12.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:12.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
to have the bill introduced I want to
 
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
explain uh across procedure technicality
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
that I found out about this morning in
 
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
the chairs meeting we have two
 
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
amendments uh that I've been notified
 
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
about coming on this bill but they are
 
01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:30.299 align:start position:0%
extensive enough they're not just minor
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
Corrections that they are going to
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
require their own noticed public hearing
 
01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
so uh what we will get to talk about or
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
listen to today is is anybody who wants
 
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
to testify on the underlying bill but
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
not so much the Amendments we will get
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
an introduction to what those amendments
 
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
are but the hearings for those will be
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
noticed uh separately at a later date
 
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to intend to do an exact
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
session following those amendments
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:14.289 align:start position:0%

those for another public hearing right
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%

House Bill
442

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
442
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
which as you can hear is uh somewhat at
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
a period of flux
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
um we uh I should give you a little of
 
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
the history of how this occurred
 
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
we were contacted
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
I think a half hour before the deadline
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
of filing legislation and uh by someone
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
purported to be
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
a spokesperson or at least a member of
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
the lobstering community and asked if we
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
would file legislation for them
 
01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:41.930 align:start position:0%
would file legislation for them
um

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
what you see in front of you on the
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
first part is that is what that was
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
requested it was a request to submit
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
legislation to
 
01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.030 align:start position:0%
legislation to
[Music]

01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:56.930 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
ask that no state funds be used to
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
enforce federal regulations
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell or in in totality
 
01:09:08.339 --> 01:09:09.050 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell or in in totality
um

01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
since then and since the bill came out
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
and was approved we have some new
 
01:09:21.849 --> 01:09:21.859 align:start position:0%
knowledge and that's in the form of this
 
01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
commentary that I passed out to you just
 
01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:26.900 align:start position:0%
a second ago
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
and that says on the very first page
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
Maine's delegation Congressional
 
01:09:35.809 --> 01:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
Delegation amended the federal spending
 
01:09:38.890 --> 01:09:38.900 align:start position:0%
Bill to delay the new regulations until
 
01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
2028 and called for more research on
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
whale entanglements and ropeless fishing
 
01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.669 align:start position:0%
whale entanglements and ropeless fishing
gear

01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
gear
 
01:09:46.679 --> 01:09:47.209 align:start position:0%
gear
um

01:09:47.209 --> 01:09:47.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
Maine's delegation was able to do what
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
no one else was able to do apparently
 
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
and delay this for uh about six years
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
um should have been a collective sigh of
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
relief and and um and somewhat guarded
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
um exaltation by uh by the lobstering
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
community I believe
 
01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:08.630 align:start position:0%
community I believe
um

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
where that goes I don't know obviously
 
01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
and I don't think anyone does but we
 
01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:17.900 align:start position:0%
were attempting to to help
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
the lobstering community with what
 
01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:26.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
having that that change in the law or
 
01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.130 align:start position:0%
having that that change in the law or
that

01:10:36.130 --> 01:10:36.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:39.169 --> 01:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
modification in the law meant that that
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
single line in this bill
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
was rendered we don't we don't need it
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
so that's one part of the amendment
 
01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
that's coming is to eliminate that line
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
second part of the bill
 
01:10:58.450 --> 01:10:58.460 align:start position:0%
um is is the return of the
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
discussion and on allowing our New
 
01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents access to the
 
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
natural resource Lobsters by utilizing
 
01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
scuba and and
 
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
10 10 digits at least for the short term
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
10 digits to uh to access lobsters our
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
natural resources yeah you got it
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
um but uh but what we um are hoping to
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
put forth is is an amendment to um to
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
again try to work with the the
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
lobstering community and this is the the
 
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
other parts of the amendment which I
 
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
think is on the table over to our side
 
01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.590 align:start position:0%
think is on the table over to our side
yes

01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.490 align:start position:0%
yes
um

01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
and that is to um
 
01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
to somewhat work on
 
01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:54.260 align:start position:0%
um one of the key phrases that's used
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
constantly in our natural resources
 
01:11:59.689 --> 01:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
which is sustainability
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
um there is a
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
unknown to to many
 
01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
um perhaps even on this committee is uh
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
our our impediments to our natural
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
resource which are contained in bycatch
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
which is what the other article was
 
01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:19.820 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
and also ghost traps
 
01:12:27.169 --> 01:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you a quick primer on ghost
 
01:12:27.179 --> 01:12:29.209 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you a quick primer on ghost
traps

01:12:29.209 --> 01:12:29.219 align:start position:0%
traps
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's estimates of as high as 10
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
percent of the lobster and gear that
 
01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
commercial lobsters use that that get
 
01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
lost every year either by boat traffic
 
01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:43.100 align:start position:0%
or by storms or whatever
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
they are no longer accessible from the
 
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.209 align:start position:0%
they are no longer accessible from the
surface

01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
surface
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
and uh and we passed a bill uh two years
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
ago that I've lost the number for 147
 
01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 147 that charged all of
 
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
these guys an extra fee in order to do
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
cleanup Coastal cleanup
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
um it started last January and so
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
they've just collected one year worth of
 
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.070 align:start position:0%
they've just collected one year worth of
fees

01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
interestingly the bill doesn't include
 
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
cleanup underwater it only includes the
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
cleanup on on shore
 
01:13:22.199 --> 01:13:23.570 align:start position:0%
cleanup on on shore
well

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
any diver can tell you that is been out
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
anywhere beyond their knees that there
 
01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:36.620 align:start position:0%
are literally thousands of traps that
 
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
remain in our Coastal Waters that that
 
01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
catch continued to catch even though
 
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
they're underwater there's been a couple
 
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
of attempts to redesign traps so that
 
01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
they have biodegradable discs
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
some of those work some of the time some
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
of them take a longer time to to
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
dissolve in order to allow the the
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
lobsters that are inside well I should
 
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
say all creatures that are inside
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
because there's sometimes fish sometimes
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
crabs sometimes Lobster inside those
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
traps to escape
 
01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
however storms sometimes tip them on the
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
sides so those those biodegradable discs
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
don't work sometimes it's just a tangle
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
you can't believe on the floor from
 
01:14:24.729 --> 01:14:24.739 align:start position:0%
oceans and The Surge
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
so there are mountains literally
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
mountains of of traps that continue to
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
catch Lobster and and it's a continuous
 
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
process so a lobster goes in gets gets
 
01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
caught in there dies that becomes bait
 
01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:42.380 align:start position:0%
for the next lobsters to come in and die
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
and they are saying uh from the from
 
01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
every reading that I've keep coming up
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
with the 10 number the 10 is what the
 
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
number of lobsters traps that are lost
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
in a year so we know pretty much what
 
01:15:00.649 --> 01:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
that number would be
 
01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
um and and those are continuing by and
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
large to uh to fish some get damaged
 
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
beyond recognition but some still exist
 
01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of different
 
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
organizations one is called drag in
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth the other is oceans-wide and
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
I and you received a a video over the
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
weekend of Ocean's wide operation
 
01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:29.420 align:start position:0%
because they had a really nice short
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
explanation of how they operate their
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
goal is to get these ghost traps
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
out of our fishing Waters
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
and and thereby you should you should be
 
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
aware or you should have made the
 
01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
connection that that ghost traps catch
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
indiscriminately so they could be
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
catching pregnant females with you know
 
01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
as many as 10 000 eggs on them so you
 
01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
know all of that goes to the
 
01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
sustainability is is to my way of
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
thinking it would be in all of our best
 
01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.229 align:start position:0%
thinking it would be in all of our best
interests

01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
interests
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
divers lobstermen
 
01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:08.570 align:start position:0%
divers lobstermen
um

01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
anyone that cares about our community to
 
01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
get rid of those ghost traps as
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
efficiently and and as quickly as we can
 
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
I maintain the most efficient manner to
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
do that is uh with a partnership with
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
with our scuba diving community
 
01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
and to that end you'll you'll hear from
 
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
people that own dive shops that would be
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
willing to help with the uh with the
 
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
training and and
 
01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
Arrangements in that line I'll let them
 
01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
speak to that but that's part of the
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
additional amendment that we're coming
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
in with to try to figure out a way that
 
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
we can actually work together increase
 
01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.910 align:start position:0%
we can actually work together increase
sustainability

01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
sustainability
 
01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:54.490 align:start position:0%
sustainability
increase

01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:54.500 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
all of the operation at the same time we
 
01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:01.460 align:start position:0%
allow scuba divers to have some access
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
on a on a non-commercial recreational
 
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
basis right now we do have a
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
non-commercial license which allows
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire residents to have five
 
01:17:13.739 --> 01:17:15.050 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire residents to have five
pots

01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
pots
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
I think it is maybe it's tent I keep
 
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
going back on that Massachusetts I think
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
is 10 I'm not sure if we're five but the
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
point is you have to have a boat you
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
have to live somewhere near the coast
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
you have to have a very forgiving spouse
 
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
to be able to let you go and visit your
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
traps every uh every couple of days it
 
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
is it's an extensive process where
 
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
someone that is a diver could be living
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
in koas county and come down for a day
 
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
with it with their license we have also
 
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
set up designated areas so to help with
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
the complaints or the concerns that we
 
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
had from fish and game that felt that
 
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
they were unable to enforce it
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
um we we are suggesting designated areas
 
01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
that would be diving only so they could
 
01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:06.500 align:start position:0%
be visible from the shore they could
 
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
witness the divers coming out of the
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
water with with and count to five you
 
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
know or three I forget what the number
 
01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
is that moves around too it's a short
 
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
season but our goal is to try to
 
01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.149 align:start position:0%
season but our goal is to try to
um

01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
solicit or or enable our New Hampshire
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
residents access to this natural
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
resource I could go on as you can
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
imagine but I'm happy to leave it here
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
and let the professionals that are
 
01:18:37.450 --> 01:18:37.460 align:start position:0%
coming behind me answer
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
some of the questions but I'm happy to
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
take whatever questions anyone has now
 
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
thank you representative does anybody
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
yes you've been recognized
 
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
um representative Cobalt just a
 
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
procedural question with respect to the
 
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
Amendments I know that the Amendments
 
01:18:56.219 --> 01:18:57.050 align:start position:0%
Amendments I know that the Amendments
will

01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
get a hearing at another time but I see
 
01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.229 align:start position:0%
get a hearing at another time but I see
that

01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:00.239 --> 01:19:01.910 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment 195.
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
replaces all text after the enacting
 
01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.330 align:start position:0%
replaces all text after the enacting
clause

01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
clause
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment 196 replaces section one
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
so if we adopt 195 and then 196 I think
 
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
achieving an unintended consequence if
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
we go in the opposite order
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
I I suspect because if we if we adopt
 
01:19:29.689 --> 01:19:29.699 align:start position:0%
195 then section one which is replaced
 
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
with 196 is is gone at that point if I'm
 
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly if we do it in
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
the opposite order
 
01:19:36.719 --> 01:19:37.970 align:start position:0%
the opposite order
um

01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
and adopt 196 first then 195 obliterates
 
01:19:45.649 --> 01:19:45.659 align:start position:0%
196. so uh just I I may be reading that
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
wrong but uh if if if I'm correct then
 
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
we probably need either a single clean
 
01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment or to correct some of that
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
language so that we're not stepping on
 
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
one with the other
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative I I believe you're you're
 
01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct um but we will this
 
01:20:08.209 --> 01:20:08.219 align:start position:0%
will be handled I think I I I don't know
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
the procedure that's been talked about
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
with internally
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
um so I'm happy to leave it in the hands
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
of your of your very capable leadership
 
01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.689 align:start position:0%
of your of your very capable leadership
team

01:20:20.689 --> 01:20:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
Madam clerk I recognize you
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so whilst representative
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
kofault is correct about that effect in
 
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
adopting multiple amendments on the
 
01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
floor my understanding of process is
 
01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
that when committees adopt multiple
 
01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
amendments there cannot be more than one
 
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment OLS has to merge all
 
01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:44.219 align:start position:0%
said amendments together and then create
 
01:20:46.850 --> 01:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
the committee's intended Amendment so
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
that is not a risk for committee
 
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
amendments being adopted but it is
 
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
indeed a risk for floor amendments being
 
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.910 align:start position:0%
indeed a risk for floor amendments being
adopted

01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.729 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
Brown

01:21:01.729 --> 01:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
Brown
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair for taking my
 
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
question on line three and four uh of
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
the original
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
a couple uh I'll do this one question at
 
01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
a time tier if I can
 
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
um State resources means fish and game
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
and or
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
possibly who else State the the word
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
State there means Fish and Game
 
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.350 align:start position:0%
State there means Fish and Game
resources

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.209 align:start position:0%
resources
um

01:21:29.209 --> 01:21:29.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
it really uh thank you for your question
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
um that's the part that's going to be
 
01:21:36.649 --> 01:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
removed so it's it's not uh
 
01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue that it won't be part
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
of the original bill it won't be part of
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
the bill when we get to a vote here on
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
the committee okay follow-up
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you so you you said that
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
that line will come out
 
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
because of what the main congressive
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
delegation managed to accomplish right
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
but as I read them they aren't the same
 
01:22:00.719 --> 01:22:02.110 align:start position:0%
but as I read them they aren't the same
thing

01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
lobstering regulations is what you have
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
in line three and four and the main
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
Congressional delegations work is on
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
whale entanglements on ropless fishing
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
gear so I don't can can you or someone
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
following you explain how the main
 
01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
Congressional work is eliminating this
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
line for lobstering regulations
 
01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
um I can try but I'm certain that
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
there's somebody that can do it better
 
01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.030 align:start position:0%
there's somebody that can do it better
um

01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.630 --> 01:22:32.640 align:start position:0%

01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
proposal or idea is successful in the
 
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:42.420 align:start position:0%

anything like that
 
01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
um as far as uh his current law

um as far as uh his current law
um

01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
scuba diving for lobsters is legal in
 
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
all states on the East Coast except for
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Maine
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
um so that's where the experience exists
 
01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
I actually for point of information I
 
01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
actually do still control and have a a
 
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts license for scuba diving
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman always a pleasure
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
and the chair is going to call Weldon
 
01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:44.149 align:start position:0%
and the chair is going to call Weldon
Bosworth

01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
Bosworth
 
01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try to hold people to their
 
01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
time that they've asked so I'll give you
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
a five minute reminder if you uh hit
 
01:23:59.770 --> 01:23:59.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
put half on each end and we'll pass them
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.130 --> 01:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee my
 
01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
name is Weldon Bosworth I'm a resident
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
of Guilford
 
01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
and I was asked by the proponents of
 
01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
to testify as to some of his issues that
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
have been raised by it
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
now I was asked because of my training
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
experience I actually am a marine
 
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
biologist I've got over 45 years
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
experience evaluating impacts to Marine
 
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
creatures and I have a PhD as well
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
though I'm retired now
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
so I have a pretty lengthy testimony
 
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
there and I'm not going to try to go
 
01:25:16.729 --> 01:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
through it but there are a couple of
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
issues there I'm going to address and
 
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
just to emphasize
 
01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
I actually passed out a little primer
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
there for questions to ask
 
01:25:29.570 --> 01:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
which you're free to ask me or uh you
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
know witnesses that are speakers that
 
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
are going to testify in advance
 
01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
first of all I'm a citizen of New
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I should have
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
the opportunity as a diver to get
 
01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
Harvest hunt for lobsters I can do it
 
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
for scallops by diving I can Spear Fish
 
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
by diving I can do it for crabs
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
as long as I stay within the limits and
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
the size that's perfectly legal and yet
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
we have this like barrier here to for me
 
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
to go and get some Lobsters by diving I
 
01:26:09.169 --> 01:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
used to do that when I was growing up in
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I know a lot about it
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
I know a lot about the near shore
 
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
benthic environment of New Hampshire I
 
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
did I was a manager of all the Baseline
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
studies for Seabrook station
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
I did a lot of them down in the piscata
 
01:26:24.729 --> 01:26:24.739 align:start position:0%
corps for Schiller station and Newington
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
so I've got uh let's say hundreds of
 
01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
hours there underwater observing the
 
01:26:34.129 --> 01:26:34.139 align:start position:0%
Marine habitat so I think it's really uh
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
prejudicial that I am not allowed as a
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
citizen of New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
who pays taxes to go after another
 
01:26:44.209 --> 01:26:44.219 align:start position:0%
public trust resource that of lobsters
 
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
so what is the impact of uh taking
 
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
Lobsters by uh by diving it's far less
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
than it is by taking them with traps
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
basically it's a very passive activity
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
you try to find the things first of all
 
01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
which is difficult you try to lure them
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
on of where wherever they're hidden
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
under either seaweed or the rocks and
 
01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
either using deception or what they call
 
01:27:09.169 --> 01:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
a tickle stick you get them out where
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
you can grab them very little impact
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
with Trap Fishing you basically have
 
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
traps on the bottom which are dragged
 
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
when they're pulled up some people use
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
trawls of many traps when you hook them
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
up and the boat's moving either by wind
 
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
or by Tides you can see it drags across
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
the lobster is caught in the Trap that
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
are not keepers are thrown overboard as
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
they float to the bottom they're
 
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to any predator until they
 
01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219 align:start position:0%
find a new home with diving if it's not
 
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
the one you want not the one you're
 
01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
going to take you basically leave it
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
alone or if you take it out to measure
 
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
it you put it back where it came from
 
01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
so I think the impact is very very low
 
01:27:53.689 --> 01:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
let's talk about it in terms of the
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
relative impact to the Lobster in terms
 
01:27:59.570 --> 01:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
of pounds taken New Hampshire Landings
 
01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
over the last five or six years have
 
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
range from five to six million pounds of
 
01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:06.350 align:start position:0%
range from five to six million pounds of
lobsters

01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
lobsters
 
01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of lobsters the
 
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
recreational license allows you to take
 
01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
a certain amount and the latest data I
 
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
found the landings for recreational
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
Lobster fishermen are about 0.5 percent
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
I have these numbers in my testimony of
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
that five to six million which makes it
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere on 25 to 30 000 pounds
 
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
on the other hand my calculations for
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
what we expected by divers in the time
 
01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
that's been allotted by this bill and
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
the anticipated limits and the fact that
 
01:28:42.649 --> 01:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't want to uh you
 
01:28:45.649 --> 01:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
know die three or four times a week I'd
 
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
say is around two to four thousand uh
 
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
pounds of lobsters per year
 
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
what we used to say in the Consulting
 
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
industry it's de minimis impact
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
last uh I just want to briefly discuss
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
the enforcement ask aspect of it because
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
in previous hearings this has come up as
 
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
something that's really different from
 
01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:10.139 align:start position:0%
what conservation officers like Colonel
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
Jordan have to do
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
I see this is no different than their
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities with a number of
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
different activities that they have to
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
basically enforce and I have a list of
 
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
them in there but I know you dig clams
 
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
over in the Hampton seaberg Flats
 
01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
there's nobody there they're watching
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
them from the shore with a spotting
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
scope or something or from a boat you
 
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
got head boats out there fishing three
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
miles offshore they may check them out
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
when they come back you got people out
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
there hunting seabook sea Ducks Before
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
Dawn or just at dawn off the coast
 
01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
they get them when they get back if they
 
01:29:49.610 --> 01:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
can see them when they get back now in
 
01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
the bill that's set up here they
 
01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
anticipate a zone for taking lobsters
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
which is no more than 100 meters or
 
01:29:58.250 --> 01:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
yards offshore
 
01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
and near points of access
 
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
to the ocean so you can a parking lot or
 
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
something like that the divers are going
 
01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
to have numbers on their tanks or their
 
01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
flags and when they come in there they
 
01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
can be asked to show what they got so I
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
don't see enforcement as any more of a
 
01:30:18.169 --> 01:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
insurmountable task as all the other
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing activities that the
 
01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
conservation office have to enforce and
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
I'll stop there that must be five
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
minutes at least
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay and almost but thank you are there
 
01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.209 --> 01:30:35.219 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:43.610 --> 01:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
the chair is going to call Eric Anderson
 
01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I've got some copies
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
I didn't make enough if you give them to
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
the clerk we'll take care of copies
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
I've had over 50 years of experience in

the water in the variety of marine
 
01:31:38.209 --> 01:31:38.219 align:start position:0%
fisheries at the State of New Hampshire
 
01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
offers I'm here expressing my thoughts
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
and opinions on House Bill 442
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
enacting as president of the New

Association that is in opposition of
 
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
I have been in front of this committee
 
01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
at least five previous times
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
as this bill has yet to go into the full
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
support of the legislature
 
01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:00.300 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:03.060 align:start position:0%

Game department in the New Hampshire
 
01:32:08.330 --> 01:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
Marine advisory committee opposes such a
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislation I hope you respect their
 
01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
expertise opinion and conclusion not to
 
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
01:32:19.129 --> 01:32:19.139 align:start position:0%
you will hear or have heard rational and
 
01:32:20.930 --> 01:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
logical testimonies don't allow this
 
01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
bill to move forward and I'll list some
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
of the reasons for you to consider it
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire for our state of New
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizen is not being denied
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
with access to this resource and
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
depending on one's level of commitment
 
01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
they can obtain a license to Harvard Law
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
Officers by means of trapping
 
01:32:42.649 --> 01:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire has over a
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
hundred year history of managing and
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
harvesting this resource by means of
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
trapping this strategy has proven well
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
this is not a wild fishery as one might
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
suspect it to be
 
01:33:05.689 --> 01:33:05.699 align:start position:0%
lobstering is a a form of aquaculture
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
um the commercial sector spends millions
 
01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
of dollars a year and millions of pounds
 
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
of bait to Foster this resource and
 
01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:16.250 align:start position:0%
of bait to Foster this resource and
um

01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:19.810 --> 01:33:19.820 align:start position:0%
there's been plenty of studies to
 
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
conclude that if you take traps away
 
01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
from the if you take traps out of the
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
water the lobsters disappear
 
01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
they've done a variety of studies on the
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
effects of trapping and and
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
the success of the resource
 
01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh you will hear from
 
01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
or have you will hear from the top
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
official for the New Hampshire fishing
 
01:33:44.450 --> 01:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
game enforcement that allowing The
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
Taking of officers by divers is not
 
01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:47.750 align:start position:0%
Taking of officers by divers is not
enforceable

01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
01:33:50.209 --> 01:33:50.219 align:start position:0%
and creates logistic and enforcement
 
01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
nice nightmares why is the responsible
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
committee for natural resources would
 
01:33:57.770 --> 01:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
you disregard that advice
 
01:33:59.810 --> 01:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
we respect the management enforcement
 
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
actions of New Hampshire fishing game
 
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
and hope you might do the same
 
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
allowing two different group user groups
 
01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
to harvest the same resource in the same
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
area and proximity create safety
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
concerns of enormous consequences a
 
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
diver in the same proximity of a trap
 
01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
fisherman is simply not a good set of
 
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
circumstances and you as a committee
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
should promote safety in your
 
01:34:21.719 --> 01:34:23.990 align:start position:0%
should promote safety in your
consideration

01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:34:26.689 --> 01:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
you might hear of derelict traps or the
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
concern of their work traps and the
 
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
concerned mortality of the lobsters that
 
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
that might be in these traps in fact the
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
current lobster trap is tremendously
 
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.250 align:start position:0%
current lobster trap is tremendously
inefficient

01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
inefficient
 
01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
in the way it catches lobsters
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
there are multiple accounts there are
 
01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
multiple conservation components built
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
into the trap to allow for escape
 
01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
in the course of the seven years
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
it takes a lobster to mature and grow to
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
a legal length it has been in that trap
 
01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
it has been in traps thousands of times
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
and it knows how to maneuver in and out
 
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
of that trap so the mortality issue I
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
don't think is a legitimate reason for
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
you lay here today for management
 
01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
concerns and disruption of habitat and
 
01:35:16.729 --> 01:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
the means of harvesting officers by
 
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
diving is not the best practice I hope
 
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
you respect that that opinion as there
 
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
is a hopeful testimony will incur
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
um I preference these comments to note
 
01:35:29.689 --> 01:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
that throughout the range of harvesting
 
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
lobsters in the Gulf of Maine currently
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Maine and Canada
 
01:35:37.729 --> 01:35:37.739 align:start position:0%
do not allow diving falopsis to the
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
south of us the Commonwealth of
 
01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:42.179 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does and from indications
 
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
of from their law enforcement regime it
 
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
regrets that allowance
 
01:35:50.689 --> 01:35:50.699 align:start position:0%
um being born and brought up in New
 
01:35:52.729 --> 01:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I might not agree with the
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
policies of my neighbors to the south in
 
01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
closing you've heard a well-haired
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
testimony the challenges and questions
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
or reasons to oppose House Bill 442 to
 
01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
move forward I hope you take the
 
01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
responsible action to it all this
 
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much
 
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.050 --> 01:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
the chair is going to call uh Louis
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
so it is still okay good he left it on
 
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your time my
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
name is Louis Figueroa I'm a resident of
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and I'm in support of House
 
01:36:44.689 --> 01:36:44.699 align:start position:0%
Bill 442 with the
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
We're not gonna do the post amendments
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
um by introduction I'm a Dive Master and
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
act as a dive guide for one of the local
 
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
dive shops in Merrimack New Hampshire
 
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
called aquatic Specialties as a dive
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
professional what I do is I guide divers
 
01:37:02.209 --> 01:37:02.219 align:start position:0%
and uh on Charter Dives and Dives short
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
Dives in the area I've been scuba diving
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know for over 40 years having
 
01:37:10.729 --> 01:37:10.739 align:start position:0%
logged probably most of the Dives in the
 
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
waters of New Hampshire
 
01:37:15.649 --> 01:37:15.659 align:start position:0%
um but like Greg I'm also a resident I
 
01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
have uh property on Cape Cod so I I have
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
a mass Lobster license so I'm familiar
 
01:37:20.639 --> 01:37:21.229 align:start position:0%
a mass Lobster license so I'm familiar
with

01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
um you know what it's like to dive
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
recreationally for lobsters off the
 
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
water of Cape Cod and Cape Ann
 
01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.490 align:start position:0%
water of Cape Cod and Cape Ann
um

01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:30.649 --> 01:37:30.659 align:start position:0%
one of the things that uh a strong feel
 
01:37:32.209 --> 01:37:32.219 align:start position:0%
that lobsters are a natural resource
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
just that it should be
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
um uh accessible to to you know everyone
 
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a limited few
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
um just like we can take scallops and so
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
on I um but also
 
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
you know I understand that yes we can
 
01:37:48.370 --> 01:37:48.380 align:start position:0%
take lobsters with a five pot
 
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
non-commercial license but as Craig
 
01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
pointed out you have to have a boat you
 
01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
have to uh you have to bait the the the
 
01:37:57.649 --> 01:37:57.659 align:start position:0%
the fish and you have to bait the pots
 
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
and and and it's it's just not practical
 
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
for someone me living in Merrimack
 
01:38:05.930 --> 01:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
driving to this ecos to do that
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
um the one thing that I really wanted to
 
01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
point out is I completely understand
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
that this is a valuable resource for the
 
01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
state and not just here but in in Maine
 
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
and and all the surrounding states
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
um what we're proposing is I think it's
 
01:38:22.610 --> 01:38:22.620 align:start position:0%
a compromise because we're limiting the
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
season as opposed to year round like in
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and and South
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
we're limiting the catch
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
um you know set by the the fishing game
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
the we're also uh restricting the number
 
01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
of permits
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
and um and then we're even looking at uh
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
We've proposed even restricting it to
 
01:38:43.370 --> 01:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
limiting it to certain zones
 
01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
um uh where we can where you can fish
 
01:38:48.169 --> 01:38:48.179 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that was also added
 
01:38:49.729 --> 01:38:49.739 align:start position:0%
was that we're we're going to collect
 
01:38:52.129 --> 01:38:52.139 align:start position:0%
data on The Landings
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
um in Massachusetts when you renew your
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
permit you put in how many you catch and
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
where and so on so they have that data
 
01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
um we're going to go a step further and
 
01:39:03.410 --> 01:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
and act and what we propose is when
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
you're out of the water within a certain
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know six hour period we can just
 
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
like as if I'm a Hunter and I hunt for
 
01:39:11.629 --> 01:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
something I shoot something I I report
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
what I what I shot
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
um so we would have that that data
 
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
reported um so that we at least at the
 
01:39:21.410 --> 01:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
end of the season we'll or we'll we'll
 
01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:24.179 align:start position:0%
have an A an idea of the percentage of
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
Landings are uh catch bought caught by
 
01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
recreational scuba divers
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
um so that you know the other thing is
 
01:39:34.129 --> 01:39:34.139 align:start position:0%
that uh I I did consult with some of the
 
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
other experts in in the area like for
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
example the uh Massachusetts Department
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
of Marine Resources
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
um you know they're they're letting us
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
know that it's less than five percent of
 
01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
all the landings that uh are caught in
 
01:39:48.169 --> 01:39:48.179 align:start position:0%
you know through commercial and
 
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
non-commercial pots um and diverses are
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
are caught in the state of Massachusetts
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
as far as enforcement I also consulted
 
01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
with uh some of the environmental police
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
um who all admitted that this is not an
 
01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:03.659 align:start position:0%
issue that they spend a lot of
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
inordinate amount of time policing um
 
01:40:08.209 --> 01:40:08.219 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
they they're mostly focused on uh the
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
random checks that they're doing
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
checking people checking fish and
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
measuring the the size of the fish and
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
lobsters but they're not there's that
 
01:40:20.810 --> 01:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
perception that uh conservation officers
 
01:40:22.129 --> 01:40:22.139 align:start position:0%
or environmental police have to be in
 
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
the water in In Scuba Diving catching
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
um uh you know culprits it it's just far
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
from the truth so it's not a big
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
Enforcement issue in the state and
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
um obviously I had asked if they could
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
be willing to testify to that but they
 
01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
said they can't because they have to
 
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
appear objective on both the DMR and the
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
environmental police
 
01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:44.219 align:start position:0%
but one of the things I wanted to point
 
01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
out what if you look at what we're
 
01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
proposing of a hundred permits per year
 
01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
for a limited season
 
01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:52.129 align:start position:0%
for a limited season
um

01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:52.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
during that season if if in a two-month
 
01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
period I think a diver would be lucky if
 
01:41:00.169 --> 01:41:00.179 align:start position:0%
they're getting maybe five to ten
 
01:41:00.179 --> 01:41:01.669 align:start position:0%
they're getting maybe five to ten
lobsters

01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
lobsters
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
um through recreational scuba diving in
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
um I would doubt that there would
 
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
probably be more than 50 divers that
 
01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
would actually seek those permits so if
 
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
you do the math we're only talking
 
01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
you know 250 to 500 lobsters that would
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
be caught through uh recreational scuba
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
diving so
 
01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's a big number but
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
the last thing I wanted to do is that
 
01:41:30.169 --> 01:41:30.179 align:start position:0%
that talk about is that
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
I wanted to help everyone understand
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
that what we're what we're doing is
 
01:41:37.729 --> 01:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
actually better than if I were to get a
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
boat and get a five pot non-commercial
 
01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:41.209 align:start position:0%
boat and get a five pot non-commercial
license

01:41:41.209 --> 01:41:41.219 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:41:43.850 --> 01:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
the way that I get lobsters today it's
 
01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
it's a lot less as as well then
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
testified passive because I'm not
 
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
dragging my pots along the bottom and
 
01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
then when I bring up my lobsters I'm
 
01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
um I'm checking them I'm checking to see
 
01:41:57.169 --> 01:41:57.179 align:start position:0%
if they're egg bearing I'm checking them
 
01:41:59.689 --> 01:41:59.699 align:start position:0%
for size and then I'm dropping them back
 
01:42:01.729 --> 01:42:01.739 align:start position:0%
in and during that time they're exposed
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
to you know uh predators and and striped
 
01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
bass whereas when you're diving you're
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
actually at the source you're looking
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're you're
 
01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
um you see one and you look at it you
 
01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.659 align:start position:0%
you can quickly tell if it's legal or
 
01:42:18.169 --> 01:42:18.179 align:start position:0%
not you have to size it before you you
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
can't bring it up to the surface and
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
then size it you have to have it sized
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
right there and you put it right back
 
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
where where it is so it's not
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
susceptible to Predators uh during that
 
01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:29.990 align:start position:0%
susceptible to Predators uh during that
period

01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to kind of reinforce
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
that this is a little bit more
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
sustainable but the other thing is that
 
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
01:42:36.649 --> 01:42:36.659 align:start position:0%
you're gonna
 
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
um there's that night that
 
01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
perception that divers are disrupting
 
01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
the bottom and and especially during the
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
period when lobsters are more
 
01:42:48.169 --> 01:42:48.179 align:start position:0%
susceptible to Predators when they've
 
01:42:49.729 --> 01:42:49.739 align:start position:0%
just molted or
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
um when they're very young we're not
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
dragging lifting up rocks or or
 
01:42:58.490 --> 01:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
um to to find them it's a very difficult
 
01:42:58.500 --> 01:42:59.990 align:start position:0%
um to to find them it's a very difficult
challenging

01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
to find one and when you do find one you
 
01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
it it's not that easy to you don't pull
 
01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
them out by the claws you have to really
 
01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's not a sustainable method to grab
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
them by the closet there's practices
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
that um someone else will talk about on
 
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
on how to sustainably harvest lobsters
 
01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
in a way that's safe for the environment
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
um through education so those are the
 
01:43:23.689 --> 01:43:23.699 align:start position:0%
only things I wanted to bring up but
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
just lastly it's just uh that this also
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to help I think the local dive
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
shop communities the some of the dive
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
shops on the Seacoast uh like the shop
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
that I represent to to draw more uh
 
01:43:35.689 --> 01:43:35.699 align:start position:0%
people into sport which is kind of on
 
01:43:37.250 --> 01:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
the decline to get more people
 
01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:38.330 align:start position:0%
the decline to get more people
interested

01:43:38.330 --> 01:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
interested
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
but um I'll answer any questions if
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
 
01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:50.870 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
chairman

01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be safe to say that
 
01:43:56.689 --> 01:43:56.699 align:start position:0%
um hand catching a lobster is a I think
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
you acknowledge there's a less passive a
 
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
more passive way of capturing a lobster
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
and the probability of bycatch
 
01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
unlike Nets which catch numerous other
 
01:44:10.609 --> 01:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
marine species is is basically not going
 
01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
if I understand your question correct
 
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
yes it is much more Passive by by scuba
 
01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:18.770 align:start position:0%
yes it is much more Passive by by scuba
but

01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to other means which catch
 
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
by catch
 
01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
um and as a diver I see all the time
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
fish in pots they get in but they can't
 
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
get out caught and so and as a dive
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to touch the pots
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
you can look at them but there's you
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
can't let them out
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
um even lobsters get in there I know
 
01:44:41.689 --> 01:44:41.699 align:start position:0%
that smaller ones can get in and out but
 
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
reality a lot of them get in there and
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
then there's storms and the way that the
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
pot gets mangled um some of the the exit
 
01:44:49.609 --> 01:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
points are blocked
 
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
um so they're there and I see them all
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
the time as and I've seen
 
01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:57.179 align:start position:0%
uh dead lobsters and you know four pound
 
01:44:59.810 --> 01:44:59.820 align:start position:0%
Lobster that's about 40 000 eggs there's
 
01:45:01.609 --> 01:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
the rule of thumb is like I think 10 000
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
eggs per pound so you're talking when
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
you especially if it's an eggger it does
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
have an impact
 
01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
um so that's something that's to
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
consider one other thing I do this
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
organization that we brought up called
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
oceans wide I do volunteer for
 
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
um it's a non-profit in Maine and we
 
01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:21.659 align:start position:0%
actually go out and clear and look for
 
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
abandoned pots and and um you'll see
 
01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
there's a video that was sent on it pots
 
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
that we identify that are identified
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
um that get brought up they have tags
 
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
and those tags identify the owner so the
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
owner gets those pots back they're
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
contacted hey your pot was found it's
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
there if you want it come and get it if
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
you don't those that don't want them
 
01:45:42.290 --> 01:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
they usually give them to Apprentice uh
 
01:45:44.330 --> 01:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
Lobster Harvesters that are just
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:51.169 --> 01:45:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.689 --> 01:45:53.699 align:start position:0%
Madam Clerk
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I actually have two questions
 
01:45:59.090 --> 01:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
one is on a process that Committee in
 
01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
previous years had heard uh an
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
accusation that some divers catch
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
Lobster by the claw my understanding is
 
01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
that claws usually become unattached in
 
01:46:10.729 --> 01:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
that situation so I don't really know
 
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
why a diver would do that so maybe you
 
01:46:15.229 --> 01:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
can clarify what we've heard in the past
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
and and what divers actually do
 
01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:19.860 align:start position:0%
yeah they're an inexperienced diver
 
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
might be trying to get a these lobsters
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
are their tails in their back in the
 
01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
hole and the claws are out there
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
um the last thing a diver wants the last
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
thing you want to do is grab a lobster
 
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
by the clock because what will happen is
 
01:46:33.050 --> 01:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
the claw is going to come off
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
so what if that Lobster is a short or
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
egg bearing you're going to put it back
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
you can't bring it up so and and the
 
01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
other thing is that
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
as a you know when you bring up a
 
01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:45.659 align:start position:0%
Lobster Claw even if it's a legal
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
Lobster and you bring it up and it's in
 
01:46:51.050 --> 01:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
the claw it just gets bad after it has
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
to be attached by the time you get home
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
and it's just not as good so that's part
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
of it but it's really just it's not a
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
good practice to do it so
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
um through training and education there
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
are proper ways to get at it and and the
 
01:47:08.810 --> 01:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
way is you put your hand over the
 
01:47:11.450 --> 01:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
carpatch and grab it from the body but
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
and you can even tell if it's a mold
 
01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
when you're in there you'll know that oh
 
01:47:16.609 --> 01:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
it's mulch so you're not going to want
 
01:47:18.530 --> 01:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
to bring that up that just means that it
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
just recently shed its skin and it's
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
very soft and
 
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
um those aren't that means they're not
 
01:47:25.490 --> 01:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
really good lobsters to take because
 
01:47:26.930 --> 01:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
they're there's not a whole lot of meat
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
you want the ones that that are not mold
 
01:47:30.770 --> 01:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
so these are things that you can tell
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
when you're grabbing or fishing looking
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
for them as opposed to bring them up
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.639 --> 01:47:40.129 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:47:40.129 --> 01:47:40.139 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:47:41.930 --> 01:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
um also is it true that when you use a
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
boat to capture Lobster then in fact
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
there are different fish species and
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
schools of fish that have learned to
 
01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
follow the boats specifically because
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
the bycatch gets thrown off the edge and
 
01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.659 align:start position:0%
so in that water column those Lobster
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
whether they're Eggers whether they're
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
other species whatever may have been
 
01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
caught indiscriminately are not just
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
generally susceptible to Predators but
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
very specifically susceptible to the
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
Predators that have learned to follow
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
those boats absolutely you're absolutely
 
01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
correct especially striped bass which
 
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
during the season they're going after uh
 
01:48:22.850 --> 01:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
that's their one of their primary uh
 
01:48:25.609 --> 01:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
food sources yes
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:32.330 --> 01:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Ming
 
01:48:34.490 --> 01:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um
 
01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh scuba certification is that a
 
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
requirement in the state of New
 
01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is correct uh for what
 
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
for this bill divers have to be divers
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
have to be certified to to do that yes
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:48:51.169 --> 01:48:51.179 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:58.370 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
customers

01:48:58.370 --> 01:48:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
the chair now calls Ward Byrne
 
01:49:14.209 --> 01:49:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time this morning
 
01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I've already heard a lot of uh
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
good testimony from uh Mr Anderson and
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
I feel like I've heard a lot of faults
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh guesstimate scientific data that
 
01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
really is Hocus Pocus in this room
 
01:49:36.410 --> 01:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
and uh you some may find that offending
 
01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
but that's uh my experience on the water
 
01:49:42.050 --> 01:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
and no one knows the ocean better than
 
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
the guys that make the living there
 
01:49:50.689 --> 01:49:50.699 align:start position:0%
um this business of derelict gear is is
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
just not true any gear that's derelict
 
01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
is usually in Shore water and ends up on
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
Route 1 after a winter storm and it's
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
cleaned up and gone and our New
 
01:50:03.050 --> 01:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lobster industry does clean
 
01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
that up
 
01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:06.860 align:start position:0%
um I think Cherie Patterson could
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
clarify the number of tonnage of rope
 
01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
and lobster gear that is recovered by
 
01:50:14.450 --> 01:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire lobster industry and
 
01:50:17.689 --> 01:50:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
um nothing that's been brought up here
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
this morning is the potential of theft
 
01:50:27.169 --> 01:50:27.179 align:start position:0%
of a say diver that goes down and is
 
01:50:30.050 --> 01:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
come from say Pittsburgh to go diving
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
and he can't find his lobsters but he
 
01:50:36.590 --> 01:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
finds my lobster trap or traps
 
01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
watch to prevent him
 
01:50:41.149 --> 01:50:41.159 align:start position:0%
from going in my trap and taking my
 
01:50:43.850 --> 01:50:43.860 align:start position:0%
catch the answer is nothing
 
01:50:45.530 --> 01:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
because fish and games made it clear
 
01:50:47.570 --> 01:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
that they can't enforce it
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
and I we can talk about
 
01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:51.050 align:start position:0%
and I we can talk about
um

01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:53.689 --> 01:50:53.699 align:start position:0%
studies and and some of the information
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
they've given you this morning is if you
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
look at it and read it the piles of
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
traps those are from Nova Scotia not New
 
01:51:03.169 --> 01:51:03.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state waters
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
I got a brief look at them so it's
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to what happens in our Waters
 
01:51:09.119 --> 01:51:11.810 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to what happens in our Waters
okay

01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
I I feel as though as a fisherman this
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
is a huge enforcement problem
 
01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
to prevent anybody from stealing from me
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
as this is my living I have a son that's
 
01:51:24.770 --> 01:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
also a commercial fisherman
 
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
it's his living
 
01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
you know I I can understand how they
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
want to dive on the law offices and it
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
sounds fun and everything and
 
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
you could have
 
01:51:39.229 --> 01:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
10 honest fishermen Lobster fishermen
 
01:51:41.930 --> 01:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
diving and now we get another 80 out
 
01:51:44.090 --> 01:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
there that is stealing from us and I I
 
01:51:47.209 --> 01:51:47.219 align:start position:0%
have a real problem with that again I
 
01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
think fishing game is going to speak
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
heavily on this the enforcement end of
 
01:51:54.109 --> 01:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
it how it is not possible to enforce
 
01:51:57.890 --> 01:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
what goes on under the water thank you
 
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and
 
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
the chair will now call
 
01:52:09.649 --> 01:52:09.659 align:start position:0%
Grand Birch who's asked for 10 minutes
 
01:52:11.689 --> 01:52:11.699 align:start position:0%
and it says you have written testimony
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
if you would uh
 
01:52:15.770 --> 01:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
pass that into the clerk when you're
 
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
done we will make sure that gets around
 
01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.750 --> 01:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you so Mr chairman
 
01:52:57.410 --> 01:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
members of committee thank you for the
 
01:52:58.970 --> 01:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to you this morning
 
01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
my name is Graham Burch I live in Hollis
 
01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
I say that just so that you're not
 
01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
thrown by my funny accent and think that
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
I come from strange places I've lived
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
there for 26 years my wife and I have
 
01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
raised our four kids in uh in Hollis
 
01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:16.250 align:start position:0%
raised our four kids in uh in Hollis
um

01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a Avid scuba diver in my uh Spare
 
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
Time little Lloyd is and uh one of the
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
things I do is is I teach scuba diving
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm a I'm an instructor
 
01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.270 align:start position:0%
so I'm a I'm an instructor
um

01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:33.649 --> 01:53:33.659 align:start position:0%
question was asked previously about
 
01:53:36.169 --> 01:53:36.179 align:start position:0%
scuba certification I'm one of those
 
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
people who brings in an interested party
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
someone that's never been diving before
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
and trains them in the sport educates
 
01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
them and teaches them about dive safety
 
01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
and how to dive particularly in our
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
called New Hampshire Waters and be safe
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
incidentally not German to my testimony
 
01:53:58.970 --> 01:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
but as a part of that training we do
 
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
also instruct divers on how to behave
 
01:54:03.290 --> 01:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
around Lobster gear which in the state
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire currently and hopefully
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
for the foreseeable future is you steer
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
clear of it
 
01:54:10.609 --> 01:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
you can't avoid it
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
um you know we dive in waters we have a
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
visibility of around you know a good day
 
01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
10 feet
 
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
um so we're always swimming in around
 
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
the same areas that the commercial
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
lobsterman are fishing in and that
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
really brings me to the core point of my
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
testimony today and I'd like to speak
 
01:54:28.609 --> 01:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
about the important issue of safety
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
as a diver and as an instructor
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
responsible for students safety is of
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
utmost concern to me and we've heard
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:54:39.850 --> 01:54:39.860 align:start position:0%
um you know at least one I would say
 
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
hyperbole around enormous consequences
 
01:54:47.209 --> 01:54:47.219 align:start position:0%
for safety
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
I think we have to match hyperbole with
 
01:54:51.770 --> 01:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
facts and so what I'd like to give you
 
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
is four facts on the topic of safety
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
that should just put this one to bed
 
01:55:01.609 --> 01:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
so firstly
 
01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned previously divers are
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
already in the waters where lobsterman
 
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
are fishing that's where we dive we
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
don't dive off Hampton Beach where it's
 
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
Sandy because there's frankly nothing to
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
look at we die where it's Rocky that's
 
01:55:16.129 --> 01:55:16.139 align:start position:0%
where the critters are that's where it's
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
fun to dive that's where we see all the
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
amazing wildlife and that's also where
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
the lobster and fish so we co-exist and
 
01:55:26.689 --> 01:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
have been coexisting for decades with uh
 
01:55:28.609 --> 01:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
with lobsterman and as I say we swim
 
01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
Point number two
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
there are no safety
 
01:55:42.169 --> 01:55:42.179 align:start position:0%
incidents involving divers and lobster
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
gear documented anywhere in the New
 
01:55:47.810 --> 01:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
England region despite the fact that
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
we're all sharing the same waterways
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
there's nothing on
 
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
their dive related sites non-diver
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
related government websites or even the
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
widely respected divers alert Network
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
annual diving incident reports none of
 
01:56:11.450 --> 01:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
them report any safety related concerns
 
01:56:15.070 --> 01:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
or incidents involving divers and active
 
01:56:18.530 --> 01:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
lobstermen using the same Waters so
 
01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
Point number one we share the waters
 
01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
Point number two
 
01:56:23.450 --> 01:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
there's no problem
 
01:56:26.990 --> 01:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.450 --> 01:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
if if there were to be such a problem
 
01:56:31.129 --> 01:56:31.139 align:start position:0%
then we would find it probably in our
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
neighbor instead of Massachusetts
 
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
right where divers are allowed to take
 
01:56:39.709 --> 01:56:39.719 align:start position:0%
lobsters and share the same Waters with
 
01:56:42.770 --> 01:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
the lobsterman but again there are no
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
reported incidents of conflicts safety
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
related conflicts between divers and
 
01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
lobstermen so it really is it's a moot
 
01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:52.850 align:start position:0%
lobstermen so it really is it's a moot
point

01:56:52.850 --> 01:56:52.860 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
and then point number four uh there was
 
01:56:58.010 --> 01:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
a question raised about well maybe if we
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
open up lobstering to divers that would
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
bring a flood of divers into the waters
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
therefore increase in the number of
 
01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
divers therefore potentially increasing
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
the number of um of incidents
 
01:57:13.490 --> 01:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
if we look at this I think I think
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
currently the bill says something
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
recommends something like a hundred
 
01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:18.530 align:start position:0%
recommends something like a hundred
licenses

01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
so worst case scenario
 
01:57:24.169 --> 01:57:24.179 align:start position:0%
if that were to mean 100 new certified
 
01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
divers in our Waters
 
01:57:29.689 --> 01:57:29.699 align:start position:0%
that would barely bring the number of
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
divers back to the level of the number
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
of divers that were diving probably you
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
know five and ten years ago the scuba
 
01:57:39.290 --> 01:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
diving industry is is in Decline number
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
of divers are in Decline and that's
 
01:57:42.410 --> 01:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
measured by the number of dive shops
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
that have gone out of business over the
 
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
last few years and the number of boats
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
that have uh stopped running dive
 
01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:49.850 align:start position:0%
that have uh stopped running dive
charters

01:57:49.850 --> 01:57:49.860 align:start position:0%
charters
 
01:57:52.129 --> 01:57:52.139 align:start position:0%
so even if there was a small influx of
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
new divers um that will not move the
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
needle in terms of safety so that's the
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
end of my testimony I just like to
 
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
summarize and say I think there are four
 
01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
not hyperbole not arm waving
 
01:58:07.129 --> 01:58:07.139 align:start position:0%
um not what ifs just four clear facts
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
that we already share the waters there
 
01:58:11.089 --> 01:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
is no safety concern here in New
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there is no safety concern in
 
01:58:15.290 --> 01:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts where we there is such a
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
light an ability to take lobsters and
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
lastly even if there is a small growth
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
in the dive industry we wouldn't get
 
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
back to the numbers we were at a few
 
01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
years ago when we all shared the waters
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
quite safely
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for your time I'm
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madam Clerk
 
01:58:36.890 --> 01:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and thank
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
um we heard just a few minutes ago
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
testimony saying that if we allow these
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
licenses that the divers would be
 
01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
illegally stealing out of traps but as
 
01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
you just said divers are already and
 
01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
have been for decades coexisting in the
 
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
same Waters is there anything preventing
 
01:58:58.669 --> 01:58:58.679 align:start position:0%
them from stealing out of traps now what
 
01:59:00.410 --> 01:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
is what is the issue with that I don't
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
understand what's preventing that now
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
yeah what's so here's a a thin line
 
01:59:08.930 --> 01:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
what's prevented is the morality of the
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
divers and the training
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
so we uh you know we train we teach we
 
01:59:14.639 --> 01:59:16.189 align:start position:0%
so we uh you know we train we teach we
educate

01:59:16.189 --> 01:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
educate
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
um divers are very concerned for The
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
Aquatic environment
 
01:59:25.370 --> 01:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
um and absolutely concerned that the um
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know for the prosperity and the
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
longevity of the the lobstermen and
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
their uh their industry
 
01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
could you stop it 100 I wish I could say
 
01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
we could but you know what there's
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
always maybe going to be a bad apple I
 
01:59:39.290 --> 01:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
couldn't really say
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
um but do I think it will be prevalent
 
01:59:43.129 --> 01:59:43.139 align:start position:0%
not from the divers that I know or meet
 
01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
with regularly as I'm diving The Shores
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
At the weekends
 
01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:49.930 align:start position:0%
At the weekends
follow-up

01:59:49.930 --> 01:59:49.940 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:51.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:54.589 --> 01:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
um and also we heard you talk about how
 
01:59:58.010 --> 01:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
this bill does require certification I
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
am not certified In Scuba
 
02:00:02.030 --> 02:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
um my understanding it's a fairly
 
02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
expensive and involved process would
 
02:00:07.070 --> 02:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
someone can you foresee somebody going
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
through the process of becoming
 
02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:10.860 align:start position:0%
certified in order to catch an
 
02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
occasional Lobster
 
02:00:14.689 --> 02:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
just to capture the cables no it'd be
 
02:00:19.250 --> 02:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I do agree with the previous
 
02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative this is a nation on the
 
02:00:29.209 --> 02:00:29.219 align:start position:0%
presumption of innocence most people are
 
02:00:32.330 --> 02:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
good and you can't always uh create a
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
rule to prevent the Bad Apple from
 
02:00:36.770 --> 02:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
acting uh my question is
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe this is a question for the law
 
02:00:39.770 --> 02:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement Colonel that's going to
 
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
probably come up and speak but what
 
02:00:42.589 --> 02:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
would be the difference between
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
enforcing the diving for lobster and
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
saying enforcing fishing regulations
 
02:00:48.890 --> 02:00:48.900 align:start position:0%
because both of the catch have to be
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
brought up on shore of the boat where
 
02:00:52.250 --> 02:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
then Fish and Game can then conduct
 
02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
proper enforcement so I don't see the
 
02:00:56.689 --> 02:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
issue with that
 
02:00:58.850 --> 02:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's a great question
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't feel like I'm the probably
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
the right rightly qualified person to
 
02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
answer that question but it's a very
 
02:01:05.330 --> 02:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
good question
 
02:01:09.370 --> 02:01:09.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:11.450 --> 02:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:01:13.250 --> 02:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:43.490 --> 02:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
good morning excuse me Mr chairman
 
02:01:45.709 --> 02:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Geno
 
02:01:48.530 --> 02:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
Marconi and I am the chairman of the
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
advisory committee on marine fisheries
 
02:01:54.410 --> 02:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
which is established under RSA 211 colon
 
02:01:57.649 --> 02:01:57.659 align:start position:0%
60. uh the committee is made up of a
 
02:01:59.410 --> 02:01:59.420 align:start position:0%
diverse group of people
 
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
that are involved in the marine
 
02:02:05.209 --> 02:02:05.219 align:start position:0%
environment a commercial fishermen a
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
recreational fishermen chatter boat
 
02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:08.709 align:start position:0%
recreational fishermen chatter boat
fishermen

02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
fishermen
 
02:02:11.410 --> 02:02:11.420 align:start position:0%
Marine wholesale dealers
 
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
and uh we've got a pro a lot a broad
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
experience of folks on that committee
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
and I'll preface my remarks by saying
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
that last year when this bill came came
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
before the legislature the committee did
 
02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
meet with a group of divers
 
02:02:30.169 --> 02:02:30.179 align:start position:0%
uh and we had a great discussion about
 
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
it but I'm here to tell you today that
 
02:02:35.689 --> 02:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
the committee has voted unanimously to
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
oppose the taking of lobsters by scuba
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
I've handed out a letter for the sake of
 
02:02:44.450 --> 02:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
those folks behind me I'm going to keep
 
02:02:46.209 --> 02:02:46.219 align:start position:0%
it real short and sweet
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
Lobster is one of the most highly
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
regulated species in the Gulf of Maine
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
and in the state of New Hampshire and
 
02:02:56.169 --> 02:02:56.179 align:start position:0%
the regulations that we have today
 
02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
are equal to all citizens of the State
 
02:03:02.030 --> 02:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in order to harvest
 
02:03:05.689 --> 02:03:05.699 align:start position:0%
lobsters buy a method that is proven to
 
02:03:08.930 --> 02:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
be over many years of research proven to
 
02:03:11.629 --> 02:03:11.639 align:start position:0%
be protective of that species in the
 
02:03:14.450 --> 02:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
methods in which it's harvested
 
02:03:17.810 --> 02:03:17.820 align:start position:0%
um it it's on an equal basis and it's
 
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
limited to taking of lobsters by Parts
 
02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:22.010 align:start position:0%
limited to taking of lobsters by Parts
Only

02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
Only
 
02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:23.930 align:start position:0%
Only
um

02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:27.290 --> 02:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
yes there is some disparity maybe that's
 
02:03:28.850 --> 02:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
not the correct word there are some
 
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
issues with law enforcement and as
 
02:03:33.790 --> 02:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
representative Smith raised the question
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
the only time that the law enforcement
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
can Chuck these lobsters is when they're
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
brought to the surface
 
02:03:45.709 --> 02:03:45.719 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow scuba or divers or
 
02:03:48.290 --> 02:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
swimmers for that matter to possess that
 
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
Lobster it does not give away for law
 
02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement to inspect what goes on
 
02:03:57.169 --> 02:03:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
I've been around the Waterfront a long
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
time we work very closely with the fish
 
02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
and game department
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
guide digging clams you can observe them
 
02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
from the shore at a distance a guy
 
02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:10.619 align:start position:0%
hauling lobster traps you can observe
 
02:04:12.890 --> 02:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
him from a distance everything is done
 
02:04:15.770 --> 02:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
above the water The Taking of lobsters
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
under the water there's no way to
 
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
observe it maybe the Navy has technology
 
02:04:22.729 --> 02:04:22.739 align:start position:0%
to observe these things but I don't
 
02:04:29.089 --> 02:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
I would ask you again for the sake of
 
02:04:34.609 --> 02:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
brevity please please read that what the
 
02:04:37.010 --> 02:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
committee has authorized me to bring to
 
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
you I will just say one thing about
 
02:04:42.850 --> 02:04:42.860 align:start position:0%
ghost traps and that is that uh
 
02:04:44.930 --> 02:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
they do
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
do a Trap clean up every year and in my
 
02:04:51.649 --> 02:04:51.659 align:start position:0%
experience diving I have not witnessed
 
02:04:53.830 --> 02:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
big mounds of lobster traps on the ocean
 
02:04:56.570 --> 02:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
on on in the coastal Waters of New
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are out at the aisles of
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
Shoals I I've never seen it
 
02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:03.290 align:start position:0%
Shoals I I've never seen it
um

02:05:03.290 --> 02:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:06.109 --> 02:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
as far as retrieving those ghost traps
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
any person that dives that wants to be
 
02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
environmentally conscious
 
02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
should mock the location of those traps
 
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
if they see them contact contact fishing
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
game department in the fish and game
 
02:05:20.209 --> 02:05:20.219 align:start position:0%
department I'm sure would make
 
02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
plans to go and have those lobster traps
 
02:05:25.010 --> 02:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
or treat retrieved I don't think giving
 
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
someone a license to harvest the lobster
 
02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
is predicated on them being
 
02:05:32.450 --> 02:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
environmentally conscious to go find
 
02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
lost a gear again Mr chairman there are
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of other people that are more
 
02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
qualified than me to be here and I'll
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
leave it at that
 
02:05:44.689 --> 02:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%

is there currently any funding source or
 
02:05:54.290 --> 02:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
a fund available to clean up
 
02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
these straps
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
there is now yes if I may just follow up
 
02:06:02.330 --> 02:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
to that prior to that there was some
 
02:06:04.129 --> 02:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
grant money that came out of sea Grant
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
at the University of New Hampshire and
 
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
the other hat that I representative is I
 
02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:11.030 align:start position:0%
the other hat that I representative is I
do

02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
work at the Port Authority and we manage
 
02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
the facilities at Ryan Hampton and in
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
the commercial fish pier in Portsmouth
 
02:06:20.209 --> 02:06:20.219 align:start position:0%
we've contributed to that over the years
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
by providing a payment for dumpsters
 
02:06:25.370 --> 02:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
that's been our contribution to this so
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
I do see a lot of the stuff that's done
 
02:06:29.570 --> 02:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
during the Trap cleanup but there was
 
02:06:33.770 --> 02:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
that fund that was established and yes
 
02:06:35.870 --> 02:06:35.880 align:start position:0%

responding
 
02:06:40.070 --> 02:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:06:41.689 --> 02:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to make
 
02:06:45.410 --> 02:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
sure I'm clear on on the committee's
 
02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
opposition to this particular Bill uh
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're opposed to the hand collection
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
of the lobster but if a scuba diver
 
02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
wants to use the the traps or the pots
 
02:06:58.910 --> 02:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
like if the individual's a scuba diver
 
02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
they want to get a license from Fish and
 
02:07:06.589 --> 02:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
Game and go out and do the small what is
 
02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
it five whatever for a prairie season or
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you're with that but not hand
 
02:07:14.109 --> 02:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
collection which are some of the other
 
02:07:16.970 --> 02:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative there are a lot of people
 
02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
that I know that scuba dive that have
 
02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
commercial Lobster licenses but they
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
only Harvest by using lobster traps yes
 
02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
sir thank you
 
02:07:29.330 --> 02:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
Madam Clerk
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and thank
 
02:07:32.810 --> 02:07:32.820 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question just to be
 
02:07:34.129 --> 02:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
very clear I want the committee's
 
02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
objection is to the enforcement or
 
02:07:39.410 --> 02:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
enforceability of this it's not that
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the enforceability in
 
02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
terms of the legal Lobster itself is
 
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
unenforceable because that can be
 
02:07:49.370 --> 02:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
observed above water so am I right in
 
02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
understanding that the objection is to
 
02:07:54.530 --> 02:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
the idea that take that specifically the
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
idea of divers stealing out of traps is
 
02:07:58.370 --> 02:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
the part that you find to be
 
02:07:58.380 --> 02:08:00.589 align:start position:0%
the part that you find to be
unenforceable

02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
unenforceable
 
02:08:02.930 --> 02:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
the harvesting of the creature
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
underwater we believe is unenforceable
 
02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
The Possession anyone anyone in
 
02:08:11.570 --> 02:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
possession of a lobster if I if I go to
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
Walmart and I buy a lobster out of the
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
tank and I'm walking out the door and I
 
02:08:18.050 --> 02:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
run into the game wide in the parking
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
lot and we're shooting the breeze and my
 
02:08:22.070 --> 02:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
bag Falls open and he looks at the
 
02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
lobster and he sees wow that doesn't
 
02:08:27.169 --> 02:08:27.179 align:start position:0%
it's got eggs on it that's a violation
 
02:08:29.089 --> 02:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
state law possession and I could be
 
02:08:29.099 --> 02:08:30.050 align:start position:0%
state law possession and I could be
wrong

02:08:30.050 --> 02:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:08:33.129 --> 02:08:33.139 align:start position:0%
Colonel if if
 
02:08:36.530 --> 02:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
it's illegal to possess a lobster that
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet the specification set forth
 
02:08:42.050 --> 02:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:43.609 --> 02:08:43.619 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid I don't think that answered
 
02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:47.639 align:start position:0%
my question my question is
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
which thing are we talking about it's
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
being unenforceable because if Fish and
 
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
Game can Patrol any other species above
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
the water including Lobster so they can
 
02:09:00.770 --> 02:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
enforce the in terms of the lobster
 
02:09:03.649 --> 02:09:03.659 align:start position:0%
being a legal take the right size not
 
02:09:05.689 --> 02:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
neggar Etc that's already that that
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
would be enforceable under this but
 
02:09:10.490 --> 02:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
specifically your committee is objecting
 
02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
to the enforceability of stealing from
 
02:09:15.229 --> 02:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
traps the method in which it's harvested
 
02:09:18.109 --> 02:09:18.119 align:start position:0%
which could include poaching from
 
02:09:21.410 --> 02:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
 
02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
chairman I just want to follow up on rep
 
02:09:30.169 --> 02:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
Reed's comments again
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
we need to not lose that the presumption
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
of innocence most people are good and
 
02:09:35.810 --> 02:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
they're out there doing their daily
 
02:09:38.930 --> 02:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
lives in a honorable way I just want to
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
compare the idea of catching Lobster by
 
02:09:43.370 --> 02:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
hand on the water it's no different than
 
02:09:45.649 --> 02:09:45.659 align:start position:0%
a hunter I hunt I hike eight ten miles
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
through the back Woods fishing game
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
cannot watch everything I do every day
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
as I hunt people harvest deer every day
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
outside of the site a fishing game so
 
02:09:56.330 --> 02:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
the idea that someone's swimming for
 
02:09:58.970 --> 02:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
lobster and catching catching capturing
 
02:09:58.980 --> 02:09:59.750 align:start position:0%
lobster and catching catching capturing
them

02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:10:02.570 --> 02:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
without the eyes of fishing game on that
 
02:10:05.629 --> 02:10:05.639 align:start position:0%
action is is just not a good comparison
 
02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives their question there do
 
02:10:10.250 --> 02:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
you yes do you believe that it's any
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
different harvesting lobster under the
 
02:10:13.729 --> 02:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
water than it is for a hunter harvesting
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
a deer in the back of the mountains
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
where there are no fish and game present
 
02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
I think those are two scenarios that
 
02:10:23.330 --> 02:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
cannot be compared I think there's
 
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
difference day and night that's my
 
02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:27.890 align:start position:0%
difference day and night that's my
opinion

02:10:27.890 --> 02:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
02:10:30.530 --> 02:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:10:32.209 --> 02:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:35.629 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
question

02:10:35.629 --> 02:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
how are you I'm doing well sir nice to
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
see you nice to be seen
 
02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
see you nice to be seen
um

02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:43.609 --> 02:10:43.619 align:start position:0%
you may not be the person to answer this
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
but because you have this Association
 
02:10:48.109 --> 02:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
maybe you have a feel for it uh I think
 
02:10:51.290 --> 02:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
uh Graham Burch mentioned that he
 
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't believe that
 
02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
scuba diving interferes with lobstering
 
02:10:58.490 --> 02:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
as a general rule
 
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
um if you add some amount of scuba
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
divers to a lobstering area do you think
 
02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
that that's true
 
02:11:09.290 --> 02:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
would you agree that the lobstering
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
community would say that scuba divers
 
02:11:16.370 --> 02:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
any comment to that representative would
 
02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
be is
 
02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
um there's a reason why the lobster
 
02:11:22.490 --> 02:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
traps it is that's because that's what
 
02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:31.310 --> 02:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you sir and thank you
 
02:11:38.270 --> 02:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:50.990 --> 02:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.689 --> 02:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
hello my name is David Coyle one of our
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
aquatic Specialties Merrimack New
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the reason I got involved in
 
02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
this was because
 
02:12:03.609 --> 02:12:03.619 align:start position:0%
I dive a lot I teach about 100
 
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
certifications a year I'm involved with
 
02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
the diving community and
 
02:12:11.089 --> 02:12:11.099 align:start position:0%
my father was a lobsterman I'm in
 
02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
construction it's not an easy business
 
02:12:14.689 --> 02:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
we're not here to take their livelihood
 
02:12:17.330 --> 02:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
it's just that when I take out students
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm diving and I see Lobster pots
 
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
and I see animals inside that I cannot
 
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
touch their Lobster Pot I can't remove
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
that animal because it is unlawful to do
 
02:12:29.450 --> 02:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
so I'm the people that I'm the person
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
talking to them and explaining that to
 
02:12:31.679 --> 02:12:32.510 align:start position:0%
talking to them and explaining that to
them

02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:12:35.089 --> 02:12:35.099 align:start position:0%
and I I come to these meetings and I
 
02:12:36.890 --> 02:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
feel that there's an embossity against
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
the lobster men and the divers we need
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
to change that not every diver is out
 
02:12:43.550 --> 02:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
there going out and stealing lobsters
 
02:12:45.890 --> 02:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
we're out there every weekend I was out
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
last weekend we're diving with four
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
people we're diving out because we want
 
02:12:51.169 --> 02:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
to take pictures we want to see things
 
02:12:54.290 --> 02:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
we want to improve our Waters we have
 
02:12:57.470 --> 02:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
created a lot of ecology programs that
 
02:13:00.910 --> 02:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
are helping educate and
 
02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
awareness and that's what I like to do
 
02:13:05.149 --> 02:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
about this is I like to help educate and
 
02:13:08.209 --> 02:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
aware that is that not every diver out
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
there is out there because I'm diving
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
next to a Lobster Pot and I have a buoy
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
they can see my buoy go and buy their
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
buoys that I am stealing their lobster
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
pots wouldn't it be better to have a
 
02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
system in place that we can monitor it I
 
02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
have a program that I've created it's
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
called the weed control diver and this
 
02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
is just basically the program of what
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
the class is the weed control diver is a
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
class that we take to be able to remove
 
02:13:38.569 --> 02:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
milfoil correctly in New Hampshire it's
 
02:13:41.149 --> 02:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
been working for a number of years there
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
is a sign up sheet when you can take the
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
class there is student material for them
 
02:13:47.810 --> 02:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
to be able to take this is my PowerPoint
 
02:13:50.810 --> 02:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
presentation there's a test in there we
 
02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
can have all of the education that is
 
02:13:57.290 --> 02:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
concerned for divers that are out there
 
02:13:59.330 --> 02:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
if we were to take lobsters so that's
 
02:14:01.250 --> 02:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
what's got me involved in this is is
 
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
that I would like to help educate people
 
02:14:07.010 --> 02:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
that are diving and make sure that if we
 
02:14:08.689 --> 02:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
are going to create something that we're
 
02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
doing it properly this is my concern
 
02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:13.790 align:start position:0%
doing it properly this is my concern
okay

02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:16.729 --> 02:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
um the um I just I I feel there's a lot
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
of emosity between the two and I think
 
02:14:21.290 --> 02:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
that that should be relieved and I think
 
02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
by having it being legal and having them
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
come back and actually show your catch
 
02:14:29.689 --> 02:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
and being able to you know you say you
 
02:14:31.970 --> 02:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
can't see it underwater but have a
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
um a way that we can Market it we can
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
take a print a picture or we have a
 
02:14:38.689 --> 02:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
station that just like when we're
 
02:14:40.970 --> 02:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
hunting for deer right or you're hunting
 
02:14:43.069 --> 02:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
for anything you have a station that you
 
02:14:44.990 --> 02:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
have to take it to it I'm happy to work
 
02:14:46.609 --> 02:14:46.619 align:start position:0%
with Fish and Game to be able to create
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
a program to be able to have that in
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
place we already have something that
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
works with the weed control diver and I
 
02:14:54.649 --> 02:14:54.659 align:start position:0%
think that's something that we could do
 
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
to change the future for New Hampshire
 
02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:59.149 align:start position:0%
to change the future for New Hampshire
Waterworks

02:14:59.149 --> 02:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
Waterworks
 
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:15:08.569 --> 02:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
is that a handout for us or this is my
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
whole program what I did is I just
 
02:15:11.569 --> 02:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
printed the whole thing off so that you
 
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
could be able to see it if you can give
 
02:15:14.569 --> 02:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
that to the clerk we'll have copies made
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you okay yeah it was too much for
 
02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:22.609 align:start position:0%
thank you okay yeah it was too much for
everybody

02:15:22.609 --> 02:15:22.619 align:start position:0%

and I first of all I'd like to preface
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
my testimony here by saying that I
 
02:15:59.810 --> 02:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
crafted this testimony before there were
 
02:16:02.089 --> 02:16:02.099 align:start position:0%
any amendments to
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh this bill so I'm going to continue
 
02:16:07.729 --> 02:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
and please bear with me
 
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%

sustainable resources that still exists
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's not by accident
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
we don't harvest the small lobsters we
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
protect The Brood stock by not taking
 
02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
the large ones
 
02:16:58.370 --> 02:16:58.380 align:start position:0%

if a trap is lost
 
02:17:23.330 --> 02:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
the biodegradable event will over time

and what will return to the ocean we do
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
so alive
 
02:17:35.810 --> 02:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
we'll reduce risk to marine mammals
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
through closures weak lines and other
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%

02:17:47.570 --> 02:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
the basic design except for resource

friendly modifications has not changed
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
in over 100 years
 
02:17:56.030 --> 02:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
the Trap fishery is opportunistic
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
lobsters are not forced to enter
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
they only enter when they want to
 
02:18:04.190 --> 02:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
when they are mating bedding or inactive
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
they are not forced into a trap
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
in addition the lobster fishery of this
 
02:18:13.009 --> 02:18:13.019 align:start position:0%
state contributes millions of dollars to

commercial and recreational alike
 
02:18:22.429 --> 02:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
including recreational hook and line
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
fishermen and boaters we occasionally
 
02:18:28.009 --> 02:18:28.019 align:start position:0%
lose gear to Mother Nature
 
02:18:30.830 --> 02:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
we have for years cleaned the coast of
 
02:18:32.929 --> 02:18:32.939 align:start position:0%

02:18:32.939 --> 02:18:35.030 align:start position:0%

ashore
 
02:18:37.129 --> 02:18:37.139 align:start position:0%
we have also discouraged the abandonment
 
02:18:39.530 --> 02:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
of and non-tending of lobster gear
 
02:18:41.929 --> 02:18:41.939 align:start position:0%
through laws and penalties
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
if our gear and nothing of fishing is
 
02:18:47.690 --> 02:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the resource it would be
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
hard to explain why the largest resource
 
02:18:52.429 --> 02:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
in the Gulf of Maine is the healthiest
 
02:18:56.030 --> 02:18:56.040 align:start position:0%

like everywhere they are only effective

with compliance and enforcement
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
there are no laws they're effective

without these two components
 
02:19:39.530 --> 02:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
to try to tie the hands of law
 
02:19:42.349 --> 02:19:42.359 align:start position:0%

it's important to remember that federal
 
02:19:56.270 --> 02:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
waters is just a lie on a chart
 
02:19:58.910 --> 02:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
the fishermen in this case are New

02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%

mandatory reporting by federally

02:20:33.469 --> 02:20:33.479 align:start position:0%

the implications of this kind of

02:20:48.530 --> 02:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
unwarranted
 
02:20:50.510 --> 02:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
as a member of the Atlantic Lodge whale
 
02:20:52.849 --> 02:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
take reduction team I and the other
 
02:20:55.010 --> 02:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
members other New Hampshire members on
 
02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
that team have spent hundreds of hours
 
02:21:00.349 --> 02:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
in the last year working to reduce risk
 
02:21:02.809 --> 02:21:02.819 align:start position:0%
to right whales by 90 percent
 
02:21:04.670 --> 02:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
while being sure that New Hampshire
 
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
lobster Fisher remains intact for the
 
02:21:09.650 --> 02:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
current and future Generations
 
02:21:12.830 --> 02:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
that has not been an easy task not when
 
02:21:14.809 --> 02:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
the neighbors our neighbors want to
 
02:21:17.150 --> 02:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
reduce our traps by 50 and close our
 
02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
fishery for five months a year
 
02:21:23.090 --> 02:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
in these negotiations compliance
 
02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
enforcement is always of great concern
 
02:21:29.570 --> 02:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
if I go to the trt and say these rules
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
are all well and good but New Hampshire
 
02:21:32.690 --> 02:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
is not going to enforce them
 
02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
the results would be catastrophic
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
Under The Marine Mammal protection act
 
02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
and The Endangered Species Act The
 
02:21:42.349 --> 02:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
Fishery in this state could be shut down
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
as simple as that
 
02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
and for those who say it can't happen
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
let me assure you it can happen and has
 
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
happened in other states
 
02:21:53.090 --> 02:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
as for the diving part of this bill I
 
02:21:55.070 --> 02:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
will leave that to the others except to
 
02:21:59.809 --> 02:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
say that under G in the proposed bill
 
02:21:59.819 --> 02:22:01.450 align:start position:0%
say that under G in the proposed bill
uh

02:22:01.450 --> 02:22:01.460 align:start position:0%

02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
oh wait we have one menu recognized
 
02:22:55.550 --> 02:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
um Mr nut I was just hoping you could
 
02:23:00.170 --> 02:23:00.180 align:start position:0%
give us a snapshot of the lobster
 
02:23:02.210 --> 02:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
industry in New Hampshire who are the
 
02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
smallest who are the biggest what's the
 
02:23:04.439 --> 02:23:06.010 align:start position:0%
smallest who are the biggest what's the
average

02:23:06.010 --> 02:23:06.020 align:start position:0%
average
 
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm sorry I don't hear very
 
02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:10.190 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm sorry I don't hear very
well

02:23:10.190 --> 02:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:23:12.349 --> 02:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
yes I was hoping you could give give us
 
02:23:14.750 --> 02:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
a snapshot of what the lobster industry
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
looks like in New Hampshire
 
02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
what do the smallest outfits look like
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
what do the big operations look like
 
02:23:26.570 --> 02:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
again I didn't get I'm sorry I didn't
 
02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
he's asking you
 
02:23:37.130 --> 02:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
um if you could please provide a
 
02:23:38.929 --> 02:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
snapshot of what the industry looks like
 
02:23:41.270 --> 02:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for lobstering
 
02:23:44.210 --> 02:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
um what what is the size of a small
 
02:23:45.830 --> 02:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
operation what are the largest
 
02:23:47.570 --> 02:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
operations like and what's a typical
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
operation or an average one in the state
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the lobster fishery in the
 
02:23:56.150 --> 02:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
State uh is an owner for the most part
 
02:23:58.370 --> 02:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
actually it is they're all that I can
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
remember is an owner operator uh Fishery
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's relatively small the majority of
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
fishermen in this state fish 600 or less
 
02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:09.710 align:start position:0%
fishermen in this state fish 600 or less
traps

02:24:09.710 --> 02:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
traps
 
02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:10.910 align:start position:0%
traps
um

02:24:10.910 --> 02:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:13.370 --> 02:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
the range of the fishery in state waters
 
02:24:15.849 --> 02:24:15.859 align:start position:0%
obviously is in state waters
 
02:24:19.309 --> 02:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
there are uh
 
02:24:22.969 --> 02:24:22.979 align:start position:0%
portion of the state fishermen who have
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
federally permitted vessels
 
02:24:28.130 --> 02:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's a small fishery compared to other
 
02:24:34.370 --> 02:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
states compared to other states uh the
 
02:24:35.570 --> 02:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
size of the boat
 
02:24:37.849 --> 02:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
uh probably is
 
02:24:39.710 --> 02:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
half the size
 
02:24:42.110 --> 02:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
and we have a very large fishery a very
 
02:24:44.929 --> 02:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
large portion of our fishery is
 
02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
very small boat fishery retired people
 
02:24:51.050 --> 02:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
that fish are only a handful of traps
 
02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:57.050 --> 02:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question
 
02:24:59.690 --> 02:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you that does thank you
 
02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
 
02:25:03.420 --> 02:25:06.950 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
much

02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:11.210 --> 02:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:13.130 --> 02:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
does not say whether you support or
 
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:24.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:27.170 --> 02:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
my name's uh Bill Marconi
 
02:25:29.330 --> 02:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh I've been fishing lobstering for 50
 
02:25:29.340 --> 02:25:30.290 align:start position:0%
uh I've been fishing lobstering for 50
years

02:25:30.290 --> 02:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
in 100 of my income is Lobster's that's
 
02:25:33.359 --> 02:25:35.150 align:start position:0%
in 100 of my income is Lobster's that's
it

02:25:35.150 --> 02:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
um you guys talk about safety
 
02:25:40.250 --> 02:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
it's safe it is a problem it's a problem
 
02:25:44.270 --> 02:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
now I fish uh in the river along the
 
02:25:46.730 --> 02:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
shore all the way up to
 
02:25:49.270 --> 02:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
boy's head in
 
02:25:51.770 --> 02:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
there's times you got to really watch
 
02:25:52.849 --> 02:25:52.859 align:start position:0%
what you're doing
 
02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
and it you know we see the dive Flags
 
02:25:59.210 --> 02:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
yeah we be careful but
 
02:26:01.969 --> 02:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
in the summertime
 
02:26:04.330 --> 02:26:04.340 align:start position:0%
when we're fishing along the shore
 
02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
we're all trying to get the same spot
 
02:26:08.450 --> 02:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
because the lobsters are in certain
 
02:26:11.929 --> 02:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
places so we're tight our trolls a tight
 
02:26:13.490 --> 02:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
to each other without getting on each
 
02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:14.389 align:start position:0%
to each other without getting on each
other

02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:26:18.770 --> 02:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
so what I'm saying is it's a very busy
 
02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
place and now if you have a diver in
 
02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:23.590 align:start position:0%
place and now if you have a diver in
there

02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I'm worried I mean on
 
02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:26.990 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I'm worried I mean on
weekends

02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
weekends
 
02:26:30.650 --> 02:26:30.660 align:start position:0%
in the last 10 or 15 years this area is
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
off of Newcastle I don't I try not to
 
02:26:35.090 --> 02:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
haul there on Saturday or Sunday I try
 
02:26:37.250 --> 02:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
to haul on Friday there because of the
 
02:26:39.710 --> 02:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
boat traffic you got boat traffic now
 
02:26:40.730 --> 02:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
you've got
 
02:26:44.210 --> 02:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
possible divers it I'm surprised nobody
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
no one's gotten hurt yet
 
02:26:50.570 --> 02:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
so I think the die the safety thing
 
02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
is is going to be a problem the
 
02:26:54.889 --> 02:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
enforcement I mean that's obvious
 
02:26:58.010 --> 02:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
I mean you think about it I mean if I'm
 
02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
a diver you know a diver could be down
 
02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
there he ain't seeing no lobsters and
 
02:27:04.010 --> 02:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
there's my trap and there's you know
 
02:27:06.349 --> 02:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
Jesus it's nice one there
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
game one is can't prevent that from
 
02:27:10.490 --> 02:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
happening you know I mean I know there
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
could be good ones and bad ones but it's
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
awful tempting
 
02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:16.790 align:start position:0%
awful tempting
uh

02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:19.070 --> 02:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
in you know that one of the divers said
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
this you know they see a lot of Eggers
 
02:27:22.910 --> 02:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
and stuff yeah he sees a lot of Eggers
 
02:27:24.770 --> 02:27:24.780 align:start position:0%
we're mocking these lobsters we're
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
farming these things
 
02:27:28.849 --> 02:27:28.859 align:start position:0%
we've been we've been we get a lot so a
 
02:27:31.849 --> 02:27:31.859 align:start position:0%
shot Lobster with eggs on it we mock it
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
put a notch in the tail we throw it back
 
02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
that loss is protected
 
02:27:37.849 --> 02:27:37.859 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of them yeah well because
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
what what we're produced we're making
 
02:27:40.670 --> 02:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
02:27:43.730 --> 02:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
so what we our traps have vents in them
 
02:27:45.650 --> 02:27:45.660 align:start position:0%
for all the little ones get out and then
 
02:27:49.070 --> 02:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
the bio event the the Trap gets lost it
 
02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
I have to put new uh steel uh hog rings
 
02:27:56.090 --> 02:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
in every like eight nine months they
 
02:27:58.490 --> 02:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
brushed out and if I don't the the the
 
02:28:01.070 --> 02:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
the these bio events open up the
 
02:28:03.230 --> 02:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
everything gets out of that trap so we
 
02:28:06.349 --> 02:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
try to keep up on it ghost gear there's
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
no there's no lobsters in them if I find
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
a a lost trap it's the vents flapping as
 
02:28:14.929 --> 02:28:14.939 align:start position:0%
though there's nothing in there
 
02:28:17.090 --> 02:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
and they you know people were talking
 
02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:18.050 align:start position:0%
and they you know people were talking
about

02:28:18.050 --> 02:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
um you know going nice to grab a lobster
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know underneath a rock and stuff
 
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
well that's that's the natural bottom we
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
have the last thing you probably want to
 
02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
do is start lifting rocks and moving
 
02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
stuff I mean that's the natural thing we
 
02:28:34.969 --> 02:28:34.979 align:start position:0%
have we have here
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
in in a natural way to catch a lopsis in
 
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
a trap you know
 
02:28:42.590 --> 02:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
and somebody mentioned 10 percent of
 
02:28:46.010 --> 02:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
gear is lost every year
 
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know about that I fished 1200
 
02:28:52.370 --> 02:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
traps if I lost 120 traps my traps are
 
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
150 at 175 dollars a piece that's a lot
 
02:28:56.570 --> 02:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
of money
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
so this lost gear thing you know we if
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
we lose a trap we lose gear we grapple
 
02:29:05.330 --> 02:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
them up you know we we don't just oh I
 
02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
lost it forget about it it's just too
 
02:29:08.690 --> 02:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
much money there's a lot of money in
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
this business we've put in you know I've
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
I've been doing it my son now is doing
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
it and you know we've built this whole
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
state has built a nice a nice business
 
02:29:21.469 --> 02:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
and we're farming these lobsters we're
 
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
not you know the way we're doing it it's
 
02:29:26.570 --> 02:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
producing you know future losses for
 
02:29:28.610 --> 02:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
future fishermen
 
02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
in and they want to do April April we a
 
02:29:34.130 --> 02:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
lot of guys set out in April
 
02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's beginning of the season for a lot
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
of guys
 
02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
in in we fish along the shore April to
 
02:29:42.110 --> 02:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
September a lot of guys are fishing
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
right along the shore where the divers
 
02:29:46.250 --> 02:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
are going to be you know so
 
02:29:46.260 --> 02:29:47.510 align:start position:0%
are going to be you know so
um

02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:50.570 --> 02:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
in my other thought was
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
this state has a license for anybody can
 
02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
catch a lot it can buy fire traps
 
02:29:57.770 --> 02:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
anybody can do it and it can be
 
02:30:00.290 --> 02:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
inexpensive if you want it to be I I see
 
02:30:01.610 --> 02:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
a lot of people
 
02:30:03.889 --> 02:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
take their boats on the weekends to psi
 
02:30:05.210 --> 02:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
when they put the boat in the water they
 
02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
have five traps they go out and haul the
 
02:30:08.929 --> 02:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
traps and have fun and they and they're
 
02:30:10.370 --> 02:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
not just to get their offices and
 
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
everybody's happy and in that way the
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
game the game one is going to force it
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
they can see what they're doing
 
02:30:18.770 --> 02:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:21.469 --> 02:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
um it's about all I have
 
02:30:25.490 --> 02:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madam Clerk
 
02:30:27.410 --> 02:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and thank
 
02:30:29.929 --> 02:30:29.939 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question my question
 
02:30:32.030 --> 02:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
is I heard a little bit of conflicting
 
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
information on the one hand you said if
 
02:30:38.030 --> 02:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's divers now going to catch
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
Lobster that that would present an extra
 
02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
security problem or a safety problem
 
02:30:45.650 --> 02:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
rather but you prefaced all of that by
 
02:30:48.410 --> 02:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
saying that you run into the divers all
 
02:30:50.210 --> 02:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
the time you see their Flags it's a very
 
02:30:52.849 --> 02:30:52.859 align:start position:0%
crowded busy place to use your words I
 
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
know because I had to type them so
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
um so if you're already running into so
 
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
many and encountering so many divers I
 
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
don't understand you can you explain to
 
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
me how having some of those divers
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
license to take Lobster by hand presents
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
an increased security or science keeps
 
02:31:12.410 --> 02:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
saying security safety problem
 
02:31:14.809 --> 02:31:14.819 align:start position:0%
yeah because you're going to have more
 
02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
divers right where the lobster gear is
 
02:31:18.889 --> 02:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
that's I mean if you're diving for
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
lobsters you're going to go with will we
 
02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
go and you're going to have more of them
 
02:31:23.870 --> 02:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
around us
 
02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
and it's it's gonna it's a safety thing
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
I mean the last thing I want to do is
 
02:31:30.170 --> 02:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
you know run you know run one of these
 
02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
guys over
 
02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:33.230 align:start position:0%
guys over
um

02:31:33.230 --> 02:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:35.809 --> 02:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers that I don't know if
 
02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
it did or not but thank you
 
02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:39.889 align:start position:0%
it did or not but thank you
representative

02:31:39.889 --> 02:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:31:42.410 --> 02:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:31:44.809 --> 02:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
um my question is I had heard
 
02:31:46.250 --> 02:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
um Through the Grapevine
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
somebody had mentioned to me that
 
02:31:52.370 --> 02:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
lobstering companies and people may have
 
02:31:56.270 --> 02:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
some sort of insurance on their gear and
 
02:31:59.750 --> 02:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
it could be implied that sometimes
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
there could be incentive for those two
 
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
who need more gear to lose the old gear
 
02:32:07.370 --> 02:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
so that the insurance could cover New
 
02:32:10.490 --> 02:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
Gear I don't know I have no experience
 
02:32:12.349 --> 02:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
in the lobstering industry I don't know
 
02:32:14.270 --> 02:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
if this insurance exists if it only
 
02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
exists for people who can pay it
 
02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect here or what have you I
 
02:32:22.270 --> 02:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to know if you had any insight on
 
02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
how much that kind of claim has bearings
 
02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
in reality for insurances to sort of
 
02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:31.929 align:start position:0%
in reality for insurances to sort of
have

02:32:31.929 --> 02:32:31.939 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:32:35.570 --> 02:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
lobsters incentivized to lose their gear
 
02:32:35.580 --> 02:32:37.190 align:start position:0%
lobsters incentivized to lose their gear
yeah

02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:32:39.770 --> 02:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not aware of any in any
 
02:32:39.780 --> 02:32:41.030 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not aware of any in any
insurance

02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know for for this I mean I have boat
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
insurance but uh as far as gear
 
02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
insurance I I'm not aware of it
 
02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine
 
02:32:54.650 --> 02:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
what that would even entail well like I
 
02:32:54.660 --> 02:32:56.389 align:start position:0%
what that would even entail well like I
say

02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:33:01.730 --> 02:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
you know my I my traps 150 a piece and
 
02:33:03.290 --> 02:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
this isn't something that you you're
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
careless about
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
I lose it I mean if we spend hours
 
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
grappling for gear if we lose one it's
 
02:33:14.090 --> 02:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
not like you lose it and forget about it
 
02:33:15.770 --> 02:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
no I don't think
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's the the ghost
 
02:33:19.490 --> 02:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
gears out there like everybody thinks
 
02:33:22.730 --> 02:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
there is any gear along the shore that
 
02:33:25.250 --> 02:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
every spring we have a spring cleanup
 
02:33:28.490 --> 02:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
and we and we pick them up no gear stays
 
02:33:31.389 --> 02:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
the ocean gets so rough no gas stays
 
02:33:34.730 --> 02:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
lost along the shore
 
02:33:38.270 --> 02:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ford thank you
 
02:33:40.250 --> 02:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for coming down
 
02:33:42.889 --> 02:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
you said 100 of your income is from this
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
job and I appreciate you taking the time
 
02:33:47.330 --> 02:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
to come speak with us today about it
 
02:33:49.969 --> 02:33:49.979 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about the time
 
02:33:52.250 --> 02:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
frame in which the licenses could be out
 
02:33:54.050 --> 02:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
and divers can be in
 
02:33:55.730 --> 02:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
um in your opinion do you think a short
 
02:33:58.190 --> 02:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
amount of time or a more specific time
 
02:34:01.550 --> 02:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
would be adequate for the safety issues
 
02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:02.510 align:start position:0%
would be adequate for the safety issues
because

02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:34:05.389 --> 02:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
um as representative Reed said stated
 
02:34:07.130 --> 02:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
um you know there's lots of people out
 
02:34:09.469 --> 02:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
there and I too are thinking about those
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
who of us who hibernate in the winter
 
02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:13.140 align:start position:0%
and only come out when it's really warm
 
02:34:15.290 --> 02:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
out those months that are listed in the
 
02:34:16.910 --> 02:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
bill would be the time that a lot of
 
02:34:18.889 --> 02:34:18.899 align:start position:0%
people are just out near the water in
 
02:34:22.250 --> 02:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
general swimming just out by the beach
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
scuba divers your work
 
02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
um is there what in your opinion do you
 
02:34:28.190 --> 02:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
think a shorter amount of time for a
 
02:34:30.530 --> 02:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
scuba divers to be out there would be
 
02:34:32.510 --> 02:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
helpful or
 
02:34:34.849 --> 02:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
um be a good modification yeah
 
02:34:36.770 --> 02:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
02:34:40.849 --> 02:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
like I said April a lot of the guys are
 
02:34:43.309 --> 02:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
setting out and
 
02:34:46.010 --> 02:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
there's no there's gear along that show
 
02:34:48.530 --> 02:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
people we people catch lobsters along
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
that Shore right up until you know
 
02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:52.190 align:start position:0%
that Shore right up until you know
Christmas

02:34:52.190 --> 02:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
Christmas
 
02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:52.910 align:start position:0%
Christmas
um

02:34:52.910 --> 02:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:55.490 --> 02:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
even longer but I'm just saying in that
 
02:34:58.809 --> 02:34:58.819 align:start position:0%
time frame that's a there's a lot of it
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
so the commercial a lot of guys have
 
02:35:03.889 --> 02:35:03.899 align:start position:0%
efficient along that Shore I mean it's
 
02:35:06.650 --> 02:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
if the lobsters if the losses are there
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
you're not going to leave you know I
 
02:35:12.110 --> 02:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
mean so if his loss is there we're going
 
02:35:14.929 --> 02:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that really helped
 
02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:17.210 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that really helped
you

02:35:17.210 --> 02:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
but I mean it helped me understand the
 
02:35:22.010 --> 02:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
issue thank you I appreciate it thank
 
02:35:24.650 --> 02:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
you representative Brown
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman take my
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
question I'll follow up I want to ask
 
02:35:30.770 --> 02:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
chairman Marconi maybe you can answer
 
02:35:30.780 --> 02:35:32.510 align:start position:0%
chairman Marconi maybe you can answer
this

02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:35:34.730 --> 02:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
do you foresee that
 
02:35:37.250 --> 02:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
there will be more divers in the area
 
02:35:39.050 --> 02:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
where you're working and then that will
 
02:35:41.210 --> 02:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
make your day less productive because
 
02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
you have to wait until they're out of
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
the way is it this area that's a great
 
02:35:49.490 --> 02:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
question there's areas by the mouth of
 
02:35:51.770 --> 02:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
the harbor that I get a holy haul there
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
at slack water
 
02:35:55.550 --> 02:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
the tide runs so high to pull the buoys
 
02:35:55.560 --> 02:35:56.750 align:start position:0%
the tide runs so high to pull the buoys
under

02:35:56.750 --> 02:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:35:58.849 --> 02:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
the last thing I want to do is I got
 
02:36:00.889 --> 02:36:00.899 align:start position:0%
probably a two and a half hour time
 
02:36:03.230 --> 02:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
frame to get so much gear Haul is wait
 
02:36:05.809 --> 02:36:05.819 align:start position:0%
for a diver to come up
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it could present a problem
 
02:36:11.450 --> 02:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up and and maybe this is a
 
02:36:15.590 --> 02:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
comment more than a question
 
02:36:17.809 --> 02:36:17.819 align:start position:0%
the divers have that same time frame to
 
02:36:19.610 --> 02:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
work because of the title effects right
 
02:36:22.610 --> 02:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
or unless maybe even I don't know I'm
 
02:36:24.830 --> 02:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
assuming I'm assuming I don't know what
 
02:36:27.290 --> 02:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
what it's I I'm not a diver okay so I I
 
02:36:29.690 --> 02:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
can't answer that
 
02:36:32.450 --> 02:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
02:36:34.670 --> 02:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
Madam Clark
 
02:36:36.410 --> 02:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking another question
 
02:36:40.010 --> 02:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
you mentioned grappling for lost gear
 
02:36:41.450 --> 02:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
um I guess it's a bit of a two-part
 
02:36:44.690 --> 02:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
question when you grapple for lost gear
 
02:36:46.370 --> 02:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
um I presume you have a pretty good
 
02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
indication of where those traps are and
 
02:36:50.809 --> 02:36:50.819 align:start position:0%
so you know where to Grapple and
 
02:36:53.469 --> 02:36:53.479 align:start position:0%
secondly is dragging a grapple hook
 
02:36:57.170 --> 02:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
damaging to the the floor
 
02:37:00.170 --> 02:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
yeah we know exactly where the traps are
 
02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
the GPS systems we have now are are real
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
accurate so normally uh we can throw the
 
02:37:09.770 --> 02:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
hook over and make a couple of passes
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
and get it the hook that we have is a
 
02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
small uh hook that would would is
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
designed to to snag a rope so I don't
 
02:37:21.770 --> 02:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
believe it's it's you ruining the bottom
 
02:37:24.410 --> 02:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
there again
 
02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
we don't lose that much gear Mo all
 
02:37:29.809 --> 02:37:29.819 align:start position:0%
these guys behind me we all we fish on a
 
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
regular basis we don't
 
02:37:34.190 --> 02:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
we keep up on our buoys we keep up on
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
everything so it's not like none of
 
02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
these guys are just going to leave gear
 
02:37:40.490 --> 02:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
in the water everybody's everybody's uh
 
02:37:42.889 --> 02:37:42.899 align:start position:0%
conscious of what we're doing
 
02:37:44.750 --> 02:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
02:37:48.170 --> 02:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you the chair
 
02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:56.270 --> 02:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
hope I pronounced that right
 
02:37:58.730 --> 02:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
you did request 10 minutes I hope that
 
02:38:01.969 --> 02:38:01.979 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time we can do it a
 
02:38:03.410 --> 02:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
little less than that
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:30.770 --> 02:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Jim tatone I'm
 
02:38:33.410 --> 02:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
from Seabrook
 
02:38:36.410 --> 02:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'm here today on behalf of the more
 
02:38:38.690 --> 02:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
than 60 members of the Yankee
 
02:38:42.170 --> 02:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
Fisherman's co-op in Seabrook who are in
 
02:38:46.370 --> 02:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 442.
 
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh lobsters are a finite resource now
 
02:38:52.490 --> 02:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
that's not a statement I made up that
 
02:38:55.130 --> 02:38:55.140 align:start position:0%
was come right from our own lead Lobster
 
02:38:58.190 --> 02:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
science scientist Josh colony who works
 
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
02:39:02.770 --> 02:39:02.780 align:start position:0%
So based upon that
 
02:39:05.690 --> 02:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
sustainability of this Lobster resources
 
02:39:07.730 --> 02:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
of Paramount importance
 
02:39:10.490 --> 02:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
lobsterman understand this and
 
02:39:12.889 --> 02:39:12.899 align:start position:0%
lobsterman are going to do what they
 
02:39:15.290 --> 02:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
need to do to keep this
 
02:39:18.650 --> 02:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
fishery this resource sustainable in
 
02:39:21.170 --> 02:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
order to continue their livelihoods now
 
02:39:22.849 --> 02:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of research conducted
 
02:39:22.859 --> 02:39:23.570 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of research conducted
about

about
 
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%

um Josh kaloni of the New Hampshire
 
02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
fishing game as well as a Dr Robert
 
02:39:36.650 --> 02:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
stennick the University of Maine's
 
02:39:39.710 --> 02:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
Lobster Institute have conducted a lot
 
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
of research and determined that the
 
02:39:44.270 --> 02:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
lobster trap is the main source of food
 
02:39:47.830 --> 02:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
supply for the lobsters
 
02:39:52.190 --> 02:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
and also Dr stenick said with this in
 
02:39:52.200 --> 02:39:53.270 align:start position:0%
and also Dr stenick said with this in
mind

02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:39:56.650 --> 02:39:56.660 align:start position:0%
the lobster trap fishery is the largest
 
02:40:00.050 --> 02:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
aquaculture process in the world because
 
02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
basically we're spending a lot of money
 
02:40:04.130 --> 02:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
on bait
 
02:40:06.050 --> 02:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
the bait in the traps is attracting the
 
02:40:08.809 --> 02:40:08.819 align:start position:0%
lobsters the lapses eat they can get out
 
02:40:11.570 --> 02:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
96 percent of the lobsters to get into a
 
02:40:13.969 --> 02:40:13.979 align:start position:0%
trap Escape
 
02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
so we're only catching basically four
 
02:40:18.230 --> 02:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
percent of the lobsters
 
02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:19.849 align:start position:0%
percent of the lobsters
now

02:40:19.849 --> 02:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:40:22.730 --> 02:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
on the thing of cost of bait
 
02:40:25.550 --> 02:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
last year debate is very expensive last
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
year one third of my gross Lobster
 
02:40:30.530 --> 02:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
income went to the expenditure of bait
 
02:40:33.889 --> 02:40:33.899 align:start position:0%
and all this is like an investment in
 
02:40:36.830 --> 02:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
this resource to keep it healthy
 
02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
scuba taking the Lobsters by scuba
 
02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
diving does not contribute to the
 
02:40:44.750 --> 02:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the resource
 
02:40:47.690 --> 02:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
there's no investment by divers to keep
 
02:40:50.389 --> 02:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
this resource healthy
 
02:40:52.309 --> 02:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
the other thing we've got there's a big
 
02:40:54.050 --> 02:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
storm coming up here in the lobster
 
02:40:57.349 --> 02:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
industry right now The Landings are good
 
02:40:59.870 --> 02:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's the Calm before the storm
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
Dr Richard Wally who is the director of
 
02:41:03.889 --> 02:41:03.899 align:start position:0%
the lobster Institute for the state of
 
02:41:07.010 --> 02:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
Maine in 1989 he came he devised this
 
02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
sampling system where they go around
 
02:41:11.870 --> 02:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
sample the amount of juvenile lobsters
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
that are actually settling to the bottom
 
02:41:17.570 --> 02:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
right now there's approximately 62
 
02:41:20.809 --> 02:41:20.819 align:start position:0%
sampling sites from Newfoundland and
 
02:41:22.429 --> 02:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
Canada all the way down to Long Island
 
02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
where they sample the amount of juvenile
 
02:41:26.809 --> 02:41:26.819 align:start position:0%
lobsters that are settling to the bottom
 
02:41:29.450 --> 02:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
and because of the global global warming
 
02:41:31.550 --> 02:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
conditions the Gulf of Maine is warming
 
02:41:34.190 --> 02:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
faster than any other body of water on
 
02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:35.270 align:start position:0%
faster than any other body of water on
Earth

02:41:35.270 --> 02:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
Earth
 
02:41:38.210 --> 02:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
and this warming water is affecting the
 
02:41:41.150 --> 02:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
ability of the juveniles to survive in
 
02:41:43.070 --> 02:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
order to settle to the bottom
 
02:41:47.630 --> 02:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
in 2021 there was a 23 percent decline
 
02:41:49.849 --> 02:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
in the number of juvenile warpses that
 
02:41:50.990 --> 02:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
settled to the bottom of the ocean
 
02:41:52.610 --> 02:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
02:41:56.570 --> 02:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
23 from the year prior
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
the concern here is that and I'm going
 
02:42:02.030 --> 02:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
to quote Josh colony from the fish and
 
02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:02.750 align:start position:0%
to quote Josh colony from the fish and
game

02:42:02.750 --> 02:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
game
 
02:42:06.170 --> 02:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
if consecutive years of poor juvenile
 
02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
recruitment occur
 
02:42:10.969 --> 02:42:10.979 align:start position:0%
decline in the number of juvenile oh
 
02:42:12.349 --> 02:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
wait a minute it could it could
 
02:42:14.809 --> 02:42:14.819 align:start position:0%
dramatically impact the sustainability
 
02:42:17.330 --> 02:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
of the lobster population this is
 
02:42:19.250 --> 02:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
actually happening well offices don't
 
02:42:22.010 --> 02:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
become legal until between five and
 
02:42:25.010 --> 02:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
seven years so this storm was not
 
02:42:26.690 --> 02:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
hitting now it's going to be hitting in
 
02:42:30.110 --> 02:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
the future so here we are talking about
 
02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
allowing an activity that does not
 
02:42:34.610 --> 02:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
contribute to the sustainability of the
 
02:42:38.330 --> 02:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
lobster resource to allow them to take
 
02:42:40.849 --> 02:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
our resource and not provide any
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
investment in this
 
02:42:44.570 --> 02:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
now we've I've heard a lot of
 
02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
conversation this morning about
 
02:42:49.550 --> 02:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
ghost gear and how much uh that that's
 
02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:51.290 align:start position:0%
ghost gear and how much uh that that's
affected

02:42:51.290 --> 02:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
affected
 
02:42:54.349 --> 02:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
I I've been fishing for over 50 years
 
02:42:57.290 --> 02:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
and over that period of time I've seen a
 
02:42:58.790 --> 02:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff going on out in the ocean
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
I've had traps ghost traps come up
 
02:43:04.849 --> 02:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
entangled in my gear and on one occasion
 
02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
have I've seen
 
02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
a lobster in any of these ghost traps
 
02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
that have come up the biodegradable
 
02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
Escape vents are effective they are
 
02:43:14.399 --> 02:43:16.490 align:start position:0%
Escape vents are effective they are
working

02:43:16.490 --> 02:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:43:18.710 --> 02:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
the enforcement part of it that's been
 
02:43:21.830 --> 02:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
hashed out here we can observe any
 
02:43:23.750 --> 02:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
violations that could be occurring above
 
02:43:25.849 --> 02:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
the surface of the water we have
 
02:43:28.130 --> 02:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
visibility from not only fish and game
 
02:43:30.349 --> 02:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
but from other fishermen
 
02:43:32.570 --> 02:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
if there's another fisherman here
 
02:43:34.730 --> 02:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
see somebody messing around with my gear
 
02:43:37.130 --> 02:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
they're going to alert me to that so we
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
have more than fish and game alerting
 
02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
people to the possibilities of
 
02:43:42.770 --> 02:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
violations above the surface of the
 
02:43:42.780 --> 02:43:43.730 align:start position:0%
violations above the surface of the
water

02:43:43.730 --> 02:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
water
 
02:43:46.429 --> 02:43:46.439 align:start position:0%
below the surface of the water there's
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
there's no enforcement no
 
02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
certain times of the year I'm fishing
 
02:43:54.889 --> 02:43:54.899 align:start position:0%
really tight in in in coastal Waters I
 
02:43:56.809 --> 02:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
mean sometimes less than 10 feet of
 
02:43:56.819 --> 02:43:57.530 align:start position:0%
mean sometimes less than 10 feet of
water

02:43:57.530 --> 02:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
water
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
and I've had traps rated by divers
 
02:44:03.710 --> 02:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
a friend of mine who passed away a few
 
02:44:05.630 --> 02:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
years ago Bob Littlefield one of the
 
02:44:09.290 --> 02:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
highliners he would fish uh Place coven
 
02:44:11.270 --> 02:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampton pretty steadily and he
 
02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
continuously had problems with divers so
 
02:44:16.130 --> 02:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
to try to eliminate the issue of divers
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
getting into his traps he hog-ringed his
 
02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
doors shut to prevent them from being
 
02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:21.830 align:start position:0%
doors shut to prevent them from being
open

02:44:21.830 --> 02:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
open
 
02:44:23.630 --> 02:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
but what's happening with the divers
 
02:44:26.809 --> 02:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
they were slicing the twine hinges on
 
02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
his traps folding his doors open and
 
02:44:31.849 --> 02:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
then slicing the heads in the traps to
 
02:44:35.090 --> 02:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
get access to his lopsis so it did
 
02:44:37.250 --> 02:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
definitely a problem with traps being
 
02:44:40.130 --> 02:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
rated because the lobster trap is the
 
02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
main source of supply for the lobsters
 
02:44:44.990 --> 02:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
so lops is basically hang out in and
 
02:44:47.270 --> 02:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
around traps it'd be very tempting if
 
02:44:48.650 --> 02:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
you're not finding lobsters in their
 
02:44:50.809 --> 02:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
natural habitat the best place to find
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
them is in a trap
 
02:44:56.809 --> 02:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
now one other thing about this bill this
 
02:44:58.969 --> 02:44:58.979 align:start position:0%
language in there that states the
 
02:45:02.050 --> 02:45:02.060 align:start position:0%
executive director is going to set aside
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
protected zones
 
02:45:06.889 --> 02:45:06.899 align:start position:0%
for the activity of scuba dime for
 
02:45:09.170 --> 02:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
lobsters what I interpret this to mean
 
02:45:11.710 --> 02:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
is this zone is going to be protected
 
02:45:14.990 --> 02:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
strictly for the diving activity so
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
basically grounds that I have
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
traditionally fished I may be shut out
 
02:45:21.650 --> 02:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
of for an activity that's not
 
02:45:24.110 --> 02:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
contributing to the sustainability of
 
02:45:26.990 --> 02:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
this this resource and this just isn't
 
02:45:29.570 --> 02:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
right another issue I've heard been
 
02:45:32.510 --> 02:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
hearing is that the cost of Entry
 
02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room
 
02:45:38.210 --> 02:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
can exploit the lobster resource but
 
02:45:41.870 --> 02:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
what we ask is that it be exploited in a
 
02:45:43.550 --> 02:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
manner that's sustainable and that's
 
02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
through the Trap fishery the cost of
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
entry for diving which I've researched
 
02:45:51.410 --> 02:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
is comparable to what it would take to
 
02:45:53.809 --> 02:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
purchase a boat motor and trailer so it
 
02:45:58.690 --> 02:45:58.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:01.730 --> 02:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
exploit the resource through the Trap
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
fishery and again
 
02:46:07.309 --> 02:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
I I don't think this is I don't believe
 
02:46:09.530 --> 02:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
that we should allow
 
02:46:11.570 --> 02:46:11.580 align:start position:0%

in the taking of these lobsters so
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony if anybody's any
 
02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
questions I'll be more than happy that
 
02:46:28.429 --> 02:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%

the chair calls Sherry Patterson
 
02:46:40.550 --> 02:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
you've requested 10 minutes if you could
 
02:46:55.130 --> 02:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
and Colonel Jordan I have your card two
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
are you going to be testifying jointly
 
02:47:02.690 --> 02:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
you can be yeah I think that'll be
 
02:47:04.250 --> 02:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
easier then I'll take your card out of
 
02:47:05.929 --> 02:47:05.939 align:start position:0%
the pile and give it right here
 
02:47:07.610 --> 02:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that'll help with
 
02:47:10.849 --> 02:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.250 --> 02:47:13.260 align:start position:0%

state's most valuable commercial fishery

than 330 licensed commercial Harvesters
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
certain economic models suggest the
 
02:47:53.450 --> 02:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
overall contribution to New Hampshire's
 
02:47:55.610 --> 02:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
economy is likely three to four times
 
02:47:59.630 --> 02:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
that amount to roughly 102 to 136

million dollars
 
02:48:04.550 --> 02:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
as such this is a highly regular

this is not conducted in a vacuum we

states that have American lobster
 
02:48:38.630 --> 02:48:38.640 align:start position:0%

marine fisheries commissions 2020
 
02:48:54.650 --> 02:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
Lobster stock assessment raised concerns
 
02:48:56.809 --> 02:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
over reduced young of year recruitment
 
02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
in recent years since 2012 recruitment
 
02:49:02.809 --> 02:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
throughout much of the Gulf of Maine has
 
02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
shown sustained low levels which could
 
02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
translate to reduced stock in the
 
02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
fishery in coming years
 
02:49:12.290 --> 02:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
currently New Hampshire Law requires
 
02:49:14.690 --> 02:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
that all Harvesters of lobsters in their

method of harvest the lobster trap
 
02:49:24.650 --> 02:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
every resident in New Hampshire can
 
02:49:26.750 --> 02:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
purchase a license to harvest lobsters
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
in the state including recreational
 
02:49:32.690 --> 02:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
Harvesters via the Open Access five trap
 
02:49:35.690 --> 02:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
license I've actually seen people in
 
02:49:40.550 --> 02:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
kayaks fishing traps recreationally
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
this legislation is not about providing
 
02:49:45.770 --> 02:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
access to a user group for recreational
 
02:49:48.050 --> 02:49:48.060 align:start position:0%

02:49:50.690 --> 02:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
harvesting lobster for personal use can
 
02:49:52.730 --> 02:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
obtain a recreational Lobster Harvest
 
02:49:55.610 --> 02:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
license to harvest buy traps make it
 
02:49:58.730 --> 02:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
uniform throughout the fishery
 
02:50:01.250 --> 02:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
the department has four major concerns
 
02:50:03.650 --> 02:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
about House Bill 442
 
02:50:06.469 --> 02:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
it's a new Harvest method during a time
 
02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
when there is a grease in the young of
 
02:50:10.910 --> 02:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
the Year population and sustainability
 
02:50:13.610 --> 02:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
of the lobster population in the Gulf of
 
02:50:15.650 --> 02:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
Maine is in question
 
02:50:18.170 --> 02:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
just to give you guys a heads up right
 
02:50:20.090 --> 02:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
now the Atlantic states marine fisheries
 
02:50:21.969 --> 02:50:21.979 align:start position:0%
commission is meeting
 
02:50:25.510 --> 02:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
to discuss about a sustainability
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
issue with
 
02:50:30.410 --> 02:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
American lobster and there will likely
 
02:50:33.349 --> 02:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
be additional fishery management plan
 
02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
regulations moving forward
 
02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:43.309 --> 02:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
there's also climate degradation of
 
02:50:46.130 --> 02:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
marine habitat warming Waters is the
 
02:50:49.370 --> 02:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
main issue the increase in user
 
02:50:53.270 --> 02:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
conflicts and enforcement concerns so I
 
02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
have asked Colonel Jordan to sit next to
 
02:50:58.849 --> 02:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
me to address those enforcement concerns
 
02:51:00.469 --> 02:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
a little later
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
the lobster trap is a passive capture
 
02:51:05.330 --> 02:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
device and rules have been implemented
 
02:51:07.130 --> 02:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
regarding trap construction that
 
02:51:09.110 --> 02:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
minimize their impact on the lobster
 
02:51:12.110 --> 02:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
resource such as traps are required to
 
02:51:14.150 --> 02:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
have a statements at a size to allow
 
02:51:18.530 --> 02:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
Juvenile and sub-legal lobster to escape
 
02:51:21.770 --> 02:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
it prevents excessive handling of
 
02:51:24.170 --> 02:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
sub-legals they're not in the Trap when
 
02:51:26.870 --> 02:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
they get pulled up the Harvesters are
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
just handling the legals for the most
 
02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:29.809 align:start position:0%
just handling the legals for the most
part

02:51:29.809 --> 02:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
part
 
02:51:32.690 --> 02:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
the biodegradable Escape panels that are
 
02:51:35.270 --> 02:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
designed to degrade over time to allow
 
02:51:37.370 --> 02:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
escapement of lobster
 
02:51:41.510 --> 02:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
if it traps our loss due to storms
 
02:51:43.690 --> 02:51:43.700 align:start position:0%
um due to
 
02:51:46.670 --> 02:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
other vessel traffic that cuts lines
 
02:51:50.809 --> 02:51:50.819 align:start position:0%
those sort of issues arise with
 
02:51:53.030 --> 02:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
loss of gear
 
02:51:56.030 --> 02:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
while track Trap Fishing is a passive
 
02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
form of capture for example the lobsters
 
02:52:02.769 --> 02:52:02.779 align:start position:0%
crawl into the baited traps on their own
 
02:52:05.870 --> 02:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
captured by scuba diving is an active
 
02:52:07.849 --> 02:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
form that involves grabbing and at times
 
02:52:07.859 --> 02:52:09.530 align:start position:0%
form that involves grabbing and at times
chasing

02:52:09.530 --> 02:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
chasing
 
02:52:12.349 --> 02:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
lean Lobster to capture it a lobster
 
02:52:14.630 --> 02:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
will sometimes shed one or both claws
 
02:52:16.849 --> 02:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
during this active form of capture in an
 
02:52:19.490 --> 02:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
attempt to escape scuba divers will
 
02:52:21.530 --> 02:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
encounter and handle numerous short
 
02:52:24.410 --> 02:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
Underside lobsters for each legal size
 
02:52:26.809 --> 02:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
Lobster they encounter and while
 
02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
lobsters will eventually regenerate the
 
02:52:30.889 --> 02:52:30.899 align:start position:0%
Lost clause
 
02:52:33.469 --> 02:52:33.479 align:start position:0%
there is a cumulative short time loss
 
02:52:36.170 --> 02:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
for desired Harvest from both the
 
02:52:37.670 --> 02:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
recreational and the commercial
 
02:52:40.849 --> 02:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
standpoint in addition newly molted soft
 
02:52:43.550 --> 02:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
shell lobsters hide under rocks for
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
several weeks until their shells have
 
02:52:47.750 --> 02:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
hardened and would be vulnerable to this
 
02:52:49.790 --> 02:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
kind of handling which you have heard
 
02:52:52.190 --> 02:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
from the diving community
 
02:52:55.429 --> 02:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
a newly malted Lobster body is literally
 
02:52:58.130 --> 02:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
softest Jello when handled could sustain
 
02:53:00.349 --> 02:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
severe life-threading life-threatening
 
02:53:03.290 --> 02:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
damage to its internal organs
 
02:53:05.690 --> 02:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
I'd like to provide some insight as to
 
02:53:07.429 --> 02:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
why we feel it is important for New
 
02:53:09.290 --> 02:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to continue to limit Lobster
 
02:53:12.170 --> 02:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
harvested traps only while our states to
 
02:53:14.450 --> 02:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
the South do allow Harvest by other
 
02:53:17.090 --> 02:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
message methods including scuba diving
 
02:53:19.849 --> 02:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
we the states of Massachusetts and Rhode
 
02:53:21.590 --> 02:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
Island are the two states that do allow
 
02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:23.090 align:start position:0%
Island are the two states that do allow
it

02:53:23.090 --> 02:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:53:25.070 --> 02:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
um ma'am if you could um
 
02:53:27.950 --> 02:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
sort of give given a overview because we
 
02:53:29.870 --> 02:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
have the we have the copy of the letter
 
02:53:31.309 --> 02:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
in front of us so you don't need to read
 
02:53:32.809 --> 02:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
the whole thing and in the interest of
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
time we do have one other person who's
 
02:53:38.510 --> 02:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
asked to testify and so we will read
 
02:53:40.190 --> 02:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
your letter if you could just cover the
 
02:53:42.290 --> 02:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
Salient points that you'd like us to
 
02:53:44.929 --> 02:53:44.939 align:start position:0%
know about thank you
 
02:53:48.170 --> 02:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
um so essentially we'd like to limit the
 
02:53:51.769 --> 02:53:51.779 align:start position:0%
Harvest of lobsters to trap to traps as
 
02:53:55.490 --> 02:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
this is management measures that we have
 
02:53:58.550 --> 02:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations that we understand
 
02:54:02.690 --> 02:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
do conserve and maintain the
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
sustainability of
 
02:54:08.389 --> 02:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
the lobster population thank you
 
02:54:10.670 --> 02:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to turn it over to Colonel
 
02:54:14.450 --> 02:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
Jordan for the enforcement aspect
 
02:54:16.790 --> 02:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
so couple things uh well more than a
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
couple probably but I didn't bring the
 
02:54:20.929 --> 02:54:20.939 align:start position:0%
bill so shame on you guys for bringing
 
02:54:20.939 --> 02:54:22.130 align:start position:0%
bill so shame on you guys for bringing
it

02:54:22.130 --> 02:54:22.140 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:54:25.010 --> 02:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
so a couple things
 
02:54:26.690 --> 02:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
um when we talk about access for
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
resource we've heard that a lot today
 
02:54:30.290 --> 02:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
about people deserving access for
 
02:54:32.450 --> 02:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
resource quite frankly we limit that on
 
02:54:34.309 --> 02:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
everything we do I think everyone should
 
02:54:36.110 --> 02:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
have access to shoot a moose if they so
 
02:54:38.330 --> 02:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
desire but we don't allow for that I
 
02:54:40.190 --> 02:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
think people should be allowed maybe to
 
02:54:42.590 --> 02:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
chase a deer using using a drone we
 
02:54:46.070 --> 02:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't allow for that we limit take and
 
02:54:48.769 --> 02:54:48.779 align:start position:0%
opportunity regularly we do it it's our
 
02:54:50.750 --> 02:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
regular course of business and we do it
 
02:54:53.510 --> 02:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
in an effort to not to punish people but
 
02:54:56.510 --> 02:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
to manage these resources and I'll let
 
02:54:58.730 --> 02:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
the resources speak for how well that's
 
02:55:01.370 --> 02:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
worked I think I'm very confident when I
 
02:55:02.750 --> 02:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
sit here and tell you that we're doing a
 
02:55:04.250 --> 02:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
good job because there's a lot of
 
02:55:07.010 --> 02:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
resources the lobster industry is a 34
 
02:55:09.769 --> 02:55:09.779 align:start position:0%
million dollar industry to New Hampshire
 
02:55:12.290 --> 02:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
please don't mess that up that's a very
 
02:55:13.610 --> 02:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
important amount of money coming into
 
02:55:16.490 --> 02:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and the other
 
02:55:18.050 --> 02:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
thing that I want to say about diving is
 
02:55:20.510 --> 02:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
diving is allowed in two states not the
 
02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
whole Eastern Seaboard two states for
 
02:55:24.230 --> 02:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
American lobsters that would be Rhode
 
02:55:26.330 --> 02:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
Island and Massachusetts I've talked to
 
02:55:28.429 --> 02:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
the to the Chiefs in both those States
 
02:55:31.250 --> 02:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
both regret allowing that and I know why
 
02:55:32.750 --> 02:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
I could have answered that question
 
02:55:34.250 --> 02:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
without a phone call to them because
 
02:55:36.650 --> 02:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
they face the same challenges we do so
 
02:55:39.290 --> 02:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
the issue becomes enforcement I
 
02:55:41.330 --> 02:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
obviously can't put a diver down to
 
02:55:43.090 --> 02:55:43.100 align:start position:0%
watch these guys taking
 
02:55:45.530 --> 02:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
lobsters under the water so the argument
 
02:55:47.690 --> 02:55:47.700 align:start position:0%
is made well how do you watch a lobster
 
02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
fisherman doing it well we watch him
 
02:55:51.170 --> 02:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
because we can literally see him take
 
02:55:54.230 --> 02:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
those lobsters out of the ocean in the
 
02:55:56.389 --> 02:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
Trap they caught it in I can then go up
 
02:55:58.610 --> 02:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
and inspect the Trap we restrict and
 
02:56:01.490 --> 02:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
regulate very strictly how that trap is
 
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
designed and what they're allowed to
 
02:56:04.490 --> 02:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
take the size of the lobster I'm
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
literally watching that come out of the
 
02:56:08.630 --> 02:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
ground out of the water the way it was
 
02:56:10.429 --> 02:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
trapped I'm not going to see that and a
 
02:56:13.790 --> 02:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
diver I've made three diving cases when
 
02:56:15.290 --> 02:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
I worked down on the coast for a short
 
02:56:17.809 --> 02:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
period of time illegal diving cases the
 
02:56:20.450 --> 02:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
first case is one and and I will agree
 
02:56:22.190 --> 02:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
with with representative Smith not
 
02:56:23.690 --> 02:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
everybody is a criminal thank goodness
 
02:56:25.849 --> 02:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
but I'm here to tell you I've been doing
 
02:56:27.590 --> 02:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
this for 32 years and I haven't been
 
02:56:28.849 --> 02:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
drinking coffee
 
02:56:30.830 --> 02:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
so there is an element out there that
 
02:56:32.450 --> 02:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
are going to cross that line whether we
 
02:56:35.150 --> 02:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
like it or not they will and and an
 
02:56:36.769 --> 02:56:36.779 align:start position:0%
invite they don't put out this crew
 
02:56:38.570 --> 02:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't these types of people don't put
 
02:56:40.190 --> 02:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
out dive Flags they don't announce
 
02:56:42.290 --> 02:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
they're there they just go out and and
 
02:56:44.090 --> 02:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
do their business and the first one that
 
02:56:46.190 --> 02:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
I ever got I thought was incredibly
 
02:56:48.290 --> 02:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
smart in that he brought up legal dot
 
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
legal lobsters a couple of them in a bag
 
02:56:52.969 --> 02:56:52.979 align:start position:0%
and then he came up and I was with a
 
02:56:54.830 --> 02:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
wise old Warden Who convinced me to wait
 
02:56:57.170 --> 02:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
rather than go approach him and then we
 
02:56:59.090 --> 02:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
watched him go back once he was sure the
 
02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
coast was clear and he recovered the bag
 
02:57:03.050 --> 02:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
of the big bag of illegal lobsters that
 
02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
he had caught they're not going to come
 
02:57:05.990 --> 02:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
up the first time with a bunch of
 
02:57:07.849 --> 02:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
illegal lobsters they're not that dumb
 
02:57:09.290 --> 02:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
they're going to come up and look around
 
02:57:10.730 --> 02:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
and make sure that the ghost is clear
 
02:57:12.050 --> 02:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
and then they're going to go back these
 
02:57:14.450 --> 02:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
are the these are the way this is the
 
02:57:16.130 --> 02:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
way that these some of these people no
 
02:57:17.990 --> 02:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
one in this room none of these divers
 
02:57:20.450 --> 02:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
behind me are going to be the problem I
 
02:57:21.769 --> 02:57:21.779 align:start position:0%
can assure you they're they're
 
02:57:23.809 --> 02:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
upstanding individuals I've met with
 
02:57:26.809 --> 02:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
them we've talked about this but I
 
02:57:30.130 --> 02:57:30.140 align:start position:0%
cannot disagree with a single fisherman
 
02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
I'm begging you not to be naive enough
 
02:57:35.450 --> 02:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
to think that a diver is not going to
 
02:57:37.730 --> 02:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
raid a lobster troll they are absolutely
 
02:57:39.250 --> 02:57:39.260 align:start position:0%
going to do that
 
02:57:41.750 --> 02:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
those lobsters are there it's easy for
 
02:57:43.070 --> 02:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
the picking and we're going to have some
 
02:57:44.630 --> 02:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
who do that now the problem with that is
 
02:57:46.309 --> 02:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
a lobster Fishman is going to complain
 
02:57:47.870 --> 02:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
about that to me and I'm going to be
 
02:57:50.450 --> 02:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
pretty powerless to prove it and when
 
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
you go into a core courtroom you got to
 
02:57:54.410 --> 02:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
be able to prove where those lobsters
 
02:57:56.690 --> 02:57:56.700 align:start position:0%
came from I've got to have evidence to
 
02:57:58.790 --> 02:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
present to the judge other than a short
 
02:58:01.190 --> 02:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
Lobster that's simple or or a bag
 
02:58:03.410 --> 02:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
bearing Lobster I can do that but I'm
 
02:58:05.570 --> 02:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be powerless my guys are
 
02:58:07.790 --> 02:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
going to be powerless to do the method
 
02:58:09.050 --> 02:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
of take there's just no way they're
 
02:58:10.429 --> 02:58:10.439 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do that because I'm
 
02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
not going to put them down in scuba
 
02:58:14.389 --> 02:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
suits I can't do it I I don't have the
 
02:58:16.550 --> 02:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
people to do that
 
02:58:19.309 --> 02:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
um the the uh resource or the or the
 
02:58:20.690 --> 02:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
argument that they don't have access to
 
02:58:22.309 --> 02:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
the resource it's a forty dollar license
 
02:58:24.469 --> 02:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
to buy a five trap I agree with shree
 
02:58:25.730 --> 02:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
I've seen people out there in small
 
02:58:27.230 --> 02:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
boats I don't know about you folks but I
 
02:58:28.910 --> 02:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
buy dive equipment I do it pretty
 
02:58:30.830 --> 02:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
regularly for my dive team I can assure
 
02:58:32.450 --> 02:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
you it cost me in excess of forty
 
02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
dollars I've got to certify those guys
 
02:58:36.650 --> 02:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
the tanks and Regulators of 500 a dive
 
02:58:38.389 --> 02:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
suit I just bought some there were
 
02:58:40.550 --> 02:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
fourteen hundred dollars a piece I would
 
02:58:42.290 --> 02:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
argue that it's probably cheaper to get
 
02:58:43.969 --> 02:58:43.979 align:start position:0%
a lobster trap license than it would be
 
02:58:46.130 --> 02:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
to die for them the other thing that was
 
02:58:49.730 --> 02:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned was was guiding for lobsters I
 
02:58:51.469 --> 02:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
want you to understand there is no
 
02:58:54.950 --> 02:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
currently no regulations regarding dive
 
02:58:57.889 --> 02:58:57.899 align:start position:0%
guides we don't regulate them in any
 
02:59:00.530 --> 02:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
shape manner reform we do fishing guides
 
02:59:01.730 --> 02:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
we do hunting guys we don't have
 
02:59:04.010 --> 02:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
anything to do with with diving guides
 
02:59:06.110 --> 02:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
so that's all things that we'd have to
 
02:59:07.849 --> 02:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
look at and looking at the list in this
 
02:59:09.769 --> 02:59:09.779 align:start position:0%
bill there's an awful lot of stuff that
 
02:59:11.929 --> 02:59:11.939 align:start position:0%
has to be put into place in the 60 days
 
02:59:14.330 --> 02:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
window that we've been given before the
 
02:59:16.490 --> 02:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
law becomes effective all concerns of
 
02:59:21.590 --> 02:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
mine my final concern is on page two and
 
02:59:24.410 --> 02:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
I'm arguing or debating the the original
 
02:59:24.420 --> 02:59:25.849 align:start position:0%
I'm arguing or debating the the original
bill

02:59:25.849 --> 02:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:59:28.670 --> 02:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh page two starting at line four no
 
02:59:30.290 --> 02:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
person shall at any time take any
 
02:59:34.490 --> 02:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
Lobsters by any method except by hand
 
02:59:37.130 --> 02:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
that is the worst way to do this you've
 
02:59:39.469 --> 02:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
heard testimony by that it is the worst
 
02:59:41.809 --> 02:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
way to take a lobster this law is
 
02:59:44.450 --> 02:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
allowing that the way it's written and
 
02:59:46.309 --> 02:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
then it goes on to say you can use a
 
02:59:48.410 --> 02:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
tickle stick they'll be permitted but it
 
02:59:50.510 --> 02:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't require that and if it did
 
02:59:52.670 --> 02:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
require a tickle stick I'd be anxious to
 
02:59:54.290 --> 02:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
find out from anyone in the room how I'd
 
02:59:55.849 --> 02:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
enforce that how would I know if they
 
02:59:57.530 --> 02:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
took it with a tickle stick you always
 
02:59:59.870 --> 02:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
get people come up and testify to how
 
03:00:01.610 --> 03:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
easy law enforcement would be in this
 
03:00:04.490 --> 03:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
but remember one thing these are people
 
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
that have never done law enforcement
 
03:00:09.230 --> 03:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
or they wouldn't be testifying like that
 
03:00:11.450 --> 03:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
so I'd encourage you to ride with us
 
03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
I'll show you how we do it what's
 
03:00:16.250 --> 03:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
required any other method of take I can
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
witness with a spotting scope a set of
 
03:00:20.510 --> 03:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
binoculars an undercover officer I can
 
03:00:22.370 --> 03:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
watch it I'm not going to be able to
 
03:00:23.990 --> 03:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
watch this this is going to happen under
 
03:00:25.550 --> 03:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
the water and they're going to get away
 
03:00:26.929 --> 03:00:26.939 align:start position:0%
with whatever they're doing under the
 
03:00:29.690 --> 03:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
water and I I just and the final thing I
 
03:00:31.070 --> 03:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
want to leave you with and I don't want
 
03:00:33.590 --> 03:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
to insult anybody here but I've been
 
03:00:35.389 --> 03:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
coming over here for 10 years this bill
 
03:00:37.370 --> 03:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
has been back I think this is the sixth
 
03:00:37.380 --> 03:00:38.570 align:start position:0%
has been back I think this is the sixth
time

03:00:38.570 --> 03:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:00:41.389 --> 03:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
when a bill comes back six times
 
03:00:43.070 --> 03:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
and when a bill comes back and is
 
03:00:44.450 --> 03:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
completely gutted with three different
 
03:00:46.849 --> 03:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
amendments it's usually because the
 
03:00:49.670 --> 03:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
first idea wasn't a very good one that's
 
03:00:52.130 --> 03:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
my take on that I'd ask you to consider
 
03:00:55.429 --> 03:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:00.110 --> 03:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:02.990 --> 03:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:01:04.870 --> 03:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
taking the questions
 
03:01:07.250 --> 03:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
Colonel first I want to thank you for
 
03:01:09.230 --> 03:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
answering the question I had which was
 
03:01:11.150 --> 03:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with how you would determine
 
03:01:12.650 --> 03:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
03:01:15.349 --> 03:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
an individual took a lobster by hand in
 
03:01:17.330 --> 03:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
water that we heard from testimony
 
03:01:19.010 --> 03:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
earlier that in New Hampshire on the
 
03:01:20.750 --> 03:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
coast you can only see pretty much 10
 
03:01:23.030 --> 03:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
feet in so I think that's pretty hard to
 
03:01:27.050 --> 03:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
determine but my question goes to
 
03:01:29.809 --> 03:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
on page one
 
03:01:33.950 --> 03:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:35.990 --> 03:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what the definition of
 
03:01:38.389 --> 03:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
protected zone is
 
03:01:41.090 --> 03:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
well that's undetermined I think I think
 
03:01:45.110 --> 03:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
you could I think that opens it up for a
 
03:01:46.370 --> 03:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
bunch of different things to happen I
 
03:01:48.889 --> 03:01:48.899 align:start position:0%
think a predict I assumed and it's an
 
03:01:50.809 --> 03:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
assumption but I assume the idea of that
 
03:01:53.090 --> 03:01:53.100 align:start position:0%
was and I'll and I'll applaud the lot
 
03:01:55.130 --> 03:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
the diving Community for trying to come
 
03:01:57.950 --> 03:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
up with a way to negate some of the
 
03:01:59.690 --> 03:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
arguments so I think they felt that if
 
03:02:03.650 --> 03:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
we have zones where diving is allowed in
 
03:02:04.910 --> 03:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
my opinion that would mean that
 
03:02:07.429 --> 03:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
fishermen are not allowed again we have
 
03:02:10.309 --> 03:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
a very small Coastline and a very and a
 
03:02:13.130 --> 03:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
very important industry I think and
 
03:02:15.230 --> 03:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
these poor guys are up against it at
 
03:02:17.809 --> 03:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
every turn for multiple reasons and and
 
03:02:20.990 --> 03:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
to restrict them further to me is not in
 
03:02:22.190 --> 03:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
our best interest
 
03:02:22.200 --> 03:02:23.990 align:start position:0%
our best interest
follow

03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
follow
 
03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:25.429 align:start position:0%
follow
up

03:02:25.429 --> 03:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:02:27.170 --> 03:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
so without a definition of protected
 
03:02:29.450 --> 03:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
zone is pretty hard to determine and
 
03:02:32.090 --> 03:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
enforce yes it would be pretty I mean
 
03:02:35.150 --> 03:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
we'd have to have we'd have to rehash a
 
03:02:37.790 --> 03:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
definition of that for sure yes if I was
 
03:02:39.050 --> 03:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
ever going to make a case on it because
 
03:02:40.309 --> 03:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
the first thing a judge would ask me is
 
03:02:41.990 --> 03:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
what is that I'd have to describe that
 
03:02:45.050 --> 03:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
in detail and we'd have to Market we'd
 
03:02:46.550 --> 03:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
have to maintain those boundaries so
 
03:02:48.170 --> 03:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
that everybody knew that and that we
 
03:02:49.550 --> 03:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
could present that in court if we ever
 
03:02:51.530 --> 03:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
looked to convict anyone for violating
 
03:02:51.540 --> 03:02:52.370 align:start position:0%
looked to convict anyone for violating
it

03:02:52.370 --> 03:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:02:54.969 --> 03:02:54.979 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up if I made follow-up
 
03:02:57.889 --> 03:02:57.899 align:start position:0%
and on page two
 
03:03:00.230 --> 03:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
line one
 
03:03:02.030 --> 03:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
shall be within 100 yards of the
 
03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
shoreline is that at the high water mark
 
03:03:06.170 --> 03:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
low water mark or what is the definition
 
03:03:08.570 --> 03:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
there yeah so that that could that could
 
03:03:10.790 --> 03:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
vary the way it's written now that would
 
03:03:12.769 --> 03:03:12.779 align:start position:0%
vary you'd have to have that spelled out
 
03:03:15.769 --> 03:03:15.779 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you
 
03:03:17.990 --> 03:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:03:21.170 --> 03:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Colonel Jordan I always
 
03:03:24.950 --> 03:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate yourself please don't take an
 
03:03:26.269 --> 03:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
insult to that I know you wrote the
 
03:03:28.190 --> 03:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
Amendments but I think it's important to
 
03:03:29.870 --> 03:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
note that that's why they get written
 
03:03:31.610 --> 03:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
nothing I've nothing I've written has
 
03:03:33.469 --> 03:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
been touched on you all right all right
 
03:03:33.479 --> 03:03:35.210 align:start position:0%
been touched on you all right all right
so

03:03:35.210 --> 03:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I actually have a question for for
 
03:03:39.830 --> 03:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
each of you if if that's all right my
 
03:03:41.750 --> 03:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
first question is the enforcement piece
 
03:03:44.450 --> 03:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh Colonel Jordan I understand that it's
 
03:03:45.830 --> 03:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
the method to take would not be
 
03:03:45.840 --> 03:03:47.150 align:start position:0%
the method to take would not be
enforceable

03:03:47.150 --> 03:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
03:03:50.330 --> 03:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
but the idea that there would be an
 
03:03:52.010 --> 03:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
increase whereas there's there's no
 
03:03:54.170 --> 03:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
enforceability currently for divers to
 
03:03:58.130 --> 03:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
not you know coach traps or however else
 
03:03:59.809 --> 03:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
whatever other issues might you might
 
03:04:03.170 --> 03:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
suspect so where is the presumption or
 
03:04:05.150 --> 03:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
why is there a presumption that that
 
03:04:07.190 --> 03:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
activity would increase when we
 
03:04:10.429 --> 03:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
currently have no way to enforce it I
 
03:04:12.710 --> 03:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
think so I'll try to answer that as best
 
03:04:14.630 --> 03:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
as I can I think some of that could be
 
03:04:16.450 --> 03:04:16.460 align:start position:0%
answered by I don't know
 
03:04:19.010 --> 03:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
there's a there's certainly the word is
 
03:04:22.130 --> 03:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
out that they can't uh dive on lobster
 
03:04:25.130 --> 03:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
traps so my experience has been divers
 
03:04:27.349 --> 03:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
May dive in the area but they don't dive
 
03:04:28.910 --> 03:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
over the traps because it's well known
 
03:04:30.950 --> 03:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
that that's not allowed now I would
 
03:04:32.870 --> 03:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
worry that that would go away if we were
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
to allow diving if we were allow diving
 
03:04:38.090 --> 03:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
where there is lobster fishing I guess I
 
03:04:40.010 --> 03:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
should say that would probably increase
 
03:04:42.170 --> 03:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
and that would be a concern oh and the
 
03:04:44.269 --> 03:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
other thing I wanted to add there was a
 
03:04:46.730 --> 03:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
diving fatality I I specifically
 
03:04:50.150 --> 03:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
remember it was in 2013 a diver went
 
03:04:52.610 --> 03:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
down to recover his lost traps and
 
03:04:55.070 --> 03:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
drowned passed away so there have been
 
03:04:56.990 --> 03:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
diving accidents not many but there have
 
03:04:58.370 --> 03:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
been some
 
03:05:00.769 --> 03:05:00.779 align:start position:0%
you know follow up on it quick follow up
 
03:05:04.370 --> 03:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh so that was his own lost job as a
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay yeah he was trying to recover his
 
03:05:07.849 --> 03:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
own law strap and the other question is
 
03:05:10.910 --> 03:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
very brief for uh Ms Patterson
 
03:05:12.650 --> 03:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
um I believe we had had a conversation I
 
03:05:15.650 --> 03:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify the number 250
 
03:05:18.590 --> 03:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
000 traps are lost per year in these
 
03:05:20.570 --> 03:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
Waters is that what I remember from our
 
03:05:24.469 --> 03:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
conversation no our conversation uh had
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
to do with whether I had any clear
 
03:05:31.309 --> 03:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
numbers as to uh what ghost gear is out
 
03:05:34.910 --> 03:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
there and there is a there was a study
 
03:05:37.730 --> 03:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
done in the state of Maine where they
 
03:05:40.490 --> 03:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
had 250 000 traps that they had
 
03:05:44.570 --> 03:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
estimated to be lost of course the state
 
03:05:48.590 --> 03:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
of Maine has a lot more traps than a 14
 
03:05:52.429 --> 03:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:55.610 --> 03:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
okay representative Brown
 
03:05:56.990 --> 03:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
dummy Smith
 
03:05:58.790 --> 03:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Colonel
 
03:06:00.650 --> 03:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
yes sir just to follow up from on the
 
03:06:02.870 --> 03:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement side so I'm reading the
 
03:06:04.790 --> 03:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
letter here and I do understand the best
 
03:06:06.650 --> 03:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
case scenario for enforcement would be
 
03:06:08.570 --> 03:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
to catch the guy grabbing a lobster
 
03:06:11.570 --> 03:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
right that would also apply to deer
 
03:06:13.250 --> 03:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
hunting or turkey best case scenario
 
03:06:17.090 --> 03:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
absolutely but majority of time the fish
 
03:06:19.250 --> 03:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
and game officer is not on site and it's
 
03:06:21.349 --> 03:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
the actual completion of the
 
03:06:23.090 --> 03:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
investigation or the enforcement part is
 
03:06:25.670 --> 03:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
done through an investigative process to
 
03:06:28.309 --> 03:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
get to that conviction of the guy
 
03:06:30.590 --> 03:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
poaching yes and that would include uh
 
03:06:31.969 --> 03:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
just remember that would include witness
 
03:06:33.769 --> 03:06:33.779 align:start position:0%
testimony so someone else may have seen
 
03:06:35.690 --> 03:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
it or evidence collected at the scene
 
03:06:37.969 --> 03:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
which brings up another point that would
 
03:06:41.510 --> 03:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
be non-existent underwater so in a in a
 
03:06:43.429 --> 03:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
deer hunting case an illegal case we
 
03:06:45.530 --> 03:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
follow blood Trails we follow tracks we
 
03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
follow we pick up casings those are all
 
03:06:49.370 --> 03:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
pieces of evidence to make that case
 
03:06:51.650 --> 03:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
otherwise you won't make it in an
 
03:06:53.389 --> 03:06:53.399 align:start position:0%
underwater situation you're not going to
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
get any of that you're not going to have
 
03:06:56.030 --> 03:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
any of that and you're not going to have
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
any witness testimony or very limited
 
03:06:59.269 --> 03:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
what I'm I'll tell you what I'm going to
 
03:07:01.010 --> 03:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
get I'm going to get from and I don't
 
03:07:02.269 --> 03:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
mind them hearing it I'm going to get
 
03:07:04.370 --> 03:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
from these guys behind me they went into
 
03:07:06.290 --> 03:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
my trap they won't know that they're
 
03:07:07.610 --> 03:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
going to assume that and they're going
 
03:07:09.530 --> 03:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
to put pressure on us to stop that and
 
03:07:11.630 --> 03:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be powerless to do that I
 
03:07:13.070 --> 03:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
don't know how I'd do that
 
03:07:15.230 --> 03:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh other than guesswork and you can't
 
03:07:16.370 --> 03:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
bring as you know you can't bring
 
03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
guesswork into court it won't fly so
 
03:07:20.269 --> 03:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
that's my concern that's one of my big
 
03:07:20.279 --> 03:07:21.410 align:start position:0%
that's my concern that's one of my big
concerns

03:07:21.410 --> 03:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
03:07:23.269 --> 03:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
one follow-up for
 
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
and I'll be done very quick how many
 
03:07:28.550 --> 03:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
lobsters on day are caught on average I
 
03:07:29.809 --> 03:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
don't know it's not a question for the
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
colonel it's probably in the commercial
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
industry how many Lobster in a day I
 
03:07:36.830 --> 03:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't I mean is it a thousand ten
 
03:07:40.849 --> 03:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
thousand uh I'm in state waters yes I
 
03:07:43.490 --> 03:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
would it would be in the thousands so
 
03:07:45.769 --> 03:07:45.779 align:start position:0%
theoretically if this bill became law
 
03:07:48.530 --> 03:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
this would allow a minimum of 300 if
 
03:07:51.110 --> 03:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's 100 licenses and three with a
 
03:07:53.630 --> 03:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
minimum so the numbers detrimental is
 
03:07:56.690 --> 03:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
all I'm trying to show just bear in mind
 
03:07:59.150 --> 03:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
that collecting them by hand could do a
 
03:08:00.830 --> 03:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
lot more damage you may have them in
 
03:08:02.269 --> 03:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
hand but that doesn't mean that that's
 
03:08:04.190 --> 03:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
the only impact on the resource okay
 
03:08:06.469 --> 03:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
just bear that in mind thank you thank
 
03:08:08.090 --> 03:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony I'm going to cut
 
03:08:09.590 --> 03:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
off the questions for this because we
 
03:08:10.910 --> 03:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
have one more speaker and we've got a
 
03:08:13.010 --> 03:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
hard stop at 115 when this room is going
 
03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:20.269 --> 03:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to call Mike Flanagan
 
03:08:23.210 --> 03:08:23.220 align:start position:0%
you asked for five minutes and if you
 
03:08:24.530 --> 03:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
could please keep it under that I'd
 
03:08:28.130 --> 03:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:28.140 --> 03:08:35.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:08:35.469 --> 03:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:37.929 --> 03:08:37.939 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and committee
 
03:08:41.210 --> 03:08:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh Mike Flanagan Ryan New Hampshire I'm
 
03:08:43.010 --> 03:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of myself well myself
 
03:08:44.990 --> 03:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
and my family
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
I used to be the young kid I'm the old
 
03:08:49.370 --> 03:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
guy now I've been doing this for 67
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
years as my brother has been we both
 
03:08:55.610 --> 03:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
have 1200 trap licenses my son's own a
 
03:08:58.370 --> 03:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
wholesale off-site piece of waterfront
 
03:09:00.110 --> 03:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
property in Kittery they do business
 
03:09:02.450 --> 03:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
both Maine and New Hampshire fishermen
 
03:09:04.670 --> 03:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
my whole family is deeply involved in
 
03:09:06.230 --> 03:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
the lobster Fishery
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to the bill for obvious
 
03:09:11.450 --> 03:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
reasons about the skin diving thing I
 
03:09:12.650 --> 03:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand the man that
 
03:09:14.750 --> 03:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
proposed the bill what this thing is
 
03:09:17.210 --> 03:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
about cutting funding from the wardens
 
03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
in federal waters that's ridiculous I
 
03:09:21.410 --> 03:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand his reason for it
 
03:09:23.210 --> 03:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
can somebody explain to me why that was
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
03:09:26.809 --> 03:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that's no longer a
 
03:09:28.250 --> 03:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
concern and it's being brought out of
 
03:09:30.769 --> 03:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
the bill according to the prime sponsor
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a requirement because uh
 
03:09:36.590 --> 03:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
the delay in activating the federal
 
03:09:38.510 --> 03:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
regulations that was put in for six
 
03:09:41.570 --> 03:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
years has made it in ineffective
 
03:09:44.990 --> 03:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
well my situation is anybody that knows
 
03:09:46.490 --> 03:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
the situation would never bring that up
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
because the three mile limit between
 
03:09:51.170 --> 03:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
state waters and area One Federal line
 
03:09:52.969 --> 03:09:52.979 align:start position:0%
it's all over the place in New Hampshire
 
03:09:56.269 --> 03:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
and most of us have Federal permits
 
03:09:58.130 --> 03:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
it's utterly ridiculous we could be
 
03:10:00.650 --> 03:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
fishing in state waters
 
03:10:02.269 --> 03:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
and have something on the boat we didn't
 
03:10:03.769 --> 03:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
want the wardens to cease we'd just jump
 
03:10:05.809 --> 03:10:05.819 align:start position:0%
over the line say you can't touch me I'm
 
03:10:08.210 --> 03:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
in federal waters now it's that should
 
03:10:10.250 --> 03:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
never happen we need more enforcement
 
03:10:11.690 --> 03:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
not less
 
03:10:14.630 --> 03:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of things people brought up
 
03:10:16.490 --> 03:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
I want a kind of a show and tell
 
03:10:18.290 --> 03:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
situation I want to show you some of the
 
03:10:21.050 --> 03:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
tools we use I don't want to be here all
 
03:10:23.570 --> 03:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
day long people talked about ghost traps
 
03:10:27.230 --> 03:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
this is a biodegradable Escape then
 
03:10:30.050 --> 03:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
this is from the Federal Register we use
 
03:10:32.030 --> 03:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
stainless steel rings on this end as a
 
03:10:34.550 --> 03:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
hinge a steel ring on this end to
 
03:10:34.560 --> 03:10:36.349 align:start position:0%
hinge a steel ring on this end to
disintegrate

03:10:36.349 --> 03:10:36.359 align:start position:0%
disintegrate
 
03:10:36.359 --> 03:10:38.630 align:start position:0%
disintegrate
opens

03:10:38.630 --> 03:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
opens
 
03:10:40.309 --> 03:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to be three and three quarter
 
03:10:41.870 --> 03:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
inches this is four and a quarter inches
 
03:10:44.450 --> 03:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
a huge Lobster will get out of there and
 
03:10:46.190 --> 03:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
as Bill macaroni said these things do
 
03:10:47.809 --> 03:10:47.819 align:start position:0%
work we have to maintain them all the
 
03:10:51.070 --> 03:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
time and replace the steel rings
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is called a crab vent or a circular
 
03:10:57.290 --> 03:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
vent two and seven sixteenths inches a
 
03:10:58.849 --> 03:10:58.859 align:start position:0%
lot of lobsters come and go through that
 
03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
another point I want to make I have a I
 
03:11:02.809 --> 03:11:02.819 align:start position:0%
have a bird feeder outside my house most
 
03:11:04.969 --> 03:11:04.979 align:start position:0%
of you people probably do and the
 
03:11:07.010 --> 03:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
reality of it is our lobster traps our
 
03:11:09.410 --> 03:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
Lobster feeders
 
03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
we're required to have this vent where
 
03:11:13.849 --> 03:11:13.859 align:start position:0%
we kind of this vent most of us have
 
03:11:16.490 --> 03:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
several of these vents
 
03:11:19.730 --> 03:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
this is a v-notch tool that we've Notch
 
03:11:21.950 --> 03:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
the Tails of the female lobsters with
 
03:11:23.870 --> 03:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
this is the measure we use to measure
 
03:11:26.330 --> 03:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:29.150 --> 03:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
I was I've been here a long time
 
03:11:31.429 --> 03:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
we fought this v-nots issue years ago
 
03:11:32.929 --> 03:11:32.939 align:start position:0%
Maine came up with it we all thought it
 
03:11:35.690 --> 03:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
was ridiculous now we all Notch and
 
03:11:38.030 --> 03:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous tremendous volume
 
03:11:40.130 --> 03:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
of V notch lopsis in the resource the
 
03:11:42.170 --> 03:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
lobster resource because of this is
 
03:11:44.809 --> 03:11:44.819 align:start position:0%
extremely healthy but my point is
 
03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
feeding the lobsters
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
there are photographs people had it
 
03:11:51.469 --> 03:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
amazed me when I saw it how many lobs
 
03:11:53.510 --> 03:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
have swarmed to the traps of all sizes
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
they swim in they swim out it's they're
 
03:11:58.190 --> 03:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
just like the bird feeders at our house
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
I'd like to pass this around a few folks
 
03:12:01.670 --> 03:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
who like to look at it any questions
 
03:12:04.670 --> 03:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
about it or any other questions
 
03:12:07.309 --> 03:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I'll allow
 
03:12:10.130 --> 03:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
the Reps to look at that on our way out
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
um does anybody have any questions real
 
03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:15.710 align:start position:0%
um does anybody have any questions real
quick

03:12:15.710 --> 03:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
Adam clerk thank you did I thank you for
 
03:12:20.030 --> 03:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question did I hear you
 
03:12:22.130 --> 03:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
correctly just very brief yes or no that
 
03:12:25.610 --> 03:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
the industry actually was very resistant
 
03:12:28.130 --> 03:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
to previous regulations like the
 
03:12:30.290 --> 03:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
requirement to v-notch for example but
 
03:12:32.090 --> 03:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
then that regulation turned out to be an
 
03:12:34.010 --> 03:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
actual good thing
 
03:12:36.170 --> 03:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
I can say this now because I'm the
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
oldest one
 
03:12:40.210 --> 03:12:40.220 align:start position:0%
we as Lobster fishermen are extremely
 
03:12:43.969 --> 03:12:43.979 align:start position:0%
extremely resistant to change anything
 
03:12:43.979 --> 03:12:45.290 align:start position:0%
extremely resistant to change anything
we

03:12:45.290 --> 03:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:12:47.450 --> 03:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
there was tremendous opposition what
 
03:12:48.650 --> 03:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
we've tried to do over the years
 
03:12:51.469 --> 03:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
Connection in different states is to
 
03:12:54.170 --> 03:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
have the same minimum size New Hampshire
 
03:12:55.610 --> 03:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
was always smaller and there's a
 
03:12:56.809 --> 03:12:56.819 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of Bloodshed and
 
03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
raising the lobster measure a tremendous
 
03:13:00.769 --> 03:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
amount of Bloodshed adopting anything
 
03:13:02.510 --> 03:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
from anybody else no matter what it is
 
03:13:04.309 --> 03:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
we just like to be resistant that's
 
03:13:06.050 --> 03:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the nature of the lobster
 
03:13:08.690 --> 03:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
fisherman but it's worked out well
 
03:13:10.969 --> 03:13:10.979 align:start position:0%
Maine New Hampshire Massachusetts all
 
03:13:12.590 --> 03:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
had the same maximum size the same
 
03:13:14.570 --> 03:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
minimum size the dealers could swap
 
03:13:16.250 --> 03:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
lobsters back and forth among the states
 
03:13:18.469 --> 03:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's working very well
 
03:13:19.610 --> 03:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:13:22.130 --> 03:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
any other real quick questions
 
03:13:24.650 --> 03:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you for your
 
03:13:27.769 --> 03:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you and that concludes
 
03:13:34.370 --> 03:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'll leave these on the corner of the
 
03:13:37.309 --> 03:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
table and I'll wait a few minutes if you
 
03:13:38.690 --> 03:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
folks want to stop and talk to somebody
 
03:13:41.690 --> 03:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
but I want to apologize to the director
 
03:13:43.370 --> 03:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
fishing game that we don't have enough
 
03:13:46.070 --> 03:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
time to finish the discussion today but
 
03:13:48.349 --> 03:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
we will pick up if you want to invite
 
03:13:50.389 --> 03:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
