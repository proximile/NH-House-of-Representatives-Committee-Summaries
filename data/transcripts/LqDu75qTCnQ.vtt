Connecticut

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
why can't we get a full committee good
 
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
morning welcome to the house special
 
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
committee on housing it is 1004 so we're
 
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to get started let's get started
 
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
justice for all
 
00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.210 align:start position:0%
justice for all
okay

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
so the primary purpose of today is to
 
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
um dot our eyes and cross our T's and
 
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
get some of the rest of this language
 
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
down so
 
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
um the first thing
 
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
I'm going I'm hoping it's it's very hot
 
00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 align:start position:0%
in here already there's no AC so I'm
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
hoping this is kind of a quick day
 
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm probably gonna take my coat off
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm the first thing I'm going to do is
 
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
call on representative Damon who
 
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
indicated she would like to
 
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.670 align:start position:0%
indicated she would like to
um

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
bring something up
 
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
um and I will informally say I really
 
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
wish you guys would all take your coats
 
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.950 align:start position:0%
wish you guys would all take your coats
off

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
um so the reason I asked for a few
 
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
minutes is I want some feedback on
 
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
the idea of proposing legislation to
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
um make sprinklers optional in
 
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
residential existing residential
 
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
buildings that are being converted to
 
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
three units
 
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
from single-family homes
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
with no increase in the number of
 
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
bedrooms so there's not a greater
 
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
there doesn't appear to be a greater
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
liability a greater risk
 
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
there was some mention of the issue of
 
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.610 align:start position:0%
there was some mention of the issue of
sprinklers

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 align:start position:0%
sprinklers
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
in I think two or three different
 
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
speakers this spring I have not frankly
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
done the work to look back and see who
 
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
said that
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
and more recently the director of
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
planning and economic development in
 
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
Claremont Nancy Merrill who's been in
 
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
that position a long time very
 
00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 align:start position:0%
experienced knowledgeable person
 
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
brought that up as a recurring issue
 
00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
I think claremont's not unique in having
 
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 align:start position:0%
many of these old homes in various
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
levels of good or or inadequate
 
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
condition and there's a fair amount of
 
00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 align:start position:0%
interest in making them into Workforce
 
00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.390 align:start position:0%
interest in making them into Workforce
housing

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
and the cost of sprinklers is
 
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
prohibitive on top of the additional you
 
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
know costs of all the work that is
 
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.830 align:start position:0%
know costs of all the work that is
required

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
so I had not prioritized this until
 
00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
Nancy brought it back up last week
 
00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:25.189 align:start position:0%
Nancy brought it back up last week
um

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
and I'm just looking for feedback from
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
people on
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
um what you think how to proceed clearly
 
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
need to navigate through the fire
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
marshal and see if we can come to an
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
agreement where they don't oppose it
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
so that's my question thank you
 
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo they can switch
 
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.850 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo they can switch
here

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
um Governor Damon
 
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative Damon are you are you do
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
you have any idea of how much a
 
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
sprinkler building would cost of those
 
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.930 align:start position:0%
sprinkler building would cost of those
sizes

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
sizes
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
so I think that there's a lot of
 
00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:01.430 align:start position:0%
so I think that there's a lot of
variation

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
variation
 
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.809 align:start position:0%
variation
um

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
the preliminary conversation I had with
 
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
one Builder it was very anecdotal
 
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
noted that the the lines the pipes would
 
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
most likely be exposed because otherwise
 
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
it would really be cost prohibitive
 
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
um and he said 60 to 100 000 but I think
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
that was like a pretty much off the top
 
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
of the head so I need more info
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Rudy thank
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I think it depends on
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
the size of the house number one
 
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
um how many floors you have I mean if
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
you have to go up another floor there
 
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
could even be more
 
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.490 align:start position:0%
could even be more
um

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
the cost is really
 
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
putting a lot of people out of the
 
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
market exactly for sprinklers okay in a
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
case like myself I don't know how much
 
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
they're needed
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
I cook a lot
 
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
and I bet you four or five times a year
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
my alarm goes off
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
and I just wouldn't want a sprinkler
 
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
going off at the same time
 
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm not a big fan of sprinklers
 
00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:10.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
so you cook but you don't cook well is
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
I overcooked sometimes got it and you
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
know I read someplace if you undercooked
 
00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:21.539 align:start position:0%
that means you're not cooking with
 
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:23.220 align:start position:0%
passion if you overcook you're cooking
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
with love so I'm always burning stuff I
 
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
um so oh representative thank you Mr
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
chair my understanding is that sprinkles
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
are activated by heat and not smoke so
 
00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
you would have to be really burning
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
something to have a splinter go off
 
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
um so not knowing anything really about
 
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:50.060 align:start position:0%
this and certainly 60 000 sounds
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
a like it just can't be that much but B
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be super prohibitive
 
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.710 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be super prohibitive
right

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
um so I am uh I don't know if this makes
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
me a less passionate cook but I I
 
00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
support sprinklers in general but I if
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
you're not as you said increasing the
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
number of bedrooms and the cost truly is
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
that's you know astronomical then that
 
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
would be something and again this is
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
first blush and I'd like more
 
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
information but I on my knee-jerk
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
reaction is to be supportive
 
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna call on Ben Frost to come
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
in and give us a little bit of context
 
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
in this Ben could you talk to us about
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
um if this is an existing code and would
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
this require an RSA or would this uh
 
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
require just an update to code or some
 
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
more flexibility thank you Ben thank you
 
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman Ben Frost from New Hampshire
 
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
Housing and I want to thank
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
representative Damon for bringing this
 
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
up uh there
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
as as you probably know uh state law uh
 
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
relative to the the building and fire
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
codes does not allow
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
for the requirement for sprinklers in
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
one and two family structures
 
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you right now there there
 
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
are discussions ongoing with the
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
building officials and with the State
 
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal's Office about extending
 
00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:16.019 align:start position:0%
that to three and four family structures
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
so four units
 
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.769 align:start position:0%
so four units
um

00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
provided certain
 
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
conditions are met such as you know
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
independent means of egress for each
 
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
unit so external egress which would
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
require in some cases the construction
 
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.269 align:start position:0%
require in some cases the construction
of

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:36.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
those things when I'm drawing a blank on
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
a stairs exterior external staircases
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
that are fire rated
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
um so I that that is something that is
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
going on right now I I don't
 
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
I think it probably would require uh a
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
statutory change uh relative to the
 
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
building code and possibly also to the
 
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
fire code I'm not sure I'm less familiar
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
with how the fire code is amended than
 
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
than the building code
 
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
so through so what you're saying is
 
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
through the legislature or the code the
 
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:09.949 align:start position:0%
through the legislature or the code the
code

00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
could update to that
 
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
um because we could have representative
 
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:16.019 align:start position:0%
Damon file an LSR as a placeholder and
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
continued discussions with um the Fire
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
Marshal's office and and boa I think
 
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense Mr chairman
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
okay to extend it to four units up from
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
two okay yes both for the building code
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
and the fire code and I encourage
 
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
representative Damon to check with the
 
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal's office and also with uh
 
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
Bill McKinney from the state New
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire building officials Association
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
he was here at the last meeting and I
 
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
have Bill's contact information
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
um and the Fire Marshal's office has
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
sent me an email as well so I'll send
 
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
over that contact as well
 
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
yes of course representative Damon so I
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for your input and help
 
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.110 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for your input and help
um

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
so the building code part of it separate
 
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
from fire code
 
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
is in RSA it's a would-need a
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
legislative address
 
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.030 align:start position:0%
legislative address
there

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
the the building code is
 
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
um a statute that is primarily by
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
reference by reference to the
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
international residential code the
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
international building code the IRC and
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
the IBC
 
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
and uh the there are amendments to that
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
that are expansions or exceptions from
 
00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:35.339 align:start position:0%
the IRC and the IBC
 
00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:36.350 align:start position:0%
the IRC and the IBC
um

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
and those do require legislative action
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
generally speaking that is done through
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code review board
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
which makes recommendations for
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
amendments to those codes and those are
 
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
often done in a kind of a package bill
 
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
that embodies all of the Amendments that
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
so is there currently a bill going
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
forward a package of amendments to the
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
building code
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
um I can't say because we don't have the
 
00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:14.339 align:start position:0%
the LSR filing period hasn't begun yet
 
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
um and it often goes in as a Senate bill
 
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
because of the later filing period
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
and given given the task of this
 
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
committee there's there should be
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
nothing stopping us if we see something
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
that we would like to submit separately
 
00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:29.579 align:start position:0%
I think we're completely within our
 
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to do that so I recommend
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
that you reach out to those peop those
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
groups and let them know
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
at least let them know or have them
 
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
coordinate with you if possible
 
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
representative Ocala thank you
 
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.110 align:start position:0%
representative Ocala thank you
um

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at uh it looks like RSA
 
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.150 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at uh it looks like RSA
um

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
153 colon 5. it says it was amended in
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
2010 to prohibit the State Fire Marshal
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
from adopting rules that quote require
 
00:14:02.569 --> 00:14:02.579 align:start position:0%
automatic suppressant or sprinkler
 
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
systems in detached one or two family
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
resonance so that
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
all right right and so this is one of
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
the things that you might want to you
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
know discuss
 
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:20.540 align:start position:0%
um one 153 colon 5. and so
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
theoretically without even addressing
 
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.230 align:start position:0%
theoretically without even addressing
that

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
um the actual code you could just amend
 
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
that RSA I said I assume to just extend
 
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
it and I and just FYI I would also be in
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
favor of four that was up to four that's
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking so I think we're all
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
on the same page if I made Mr chairman
 
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh the other statute is 155 a that's the
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
State Building Code and I believe
 
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
there's a a an analogous provision in
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you again Mr Frost as
 
00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:55.730 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you again Mr Frost as
always

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
um so the four unit thing that would be
 
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
fairly uniform with a number of other I
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
think federal regulations and guidelines
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
am I correct that there's there's like a
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
and state for that matter I think that's
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
where we do the um what's the word
 
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
excluded or restricted restricted thank
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
you and unrestricted so
 
00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
um so that would put us that particular
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
segment of the building code in line
 
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
with all these other kind this this
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
delineating line between four units and
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
more is like your true multi-family
 
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.189 align:start position:0%
more is like your true multi-family
I

00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative Reed I think that's
 
00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
generally true although different
 
00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:35.180 align:start position:0%
statutes have different standards but
 
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
for example for
 
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.170 align:start position:0%
for example for
um

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
for a site plan review the a planning
 
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:44.180 align:start position:0%
board's jurisdiction is three or more
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
for Workforce housing the requirement is
 
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:51.260 align:start position:0%
five or more infrastructure but for uh
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
lending purposes for federal backing FHA
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
you can get a conventional single-family
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
mortgage for an owner occupied
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
four unit structure
 
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
thank you that's actually really good
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
information for me personally as well
 
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
and if I may just add a comment for uh
 
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
representative Damon uh I've had success
 
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
in the past with putting in lsrs as a
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
and motivator for the administration
 
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
um and I'm thinking because there's two
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
different moving pieces to what you're
 
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
talking about there's the delineation
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
between two units to four units but also
 
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:37.100 align:start position:0%
if you are converting a single family
 
00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
home so like on the conservative end you
 
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:41.579 align:start position:0%
could say if you're converting a single
 
00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:44.579 align:start position:0%
pre-existing single-family home and it's
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
not going to be more than four units
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
then there's no requirement for
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
sprinklers the more aggressive approach
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
would be either converting a single
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
family home regardless of the number of
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
units and anything with less than with
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
four units or less so there's two like
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
there's a more conservative approach and
 
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
more aggressive approach
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
anyway just just thoughts
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
and go ahead represent Damon
 
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
I just have one more question for Mr
 
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.449 align:start position:0%
I just have one more question for Mr
Frost

00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
Frost
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
is there any procedure for a homeowner
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
who is trying to do this kind of project
 
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.730 align:start position:0%
who is trying to do this kind of project
currently

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
to get a waiver of the sprinkler
 
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.390 align:start position:0%
to get a waiver of the sprinkler
requirement

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
yes I believe there is I believe the
 
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshal has the authority to
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
Grant such waivers uh waivers or
 
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
variances I'm not sure what the right
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
terminology is for the the fire code
 
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
for the the building code
 
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.250 align:start position:0%
for the the building code
um

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:49.940 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think through this because
 
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
municipalities can't adopt something
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.370 align:start position:0%
that is
um

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
less restrictive than the State Building
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
Code in their local building code
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
amendments and I think that that would
 
00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:04.820 align:start position:0%
be construed as being less restrictive
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
you could pursue
 
00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:09.110 align:start position:0%
you could pursue
um

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
a a variance I suppose and again I'm a
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
lot less familiar with the building
 
00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:18.419 align:start position:0%
codes than I am with say Planning and
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
Zoning but there I imagine there is a
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
variance process that involves the local
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
building code board of appeals which is
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
typically the zba but sometimes is a
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
separate board Appeals
 
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
of decisions of which would go to the
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
State Building Code review board appeals
 
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
would then go to the Superior Court then
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court so it's a long
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
potentially a long process to get relief
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
so let me ask you if um this was
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
extended to four units in the state
 
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
would not require more
 
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
sprinklers for up to four units is
 
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
there's no language stopping a
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
municipality from requiring for does
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
that happen often
 
00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:05.299 align:start position:0%
where where the the municipalities
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
requirements are more stringent than the
 
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.230 align:start position:0%
requirements are more stringent than the
states

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
well right now Mr chairman uh sprinklers
 
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
would be required for three and four
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
unit structures
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
right so if this bill goes through I
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
guess my question is would miss valleys
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
be like well we don't really like that
 
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
so we'll
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
we will require three and four for this
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
town or this city no I don't think so we
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
would typically follow the guidance the
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
way the statutes are written
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and there may be a
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
separate statute that addresses this
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
I've it's been what 13 years now since
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
we dealt with this
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh there may be a different statute that
 
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
addresses Municipal capacity and that
 
00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:51.419 align:start position:0%
may be in RSA 674 which is where I think
 
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
it's uh section 51 right thereabouts
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
where municipalities can adopt
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
amendments local amendments to the State
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
Building Code
 
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
but I would check with Mr McKinney and
 
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
the State Fire Marshal on these
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
questions okay and my other question
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
would be for buildings that have three
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
or four units If This Were to pass
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
they would not be required to upkeep
 
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
those systems moving forward or would
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
they be required to continue upkeep of
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
them because that might also be
 
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
something that should be added
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
um so that there's no rule making
 
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
against that it's probably beyond my
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
portfolio and I check with the building
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
officials and the fire marshal and
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative and that's probably a
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
good question to ask too good okay
 
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else for Mr Frost
 
00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
okay representative Damon do you have
 
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
anything else I think this is a good
 
00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
discussion to have not at this time and
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate the opportunity to
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
process and I will do my homework and
 
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
more than likely file an LSR and then
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to discuss it awesome
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
even if it's just a placeholder and
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
until you get language we're happy to
 
00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
you know entertain it at a later date
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you all very much all right okay
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
um represent McConkey do you have an
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
update for us good morning
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I've had
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
conversations with uh Phil throwbridge
 
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:21.020 align:start position:0%
manager land resource management program
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
on where to fit my proposed change for
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
stone and pipe and we keep going back
 
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
and forth which RSA if we need to add
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
something new I'm hoping to wrap that up
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
today okay if not I'm gonna let Ls I'm
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
on asked to draft it and then come back
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
to them and say you know do they agree
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
or disagree but all conversations all
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
conversations since we left here have
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
been positive with them
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
well I'm happy to even look at the
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
language if you send it to the committee
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
happy to just look at it and not reply
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
all and we'd have a discussion okay as a
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
committee at some time sure I'll do that
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you that sounds good
 
00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:03.299 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else
 
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
so I have a um LSR or a draft LSR the
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
committee should have it there's copies
 
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:12.059 align:start position:0%
on the table this kind of go along goes
 
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
along with the uh what we were talking
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
about last week regarding conditional
 
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.070 align:start position:0%
about last week regarding conditional
permitting

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
the language is within um RSA two
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
sixty three that governs dot driveway
 
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
permits so initially like representative
 
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
Reed alluded to I wanted to do
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
restricted versus unrestricted for
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
driveway permits but
 
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
um the idea
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
instead was to use the language that dot
 
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059 align:start position:0%
already uses for different unit sizes so
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
um the primary change
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
is in section two
 
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
I'm going to read this
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
before any construction or alteration
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
work is commenced said permit
 
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
application shall have been reviewed in
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
a construction permit issued by said
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
Department within 30 days for budding
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
properties as defined in RSA 236 and
 
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
within 45 days for budding properties as
 
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 236 and then on the
 
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
second page we're adding a new section
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
that would say that would basically be
 
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
the Crux of it that would say if the
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
department fails to act within 30 days
 
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
for budding properties
 
00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299 align:start position:0%
and within 45 days for budding
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
properties the applicant may ask
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
Department to issue permit by submitting
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
a written request and if the applicant
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
has previously agreed to accept
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
Communications but from the Department
 
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
by electronic means a request submitted
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
electronically by the Implement
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
applicant shall constitute a written
 
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.029 align:start position:0%
applicant shall constitute a written
request

00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
So within 14 days of the receipt the
 
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
written requests of the applicant the
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
department shall either approve the
 
00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:45.419 align:start position:0%
application in whole or in part and
 
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
issue the permit or deny the application
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
and this is the important part issue
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
written findings in support of the
 
00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.669 align:start position:0%
written findings in support of the
denial

00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
denial
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
and then if the department does not
 
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
issue a permit or written denial within
 
00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
the 14-day period the applicant shall be
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
deemed to have a permit by default and
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
may proceed with the project as
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
presented of the application
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
the authorization provided by the sub
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
paragraph shall not relieve the
 
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
applicant of complying with all
 
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:10.580 align:start position:0%
requirements applicable to the project
 
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
including not limited to requirements
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
established in or under this chapter and
 
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
any chapter rating relating to
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
so upon receipt of a written request
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
from the applicant the department shall
 
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:27.299 align:start position:0%
issue written confirmation the applicant
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
has a permit by default pursuant to
 
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
subcarov B without which authorizes the
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
applicant to proceed with the project
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
has presented so this would basically
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
I I think this is a rough draft of the
 
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
language I'd like to see I think
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
um representative McConkey kind of
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
indicated that you know when this was
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
implemented in another department it
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
kind of sped the approval of these
 
00:24:48.299 --> 00:24:49.250 align:start position:0%
kind of sped the approval of these
permitting

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
um so I think that this is a completely
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable request
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
um so it'd be 30 days and then a written
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
request of 14 days so that would give
 
00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
them 44 days
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
um to approve these permits so we've
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
seen them go longer but I think that
 
00:25:06.049 --> 00:25:06.059 align:start position:0%
this at least gives
 
00:25:06.059 --> 00:25:07.310 align:start position:0%
this at least gives
um

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:09.299 align:start position:0%
it keeps the state working the direction
 
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
it should improve these approve these
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
permits or deny it in issue findings a
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
fact in support of the denial
 
00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:18.299 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ocala
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
um so uh following your
 
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:33.140 align:start position:0%
um language here it seems like uh C is
 
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.909 align:start position:0%
um language here it seems like uh C is
incorrect

00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
um it would not be upon receipt of the
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
written request because the written
 
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
request is what triggers the 14-day time
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
period so it should actually probably be
 
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
a sub paragraph under B and then it
 
00:25:51.409 --> 00:25:51.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
um expiration of the 14 days or
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
something like that that time period
 
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
where the um because you're saying that
 
00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
the department shall issue written
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
confirmation that the permit has by by
 
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
default pursuant to share sub paragraph
 
00:26:09.649 --> 00:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
B so that only happens after the 14-day
 
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
period right so you would only want to
 
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
issue that
 
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
um that they have a permit by default
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
on that 15th day essentially
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I'm happy for edits to this
 
00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:24.299 align:start position:0%
committee if you think it's stronger I'm
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
I don't mind that at all I think that
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
the like I said the 30 days and the
 
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
additional 14 days is completely enough
 
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.190 align:start position:0%
additional 14 days is completely enough
and

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative Reed we have some go
 
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.190 align:start position:0%
representative Reed we have some go
ahead

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
I was it doesn't say that it was
 
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
defaulted the written request is
 
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.630 align:start position:0%
defaulted the written request is
referencing

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
referencing
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
I'm I either I am confused or
 
00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539 align:start position:0%
representative yokella but I thought his
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
um point was that c was incorrect
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
because there is no written
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
um permit or denial because that's what
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
you're talking about but that's not what
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
C is saying it's it's saying that if
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
nothing was issued in the 14 days the
 
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
applicant can then have a written put in
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
a written request that the permit was
 
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's not what it says it says
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
upon receipt of a written request from
 
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
the applicant the request is on in the
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
request is made in
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh Roman Phi uh Romans 6 where it
 
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.950 align:start position:0%
uh uh Roman Phi uh Romans 6 where it
says

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:33.500 align:start position:0%
um a request submitted
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
electronically by the Apple event shall
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
constitute a written request oh okay so
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
I was uh so you're interpreting that to
 
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
be as the definition of paragraph six
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
and I was interpreting that to be
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
defined as the rest of that sentence
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
um that the written request
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
referred to requesting the in the second
 
00:27:57.649 --> 00:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
line of C confirmation that the
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
applicant had a permit by default
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
so maybe there needs to be a slightly
 
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
clearer language because we're using
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
written requests in two different ways
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
in this uh section
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
I see where the confusion is now thank
 
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
under a
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
is out
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph a I
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's placement is fine it
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
just needs to be clearer that written
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
request here is not the written request
 
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.390 align:start position:0%
request here is not the written request
in

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
um Roman numeral six but is upon receipt
 
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.669 align:start position:0%
um Roman numeral six but is upon receipt
of

00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
um a letter
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
asking the department to confirm you
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
know instead of using that exact term
 
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
that's in in paragraph uh Roman numeral
 
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
six that the department will issue the
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
written confirmation that the applicant
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
was given a permit by default
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
it's it's the problem of using the word
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
written request in two different ways
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
where the applicant is requesting two
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
different things in this chapter
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
by written means and so
 
00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
I don't know if representative yokello
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
heard my aha that makes sense two
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
different written requests is one of
 
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
them I mean yeah
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
defining written requests constitute a
 
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
written request and then if if the
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
chairman is a is meaning that after the
 
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
14 days there's an additional written
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
request then yeah I think it should be
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
more clear that it's a separate request
 
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:39.299 align:start position:0%
um a request for
 
00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:42.419 align:start position:0%
issuance of you know documentation that
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
they have defaulted that's a different
 
00:29:48.889 --> 00:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
because it's just having vague vague
 
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
language of written requests all
 
00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
throughout this from the original
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
written request of the application of
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
the permit exactly two different written
 
00:29:56.279 --> 00:30:00.529 align:start position:0%
the permit exactly two different written
requests

00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm I'm honestly okay with
 
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
and now that I'm reading this I don't
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
really like the
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
in that paragraph B it says which
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
authorizes applicant to proceed with the
 
00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
project has presented in the application
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
they're already authorized right so you
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
would just scratch that wouldn't you I
 
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
mean go ahead and just turn your mic on
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you I think it's just essentially
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that the applicant wants some
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
documentation that they're able to
 
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
proceed so that maybe a building
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
official might be like you know their
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
local building official might be able to
 
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.029 align:start position:0%
local building official might be able to
um

00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
verify that in some way I don't I'm not
 
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.330 align:start position:0%
sure that
um

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
like how would the building official
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
know that the 14 days has expired et
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
cetera et cetera you know what I mean
 
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
and so the problem is I guess if they're
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
taking 14 days to review the application
 
00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:03.419 align:start position:0%
and they expire that then we're
 
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
imagining a situation that the that
 
00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:09.779 align:start position:0%
they're so behind on stuff that they are
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
not able to complete it within the 14
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
days but there's no requirement that
 
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:18.860 align:start position:0%
they issue this written this uh this uh
 
00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.389 align:start position:0%
they issue this written this uh this uh
uh

00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
confirm confirmation that the applicant
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
has a permit by default you don't have a
 
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
time frame for that so they could take
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
you know six months to do that and if
 
00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
the building per the local building
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
permit or the local building official is
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
not allowing them proceed until they can
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
prove that they have the permit then I
 
00:31:42.409 --> 00:31:42.419 align:start position:0%
think you we didn't actually solve
 
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
anything right so okay I'm going to call
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
on um Ben Frost give us some background
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
on this and then we'll continue
 
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:53.450 align:start position:0%
on this and then we'll continue
conversation

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm still Ben
 
00:31:57.289 --> 00:31:57.299 align:start position:0%
Frost still from New Hampshire housing
 
00:31:57.299 --> 00:31:59.570 align:start position:0%
Frost still from New Hampshire housing
if

00:31:59.570 --> 00:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
and I perfectly understand the the
 
00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:03.649 align:start position:0%
and I perfectly understand the the
question

00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:06.299 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking from a
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
customer service standpoint
 
00:32:09.059 --> 00:32:09.769 align:start position:0%
customer service standpoint
um

00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
would it not be better to require the
 
00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
Departments upon essentially defaulting
 
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
to issue a written permit rather than
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
making the applicant pursue the
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
department I'm okay with that too I was
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
reading into this so
 
00:32:27.409 --> 00:32:27.419 align:start position:0%
um we could simplify this language and
 
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
just say after 30 days
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
there's a permit by default
 
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.649 align:start position:0%
there's a permit by default
um

00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
is there any reason that legally that
 
00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
the person building the driveway would
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
need to let dot know they have a permit
 
00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:45.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.889 --> 00:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
no I think the obligation is of the
 
00:32:51.649 --> 00:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
department to issue the permit so that
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
the property owner can
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
show that to the the build local
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
building official to their bank which
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
may require legal access as well and
 
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
anyone else who has an interest in the
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
in the proposal okay so one more
 
00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.149 align:start position:0%
in the proposal okay so one more
question

00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
um if if they're issued a permit by
 
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.510 align:start position:0%
um if if they're issued a permit by
default

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
default
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
dot does not issue the permit
 
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
I'm saying they should that that should
 
00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:19.019 align:start position:0%
be required of the department if they
 
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
are required within they shall so we
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
need to add language that say they shall
 
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
issue within five business days or
 
00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
something like that okay
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna go represent burudi and
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
then representative thank you Mr
 
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
chairman I think if the department does
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
issue it they might want a disclaimer on
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
there saying that they haven't fully
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
reviewed it uh and it was issued by
 
00:33:39.659 --> 00:33:40.610 align:start position:0%
reviewed it uh and it was issued by
default

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
default
 
00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
I think the Department's going to want
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.789 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
um representative Rudy basically made my
 
00:33:57.169 --> 00:33:57.179 align:start position:0%
point that they can issue a permit based
 
00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
on their findings or issue a permit
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
based on this is default we were not
 
00:34:03.169 --> 00:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
able in the 14 days to come up with the
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
reason why this shouldn't be given so we
 
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
have to give it it's by default but it's
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
still a permit
 
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
so that would protect the state as well
 
00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:13.010 align:start position:0%
so that would protect the state as well
yeah

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they'll come up with the
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
language represent Damon
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
so in that paragraph see on the last
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
page would we take out the initial
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
phrase upon receipt of a written request
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
from an applicant that they wouldn't
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
have to make a request I would I would
 
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
scratch completely see I'll just scratch
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
the entire thing
 
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I mean I think you could just
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
change upon written request to within
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
five business days the department shall
 
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
issue written findings that the
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
applicant has a permit by default to sub
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
paragraph B right that's good that was
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
the second half to put of what I was
 
00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
going to say to put a time frame in yeah
 
00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:55.609 align:start position:0%
going to say to put a time frame in yeah
Within

00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
within five business days of the
 
00:34:57.599 --> 00:35:01.930 align:start position:0%
within five business days of the
expiration

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:01.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
so how many legislators does it take to
 
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
build a driver don't representative
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
um my question is um
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
what the public official who's making
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
the decision would they be able to get
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
an extension beyond the 14 day
 
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.910 align:start position:0%
an extension beyond the 14 day
period

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
not not the way this is written right
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
they already had 30 days and 45 days so
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
30 days is for
 
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.170 align:start position:0%
30 days is for
um smaller

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
um smaller
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
unit or divisions and then 45 days are
 
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
for larger ones so the larger ones they
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
get a little bit more time okay
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative yeah so I think that the
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
30 days and 45 days already gives them
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
plenty of time and then you're saying
 
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
okay you haven't done what you're
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to do within the 35-45 days now
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
I'm giving you 15 days to do what you
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
have to do otherwise I get the permit so
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 45 minimum
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
was that fit 60
 
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.470 align:start position:0%
was that fit 60
um

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
60 days total before issuance of a
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
permit so representative and the
 
00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
department can buy some more time if
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
they ask for some more information as
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
long as they act
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
well it'll be uh in process if they act
 
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
on something and they ask for more
 
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
information I think that'll buy them
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
some more time and they're in you don't
 
00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
see that I see it as if if they deem
 
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
that the application is not complete
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
complete or they need additional
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
they can deny the application and then
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
the application is resubmitted and that
 
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
obviously if the submit the if they had
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
a reason for denial then just denying it
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
and making them resubmit would be
 
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.190 align:start position:0%
and making them resubmit would be
another

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
um way for them to start the clock over
 
00:36:58.970 --> 00:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
but it says
 
00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.690 align:start position:0%
but it says
um

00:36:59.690 --> 00:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
that the the language that he's adding
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
these 30 30 days and 45 days to is is
 
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
said permit application shall be
 
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.690 align:start position:0%
said permit application shall be
reviewed

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
and construction permit issued by the
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
department within so it's not just the
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
review but actually issuing the permit
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
within 30 or 45 days
 
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.650 align:start position:0%
within 30 or 45 days
um

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:26.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
not just asking answering asking for
 
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
more questions they could just deny
 
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
instead of asking for more questions and
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
then say okay now you have to submit
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
again and then we start our 30 days over
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
again well I think the denial though
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
they have to provide reasons why which
 
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
would and then would it would which then
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
the applicant can meet and resubmit I
 
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
assume well and any other on the other
 
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
hand they could approve it subject to
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
the applicant coming up with something
 
00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
different I think that would be better
 
00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:57.380 align:start position:0%
they would approve it subject to
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
something yeah I don't I don't see any
 
00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:02.099 align:start position:0%
reason why that wouldn't be Allowed by
 
00:38:02.099 --> 00:38:02.870 align:start position:0%
reason why that wouldn't be Allowed by
this

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
that can typically happen with these
 
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
um okay so what I would do is is scratch
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
on I'm looking page two
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:25.730 align:start position:0%
 
B

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
I thought you only have to change C
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
M I thought you only had to change the
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
first part because that that indicates
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
the 14-day period right I'm fine there's
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
no more 14-day period we've gotten rid
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
of that we've gone to within five days
 
00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
they issued the permit so you change the
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
14 to 5. so there's no EXT so if they
 
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:50.780 align:start position:0%
because because
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
in my opinion you know 30 days and 45
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
days is enough so right
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
um if you want to give them 45 and 60
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
days then then the 14 day extension
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
makes sense but if you're not then if
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
they haven't issued it within the 30
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
days or 45 days that we put then yeah
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
issuing the five by default within five
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
days well conditional I don't know that
 
00:39:16.089 --> 00:39:16.099 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
conditional what conditions would if
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
they don't if they haven't processed the
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
report what conditions would they put
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
place on it
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
so they'd challenge you the permit yeah
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
shall issue the permit
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
um by default within five days of
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
so you're changing a
 
00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.230 align:start position:0%
so you're changing a
um

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
so because within within 14 days so
 
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
instead you would say if by the end of
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
the 30 or the 45 days neither of the one
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
or two has happened then B strike 14
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
days within five business days after the
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
expiration of that application period
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
um they will issue that
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
default permit right right right
 
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619 align:start position:0%
I like how's the committee feel about
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm fine with not having the
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
additional 14 days
 
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the department will come in and
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
ask for something else in there but I'm
 
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
okay with right now language I mean
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
getting rid of I mean we have two
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
different written requests that the
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
application applicant seems a little
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
more this seems this is Kaden we want I
 
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
want to streamline it right exactly
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
there's like two extra forms or whatever
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
that an applicant would be filling out
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
in addition to the original application
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
in this language that we are now getting
 
00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
rid of so now it's just the original
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
application you say yes or you say no
 
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
and if you don't say anything you
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
automatically give the yes
 
00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:44.750 align:start position:0%
automatically give the yes
foreign

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
okay and you automatically get the yes
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
and get notified of that yes without
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
having to have written requests of it
 
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.050 align:start position:0%
having to have written requests of it
okay

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
great so I don't I don't see a reason
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
for the committee have to meet about
 
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
this again I'll just draft that and
 
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:05.579 align:start position:0%
submit that as an LSR
 
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
if that works
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I know this has been quick but does
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
anyone else have have any updates for us
 
00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:14.099 align:start position:0%
represent Wallace do you have anything
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
not at this point okay
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
so oh representative oh please update us
 
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
um I was appointed to the
 
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
what is that called the speakers
 
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
appointed representative yeah to the
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
housing Champion Advisory Board which
 
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
would advise report help with
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
um rule making process for what would
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
designate a municipality as a housing
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
Champion so instead of submitting
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
legislation requiring these things right
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
um so I don't rely on representative
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
guide yeah I'm not so that that
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
amendment that I drafted before as far
 
00:41:57.119 --> 00:41:58.490 align:start position:0%
amendment that I drafted before as far
as

00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:02.060 align:start position:0%
um adding l into
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
statute the requirements that I thought
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
the legislature should add I'm just
 
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
going to produce those
 
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.569 align:start position:0%
going to produce those
um

00:42:11.569 --> 00:42:11.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:14.339 align:start position:0%
suggestions to that board which then
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
frees up
 
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.970 align:start position:0%
frees up
um

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative Reed to put a bill that
 
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
says that they are not suggestions if
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're a housing Champion but actually
 
00:42:26.089 --> 00:42:26.099 align:start position:0%
just requirements from the state that
 
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
I have a question of the committee how
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:45.980 align:start position:0%
a Statewide like 10 acre minimum bill or
 
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
as in a pro prohibition on anything
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
minimum over 10 acres but they can still
 
00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
have lower obviously because yeah well
 
00:42:59.650 --> 00:42:59.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that we should have
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
learned our lesson from the Adu law that
 
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.410 align:start position:0%
learned our lesson from the Adu law that
says

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
if you suggest to the municipality that
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is the maximum that they will they
 
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
can do then they have a frequency of
 
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
putting that maximum as they're like
 
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099 align:start position:0%
shooting target
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
um that that's what they're going to try
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
and do
 
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit I understand and I
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
sympathize and I
 
00:43:33.839 --> 00:43:34.910 align:start position:0%
sympathize and I
um

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
would support the bill but I think that
 
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.490 align:start position:0%
we are
um

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.309 align:start position:0%
um
possibly

00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
incentivizing municipalities to move
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
more with that legislation
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
up from two acre to ten acre where I
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
think that what we should be doing is
 
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
incentivizing them to do something more
 
00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
like the
 
00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:58.990 align:start position:0%
like the
um

00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
the D
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
e f the um
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
like soil basil yeah the soil based
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
suggestions from Des I think we should
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
be moving them towards that and away
 
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
from these arbitrary just I pulled this
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
number out of my hat
 
00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
um you know one through ten just pull it
 
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
out and that's ours our minimum maker
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
lot requirement like I don't think that
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate I think that it
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
should be based on actual science and
 
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
because you know going back to what
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative Reed always says that
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
it's about health and safety and if and
 
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
pulling it out of a hat is not uh health
 
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
and safety
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
and so I think it should be based on
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
actual uh representative
 
00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:47.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:51.260 align:start position:0%
I was that kid in school
 
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
I know the answer so representative
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
viocella has the benefit of me having uh
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
run these ideas by him
 
00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
um and I wasn't quite ready to out my
 
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
plan but I guess I will
 
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
um I am considering and I'm happy for
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
the um committee to weigh in on this and
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
I would hope that if I did put it in it
 
00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:13.460 align:start position:0%
would come to this committee
 
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
legislation that would explicitly tie
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances to health and safety
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
as per the what's it Nadine like I don't
 
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
remember the case name the the Supreme
 
00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
Court the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
case that said that zoning ordinances
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
need to be like this but we don't have
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
it in legislation and I would like I got
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
language from mercatus on this because a
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
number of other states have attempted
 
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:44.099 align:start position:0%
something like this I think the language
 
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
they sent me was from North Carolina and
 
00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
um basically it's just saying that
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances have to to be in other
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
words a municipality cannot pass a
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance that isn't directly
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
tied to the health and safety of the
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
people and there's some like specific
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
examples for example it can't be for
 
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:05.220 align:start position:0%
assessments or the increased valuation
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
um my because I don't like just doing
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
something really mean
 
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to kind of offer something
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
to the municipalities in exchange for
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
this and bear with me
 
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of you I think
 
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
representative baruti and representative
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
De Lorenzo have been around I'm sorry
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
have been around long enough to remember
 
00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
that I put in
 
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
um twice over a cacr called the
 
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
community rights amendment that would
 
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
have enabled towns to pass ordinances
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
for the health safety and Welfare of
 
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
their people and that was specifically
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
targeting a lot of these big corporate
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
projects like USA Springs that came out
 
00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
and like bought all of the water out
 
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
from under was it Lee or I don't
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
remember what town
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
um and so my idea my thought would be on
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
the one hand to enable towns in
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
legislation to pass those types of
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
ordinances that are for the help safety
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
and Welfare of the people but then at
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
the same time in the same legislation
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
prohibit zoning ordinances that don't
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
have to do with health and safety of the
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
people so it's it's a bit of a give and
 
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
take and I I probably shouldn't have
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
tipped my cards this early and not
 
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
having it fully baked yet but that's
 
00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
where I'm going and I've got some
 
00:47:20.329 --> 00:47:20.339 align:start position:0%
language from a couple of people to to
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
I guess representative
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
um I guess I have a couple more thoughts
 
00:47:40.619 --> 00:47:42.349 align:start position:0%
um I guess I have a couple more thoughts
about

00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
um like kind of on that same line as far
 
00:47:47.569 --> 00:47:47.579 align:start position:0%
as discriminating against
 
00:47:47.579 --> 00:47:48.890 align:start position:0%
as discriminating against
um

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
homes with small square footage
 
00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
is this is this a good conversation for
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
you guys
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
and and there was also some some
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
thoughts about
 
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.589 align:start position:0%
thoughts about
um

00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
um RVs and tiny homes being
 
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
discriminated against right are you
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
thinking about doing anything with those
 
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
so the broad language for mercatus I
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to put in more specifics around
 
00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
type of structure and technology and
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
that would extend also to what we were
 
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
talking about with septic technology
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
that everything has to be they can't Pro
 
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
discriminate against any particular type
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
or any particular technology so long as
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
the performance of said thing lives up
 
00:48:29.809 --> 00:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
to the state or federal requirements
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
whichever is more restrictive so again I
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
don't have the the language flushed out
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
but I am looking towards doing like
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
getting the right language to aim in
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
that direction so that there is no
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination around type of housing so
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
long as it's suitable
 
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
um per state and federal requirements
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
there's no discrimination against type
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
of technology so long as it does the job
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
correctly so if I would very much
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
welcome your assistance in helping
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

00:48:59.210 --> 00:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
all right great well thank you everyone
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
I think that I don't see a reason for us
 
00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
to meet for the next
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
um so I'll keep the committee posted on
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
when our next meeting is but as of right
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
now we don't have anything planned
 
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
um I'll plan on hopefully everybody will
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
submit an LSR and forward that to the
 
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
committee so we can read them and sign
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
off on them but I would hope that if you
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
submit an LSR for the housing committee
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
you just flag it for me so I can let the
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
speaker know that it's something that
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
we've discussed in the committee so he
 
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
can hopefully send it our way
 
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative Damon and representative
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
so can you just clarify process for me
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
as the Newbie LED chair
 
00:49:41.329 --> 00:49:41.339 align:start position:0%
so submit the LSR make you aware of it
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
and you send it to the committee I just
 
00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're on board with
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
the 91a yep you can submit an LSR and
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
then allow co-sponsors to be open to
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
only members of the special committee on
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
housing for a while and then once that
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
sign off happens then you can submit it
 
00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know for senators or or other
 
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature if they if
 
00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:02.339 align:start position:0%
they choose to but I think
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
my my purse my lsrs will only be open to
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
member of this members of this committee
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
first and allow them the possibility to
 
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
sign off and then we'll continue to the
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
rest of the legislature so OLS will can
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
handle all that if you let them know
 
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
so the OLS would communicate to the
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
members of the housing committee as
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to the person sponsoring the ls
 
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
Army you can you can flag that you've
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
submitted an LSR for the committee and
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
opened it up for co-sponsors okay thank
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I had some kind of question along
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
that same line because I was thinking
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
that generally you don't
 
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
you're not notified by unless you're
 
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
added as a co-sponsor
 
00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.750 align:start position:0%
added as a co-sponsor
um

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
and then you're just Cho your choices to
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
sign off or not on that
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
um legislation so it would be my
 
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
preference that if you're doing anything
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
for housing or that you just add me as a
 
00:51:00.359 --> 00:51:02.210 align:start position:0%
for housing or that you just add me as a
co-sponsor

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and then I can tell tell
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
um OLS no I don't want to be a
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor or yes I will sign off and
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
then then you'll know so then I get the
 
00:51:16.809 --> 00:51:16.819 align:start position:0%
notification and so from from OLS
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
think whenever anybody's files analysts
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
are that they should notify you number
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
one in this person amongst the committee
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
so we know which ones we want to jump in
 
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
on yeah
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative Reed I I agree that it'd
 
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
be good for everybody to notify each
 
00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
other on this committee I will point out
 
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if it extends to lsrs
 
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
yet but the Nifty new tool on the
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
website that the clerk's office and OLS
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
and Tech have all come together to to do
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
when it's been in the works for many
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
years unfortunately is that you can
 
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
follow a bill and hopefully that means
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
you can follow an LSR so you can sign up
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
and and follow the updates on it
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
I haven't given that a try but that
 
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
that's good to know I'm going to try
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
that for some of mine
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
you should also tell your constituents
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
and this is something I put talk about
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
motivating I put in four different times
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
a bill requiring because the powers that
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
be refused to allow regular citizens to
 
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
subscribe by email to our house calendar
 
00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:18.109 align:start position:0%
subscribe by email to our house calendar
email

00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
email
 
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:20.339 align:start position:0%
for the longest time forever it was only
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
state reps that were doing it and now
 
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
because I put in that bill four
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
different times and it passed the house
 
00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:27.059 align:start position:0%
the first time unanimously
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
um but finally the the pressure gained
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
enough to uh the last time I said I'm
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
putting in an LSR I put in the LSR and
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
immediately within 30 minutes it was up
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
and running so as always I appreciate
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
your passion on not only this issue but
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
other issues in the legislature so thank
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
you representative Reed all right we are
 
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
