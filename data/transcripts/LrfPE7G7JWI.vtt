important topic uh that we could um talk

about a little bit but really would
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
require um oversight U visitation of the
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
issue next

meeting I have just noted you into the
 
00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:05.959 align:start position:0%

sir ready ready good morning um I for my
 
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner's update uh this morning I
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
would like to speak with you about the
 
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
Department's road map so what you have
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
in front of you uh is there's a a
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
two-pager uh back back side to side
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
which is sort of the clip note version
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
of the heavier packet of what you have
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
here um in color copy so
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
um you'll have the full detail um as it
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
is on our currently on our website um
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
and that we've been sharing but this is
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
uh one of the first uh chances to share
 
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
it publicly with this committee uh the
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
work that the department has prioritized
 
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
and will prioritize over the next
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
several years um if you recall last year
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh we had a road map we uh launched it
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of um looking at goals that
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
were important in that first 12 months
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
we've then taken that report in that
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
work and looked at as a collectively as
 
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
an agency as an organization our
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
directors our staff working together to
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
build this document that continues some
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
of that work and picks up some new work
 
00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh but the similarities are that we have
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
a road map that basically highlights
 
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
three commitments which is what you will
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
see on this front page here so these
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
circles represent the commitments um and
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
they're described up on the very top as
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
the first is invest in people and
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
culture the SEC second is promote
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
thriving communities and the third is
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
improve customer service so we have
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
multiple initiatives and goals within
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
all of that and that's what you'll have
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
here in this
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
document but at a high level we know
 
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
that without our Workforce it's
 
00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
impossible for us to do our job at the
 
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
department so it's really important that
 
00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
we have a strong Workforce uh invested
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
Workforce well and that we have a
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce so in terms of retention and
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
recruitment that's what the focus is
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
here we look at some of our top uh
 
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
positions that have the highest turnover
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
rate um really Target those uh numbers
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
and bring those numbers down and also
 
00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
increasing job satisfaction for our
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
staff um as you're probably aware a lot
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
of our staff have very difficult jobs um
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
and we want to keep them uh doing the
 
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
best that they can and and feeling that
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
they uh belong and are part of the
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
department so a lot of effort has been
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
made uh particularly by myself and my
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
leadership team to invest in our staff
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh to make those things happen because
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
promote thriving communities which is
 
00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:30.519 align:start position:0%
the second commitment is a lot of our
 
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
policy work and our program work so we
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
need our Workforce to do that work if
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
you look at uh the circles I'll go off
 
00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
of the uh two-pager here uh for the
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
promote thriving communities you'll see
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
things in there like Mission zero which
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
has been our initiative to eliminate
 
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
emergency room boarding um you'll see
 
00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
things about environmental uh Health
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
impacts lessening that those those are
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
things like lead that we see in our
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
child care centers and and schools that
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
we've been working on um funding to
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
schools basically Medicaid to schools
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that schools have the
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
ability and the infrastructure and the
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
administrative in infrastructure to be
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
able to build for
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
that um we have uh I'm sorry did you
 
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
have a question oh I'm sorry okay okay
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
sure let me just go through this um we
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
also have our waiver which is basically
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
the successful transitions into the
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
community for individuals after
 
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:26.839 align:start position:0%
incarceration that's been a project
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
that's been worked on for many years uh
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
in collaboration with Doc so that folks
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
coming out of institutional care can
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
receive Services before they're actually
 
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
discharged and then um be in the
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
community and stay in the community and
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
reduce recidivism um and there's all
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more detail in the um the
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
packet itself um looking at our
 
00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral residential Ser or
 
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health System including
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:57.079 align:start position:0%
services for that we just recently
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
launched an overall assessment that's
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
system has been in place for a while
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
since be right around covid um and it's
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
time to look at and reassess uh where
 
00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:07.759 align:start position:0%
the resources are are they in the right
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
where the utilization is the resources
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
are those all in the right spots so
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
we're embarking on that work now uh
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies a lot of
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
that really about making sure of good
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
prenatal good postnatal uh postpartum
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
care as well uh we have our system of
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
care for healthy aging which is a very
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh system that we've
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
launched uh last year with a lot of
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
deliverables um as well as the
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
developmental disability system which is
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
work that we've been working on for
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
years as well and we've had quite a
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
successful last year and um getting some
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
stability and then moving forward with
 
00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:44.759 align:start position:0%
strengthening the system things
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
including rates and services so that's
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
that that promote thriving communities
 
00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:52.759 align:start position:0%
is is chalk full of uh the bulk of the
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
work that we do but I will just say that
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
just because it's not in the road map
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's something that we're
 
00:14:59.749 --> 00:14:59.759 align:start position:0%
not working on it these are the things
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
that we're sort of lifting up um a
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
little bit uh higher than some of the
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
other things um the last one is improve
 
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
customer service and when we look at who
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
our customers are we have internal
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
customers obviously but we have external
 
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
customers um so it's the it's the Soup
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
To Nuts on that one it's really looking
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
at you know who our partners are are we
 
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
able to not only provide the customer
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
service to the the people that we serve
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
but also the providers that we work with
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
are we able to pay bill on time are we
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
able to have good contracts do we have
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
interest from providers to partner with
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
us to do the services that the
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
department um is responsible to do
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
there's things in there about document
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
retention there's things in there about
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
responding to right to no requests and
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
and and working with that system and
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
making improvements there so a lot of
 
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
supon nut pieces on the administrative
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
backbone of it so that so that is like
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
my Cliff note like five minute summary
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
of of the road map that has taken us
 
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
months uh to to deliver we have launched
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
this in June um so it's relatively uh
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
fresh off the press there and I intend
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
to use this through obviously this
 
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
legislative upcoming legislative session
 
00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:13.959 align:start position:0%
and budget hearings as well uh to
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
identify the Department's priorities and
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
where we're putting our
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
effort and on the back just before I end
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
um just a summary of you know again our
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
mission our vision and our values in
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
terms of the department so this would be
 
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
something that we could share you know
 
00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:30.759 align:start position:0%
widely with our stakeholders so with
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
that I'll stop there if there's any
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
questions how many authorized positions
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
does DHHS have authorized I mean well I
 
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
mean not the people who you don't tell
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
us about just the ones that have been
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
approved by the
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
budget I think I mean you mean adjusted
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
authorized yeah I guess well we have
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
more than 3,000 but we can't go over
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
3,000 permanent permanent fulltime but
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
we don't have that many positions filled
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
well that's my next question so I want
 
00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:03.799 align:start position:0%
to start with how many may you
 
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
have right now I only have a little over
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
2700 filled out of
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
3,000 3,000 is what I can't go for the
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
cap yes next question um given the US
 
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's elimination of the
 
00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:22.990 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's elimination of the
Chevron

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
Chevron
 
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
deference um I was reflecting on that
 
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
thinking of the six years I was in
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
health and human Services committee and
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
the four years I've been chairing this
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
group that I've had a lot of interaction
 
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
with DHHS some of it uh during the
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic and found the relationship to
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
be very good I mean we didn't always
 
00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:45.799 align:start position:0%
agree but we could talk we could respect
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
each other sometimes they took my point
 
00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
other times I took theirs and sometimes
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
we agreed to disagree so I'm wondering
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
if um the elimination of the Chevron
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
difference what the ramifications might
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
be be for the
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
Department can I get back to you on that
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
sure privately
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
sure any other questions representative
 
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
Edwards um as you might uh suspect Mr
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
chair i' I've got several uh and I'll
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
I'll come back to you um okay all right
 
00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
and and uh so commissioner Weaver i i i
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
routinely tell people uh when I'm not
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
around you that you probably have the
 
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
hardest job in New Hampshire you know uh
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
so so I I appreciate all that you don't
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
you tell her now that she's here huh I'm
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell her that to her face
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
for once I think you have one of the
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
hardest jobs in New Hampshire and I
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
include the governor in that by the way
 
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
um so I so I have just some questions uh
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
to just make sure I understand where
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
where things are um I I think for
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
example on the mission zero um you all
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
established a completion date um that
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
was 2 years out from when you
 
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:05.240 align:start position:0%
established the date I'm just curious in
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
general are we on track to achieve
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
Mission zero or or are you expecting
 
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
there to be problems well just to
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
clarify it was one year I had one year I
 
00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
woned two the court gave me one um and
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
that was this past May and we received
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
an extension um that we did not request
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh we received an extension until the
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
end of this calendar year for that but
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
within the last 12 months from May of 23
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
to May of 24 we've seen about a 50%
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
reduction in weight days time in
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
actually sitting in the Ed so we are
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
definitely trending in the right
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
direction um will we hit some days we
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
hit zero and those are days that we
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
celebrate loudly but the queue fills
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
back up the difference is is that the
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
speed and the efficiency with emptying
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
the queue is is quicker than it has is
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
is improved much more improved than it
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
has been for many many years so we have
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
all of our systems working together to
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
clear that queue every single day right
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
so so on a kind of a daily sensus sort
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
of way of thinking about it how many
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
patients on average do we have in an ER
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
hold awaiting more definitive
 
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039 align:start position:0%
care yeah so that's it's it's not as a
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
black and white as answer of that when
 
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
we look look at the breakdown of that
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
because on Mondays it's higher than it
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
is on Wednesdays and Thursdays so I
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
could hit a zero on Wednesday and
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
Thursday I'd be really high but on
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
average probably less than
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
10 and and it and it had been as many as
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
40 or 50 right or 60 yes or so so that's
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
great progress may have a different
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
question hold that and um to what degree
 
00:20:47.149 --> 00:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
do you have real control over this
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
because some of it is problems
 
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
Downstream that you would love to get
 
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
them out of the hospital and the
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
hospital would too but if there's
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
nowhere for them to go they can't go
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
there so
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
so Mission zero is comprised of six
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
strategies and one of those strategies
 
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
is discharge of where folks are going
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
after that so we are exercising our
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
ability and Authority within our
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
Authority for as much as we can control
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
and then working with our partners for
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
the things that we can't control to to
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
your point earlier is that we may not
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
control it but can we work together
 
00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
collaboratively to to make some systems
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
Improvement and change and and we have
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
been okay there's still ways to go but
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
for taking the question commissioner um
 
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.990 align:start position:0%
for taking the question commissioner um
on

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
the lavender under the promote thriving
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
communities one of the elements is to
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
reduce Health impacts of environmental
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
threats can you explain how the
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
Department's working with the Department
 
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services because that's
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
kind of the link between health and the
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
environment and my specific question is
 
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
in CL mon we have
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
a possibility of having a transfer
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
station turned into a um actually
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
recycling center the transfer station
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
which would then bring a lot of heavy
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
metals into our community including
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
Mercury Arsenic and so forth along with
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
other things like Asbestos and my
 
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
concern is that those are Health
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
elements but they're really not under
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
the domain of the department but under
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health I mean
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
environmental services so how is DHHS
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
working with Dees in order to minimize
 
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
and try to accomplish a
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
strategy well I have no one from public
 
00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:36.919 align:start position:0%
health with me here today at any level
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to pinch in for them but
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
first of all you know we're located in
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
the same building Dees and public health
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
are um and that proximity is very
 
00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
advantageous to working on these types
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
of issues so I will tell you whether
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's in the road map or whether it's um
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
a recall on lettuce um we work hand
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
inand with them on all of those
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
initiatives so in terms of what control
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
that we have we don't but we do have
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
influence and we do have voice with them
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
to be able to work together even though
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
if we may not be The
 
00:23:06.919 --> 00:23:08.470 align:start position:0%
if we may not be The
Driver

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
Driver
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
followup um if I could find somebody in
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
the Department of Public Health because
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things within the
 
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
community is really concerning to the
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
community because we're looking at
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 50 to 60 large trucks
 
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
coming through the community um there's
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
a school near where that location is
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
going to be within 1,000 ft um so
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of concern on the health
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
side about all these things coming
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
through the community as well as going
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
into that particular location so I'd
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
like to really talk to somebody within
 
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health Human Services
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
and what we can do to try to mitigate
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
that sure I will have the public health
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
director reach out to you um and and so
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
just so you know they may already be
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
working on on this but I will have Ian
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
wat reach out to you any other
 
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
questions I know just giving other folks
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
the chance representative Edwards
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
all right uh again thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam commissioner I I want to
 
00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
talk to you about uh for just a moment
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
one of these bullets I think you
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned was about building some
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
infrastructure around the school's
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
ability to do charging for their pupils
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
I I think I heard you say that which
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
which one of these bullets might that be
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
is is it the continue Federal funding to
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
local education agencies or yes it is so
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
so so this is the topic that I would
 
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
like to um um bring out and emphasize in
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
the next oversight meeting because when
 
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
we first started the um the clinics in
 
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
in schools program uh there was a fairly
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
clear understanding I thought at the
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
time that we were talking about two high
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
schools that parental consent was going
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
to be required for every interaction
 
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
between the student and the clinic um
 
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
and uh and that those requirements had
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
gotten into uh the contract I'm I'm I'm
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
hearing from people in the community
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
that they think that this is this
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
program has been subject to a scope
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
creep and they are concerned that uh we
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
are circumventing the parental notice
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
and approval process by um because of
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
federal mandates on the program and so I
 
00:25:37.389 --> 00:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
would like to um have you come back with
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
the right team next month to to lay out
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
exactly how we started this program two
 
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919 align:start position:0%
years ago and where it's at now and in
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
terms of its scope and its impact on
 
00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
parental rights and and how this program
 
00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
is being financed uh and and and where
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
your experts think uh it's going to be
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
in a in a couple years I mean how are we
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
trending so those are the kinds of
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
things I'd like to add to next month's
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
oversight um I will consult
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards with uh attorney
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
Edwards who's my schedule maker and
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
keeper as to where there might be a spot
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
either next month or in
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
November thank you um so I I don't know
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
if you want to say anything to what I
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
just said but I I have a different
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
question next
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
um how about we save it till we get on
 
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
the agenda so that we can get to your
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
next question okay
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
um I love this bullet about support
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
successful transitions in the community
 
00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
for individuals after
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
incarceration so in the past week I've
 
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
gotten involved in talking to an
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
advocate for the disability
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
rights organization there's an A and I
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
don't know what their a stands for but
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
um the the concern
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
is that um that we haven't made public
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
yet what our census Management program
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
is going to be to try to keep residents
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
at the new cunu center and even
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
currently but but mostly the target I
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
think is the the new Youth Development
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
Center the concern is the the public
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand and I I don't
 
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
understand uh what active measures we're
 
00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
going to be taking to to keep uh our
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
census at 12 and if it goes over 12 what
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to do you know to manage
 
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
between 12 and 18 um and then that 19th
 
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
patient I really need to understand what
 
00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to do with the the the
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
potential 19th person that needs to be
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
in the Youth Development Center but
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
you're prohibited by law I think from
 
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
having them in there so I I I just need
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
to understand all of that and I think
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
the community needs to as well do do do
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
you do you think you could get people to
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
come maybe put together a special
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
presentation on the census management
 
00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
for the Youth Development Center um sure
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's it's active on our
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
radar it's active discussion I I just
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
want to kind of pull back a little bit
 
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to say that um what the
 
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
department can do in terms of
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
controlling census and what we have done
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
is if we think about the JJ
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
transformation juile Justice
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
transformation work that we've done that
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
is all about diverting kids out of
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
keeping them out of a place like senuna
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
center right um and we've seen a 50%
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
reduction in the last two years about
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
that so that's if kids don't need to be
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
there there doesn't mean they're not
 
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519 align:start position:0%
getting Services it means they don't
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
officially become part of the system
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
which is what we want right um we've
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
averaged over the last two years about
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
16 youth in the facility so we know
 
00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's where we've been we know
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
that our Target needs to be between 12
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
and 18 12 with the ability to go up to
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
18 if needed um in that space um but
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
we're actively working with courts and
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
gpbo and all of our teams and
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to come up with what is
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
that plan if that day arrives but I
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
think it's really about the version on
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
the other end of it before it is about
 
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
what do we do oh no they're here um but
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
happy to have more of a conversation
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
with you about that representative
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
Edwards you'd be happy to know that the
 
00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
department has had very good
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
communication with the town of Hamstead
 
00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:30.519 align:start position:0%
which I represent uh Dr hen has been
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
frequently available to answer the
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
questions and remember I live 300 yards
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
from where that new place is going so
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
I'm quite interested in this and I want
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
to thank the department for your
 
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
Communications especially the department
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
I think is been really great I mean
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
nationally we're first or second in
 
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
terms of the lowest per capita housing
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
in these scenarios so we're we're
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
already operating from a position of
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
great strength and great accomplishment
 
00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:00.919 align:start position:0%
but I but but I think there's still this
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
need for the public to understand the
 
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:05.799 align:start position:0%
the active measures that are going to be
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
put in place around the census
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
management and and I think if if that
 
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
were clear a lot of at least some of the
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
consternation and the advocacy groups
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
would be you know mitigated and that's
 
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
kind of what I want to do is just have
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
us all get along sure I think you guys
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
are doing great we just need to make it
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
more public um and then uh if I more one
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
um you you I I love the fact that you're
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
referring to people as customers I think
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's the right framework for a
 
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
government entity to be thinking in
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
terms of customers so so I love that you
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
use the term you have internal and
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
external customers and I I agree with
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
that but I I'm just curious how you
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
define uh internal and external
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
customers just a little bit more sure so
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
our internal is obviously our staff our
 
00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
own staff and within the agency but
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
there's 43 other state agencies we work
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh with many of them as well uh they're
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
also our customers for for different um
 
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
aspects of it as well as obviously the
 
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
people that we serve the legislature is
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
a stakeholder the governor's office is a
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholder I've got multiple
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in terms of what we do the
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
community is a stakeholder all of our
 
00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
providers our advocacy groups uh parents
 
00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:31.110 align:start position:0%
providers our advocacy groups uh parents
youth

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
everyone any other questions
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
chairman uh under the customer service
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh category and I don't know if this is
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
something you you know right off the top
 
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
of your head so you can get back to me
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
if you need to but uh actually it's a
 
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
two-part question Mr chairman if I may
 
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
you may uh do you know what the off hand
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
the case loads for the um I don't know
 
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
if you still call them Family Services
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
Specialists and DFA how many cases they
 
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
currently have I know when I was in the
 
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
department it was like hundreds uh each
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
you know the the actual people who
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
administered the food stamps and and met
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
with the clients and so forth and also I
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
was curious about the workload of the
 
00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:16.519 align:start position:0%
case load for the child protective
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
service workers in DCF uh how that is
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
right now too sure so I can tell you I
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
can get back to you with the exact
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
numbers for the family service
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
specialists but it is in the several
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
hundred uh range um and that is a little
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
bit different than a child protective
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
service worker who may be interacting
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
with the family every day where is with
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
the FSS workers that maybe uh the touch
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
points may be less frequent um I was
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
actually with uh two child protective
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
service workers yesterday uh as they
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
were going about doing their work and I
 
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
believe I asked both of them what their
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
case loads were and they were within the
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
limits of what they are which is uh for
 
00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
assessment um I think she had uh 12 and
 
00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
then Family Services is right around the
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
same 1213 area so they're within the the
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
bounds of where they're supposed to be
 
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
um of course that es and flows depending
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
on attrition and people having to pick
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
up cases when people leave but at least
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
the folks that I randomly spoke to
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday were within those limits and
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
when you look at our data dashboard
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see that as well I think in
 
00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
aggregate we're within where we're
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
supposed to be for family services and
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
for uh for assessment um in terms of uh
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
the FSS case loads there really isn't a
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh standard for those case loads and I
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
know that having worked on that for
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
years in terms of national standards for
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
case loads they are high again and that
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
es and flows but I can get you uh a more
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
exact number on that follow up with you
 
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that but I one more
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
question one more thank you Mr chairman
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
um so of the 300 positions not filled
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
some of them in those areas um where the
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
fss's and cpsws are uh yes those are
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
some of the vacancies yeah I think we
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
have more vacancies on the fs side FS
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
Family Services side now than we do on
 
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
the child protection side just one more
 
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
you're on a roll yeah well
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative Edward has set the
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
example for me um in terms of
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
streamlining and improving customer
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
services uh service is is part of the
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
goal to try to reduce the case load of
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
some of these folks is that part of the
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
streamlining process or is that not a
 
00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:26.919 align:start position:0%
realistic I know it's been this way for
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
a long long time so I think that's loads
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
I mean yeah I I don't I don't know if
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's um as explicit as you're saying it
 
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
in in the goal here but it is the it is
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
for every division to stay within their
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
policy parameters of what they're
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to have for case loads so part
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
of that is we're going back to we're
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
able to retain PE we're able to recruit
 
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
people and then keep people and then
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
they're working within the appropriate
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh standards that they have to be able
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
to do that so it is indirectly tied to
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
that but it's not as explicit in there
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you representative
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
Merchant you're welcome thank you Mr
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you commissioner I also
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to thank you for the report it's
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
well done thank you in regards to the
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
issue of personnel one of the things is
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
it mostly a question being competitive
 
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
in the marketplace with wages that are
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
causing a lot of the problems um can you
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
kind of what I'm trying to get to is how
 
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
do we as a legislative body help you
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
achieve what you're trying to achieve
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
some of it's going to be Financial so it
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
could be Regulatory and so forth but
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
what are the things we can do on our
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
side of the fence to try to mitigate
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
some of this because if we don't have
 
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
the Personnel a lot of things we want in
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
this report will never get accomplished
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
so what can we do on our side of the
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
fence to help you achieve what you're
 
00:35:45.069 --> 00:35:45.079 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve no it's an excellent
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
question and I would like to say that um
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
and remind you this is multi multi-year
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
plan um
 
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
and I think you know going into this
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
budget year is going to be challenging
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
obviously right having a having a a cap
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
on how many employees I can have is is
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
challenging as well I mean part of it is
 
00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
you know not even having enough staff
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
when when I started with the Department
 
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
27 years ago we had over
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
3,400 positions you know and now we're
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
down to like 2700 that's a significant
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
reduction in Workforce when we look at
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
other states comparable to New Hampshire
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
that with our Medicaid population we are
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
the most lean agency out of all of them
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
so we're doing a lot of work with
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
probably the
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
Staffing that we have so it's super
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
critical to to keep them um I'm going to
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
say I always want to have more staff
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
because I want to be able to provide the
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
services that we're going to need to do
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
so I think part of it is um trying not
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
to constrict the department and and
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get this work done when we say
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
what our needs are when they are in
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
terms of personnel uh salaries are
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
obviously always an issue right we just
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
we did have a significant increase
 
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
recently which is definitely helped um
 
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
and very appreciative for that but it's
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
still hard to compete with some places
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
that are paying more money for a less
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
stressful job if you think about the
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
work that the department does for our
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
case work this isn't like a widget job
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
or 9 to5 and you go home and you leave
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
it this is pretty intense work with
 
00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
families the most vulnerable in our
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
state and it's hard to find people that
 
00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:14.839 align:start position:0%
have the stamina of and and interest to
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
continue to do that so you know the work
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
conditions have to be right right it's
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
not just the pay it's the support it's
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
the good supervision it's the good
 
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
policy it's support from the legislature
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's all of
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
it follow up
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um can you sort of
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
help me understand how much of it is the
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
issue of the work itself which can be
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
stressful I'm sure versus the workload
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
which is connected to it because they're
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
really separate from each other um
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes if you have the ability to
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
decompress at times um you can get away
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
from sometimes the workload itself the
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
job becomes M more likely to be be
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
manageable so can you help me understand
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
is it really both the or how much of
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's the workload itself which is just
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do so much with so little
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
versus the job itself it's inherent to
 
00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.230 align:start position:0%
versus the job itself it's inherent to
it

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:38:08.309 --> 00:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
it yeah I think that's you know that's
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
hard to that's hard to answer right with
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
a large Workforce that for some people
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
it is going to be the work load for sure
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
um our supervisors do a really good job
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
at trying to create those stress Outlets
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
or or coping or support outlets for you
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh for our staff and for some it is
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
going to be the work environment so it's
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's probably a little bit of boat but
 
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
both but I haven't really Quantified if
 
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
if so if you but that's going to
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
probably be some of the work that we do
 
00:38:35.069 --> 00:38:35.079 align:start position:0%
going into this year that might tell us
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
more about
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
that if the commissioner uh is willing
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
um I am familiar with PTSD debriefing
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
through the fire department and so I'm
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
always concerned about the toll a job
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
takes on a person
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
individually I'm uh in discussion with
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary through the other hats I
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
wear about such debriefing possibilities
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
for judges who day in day out see
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
horrible things if you'd be so kind
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
maybe shoot me a brief email about the
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
nature of how your leaders do similar in
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
the DHHS that I can use as a side by
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
side with what I might like to see in
 
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
our Judiciary that would be very
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
helpful sure thank you anything
 
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:31.880 align:start position:0%

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
right I do of course if you
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
could thank you is this what we're
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
looking at I don't know because I don't
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
have it to look at it there it is it
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
looks like this thank
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
you um yep
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
it'ser no this has got a
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
St I think Senator it's the yep quality
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
and patient safety there you go all
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
right great thank you so much they
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes get silly yeah okay and we're
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
not going to read the report to you
 
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
verbatim but we just wanted to bring
 
00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
some highlights to your attention um to
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
remind the group The commit the quality
 
00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
and safety commission was first
 
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
legislated in 2005 and the purpose was
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
to provide confidential protections for
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
acute care hospitals to speak candidly
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
about Adverse Events and to identify
 
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
Improvement opportunities to make
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
patient care safer I do have to say that
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
those confidential protections are um
 
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
incredibly important and the group over
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
time has really learned to trust each
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
other and those conversations are very
 
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
rich for that reason it was made
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
permanent in 2019 and its scope was
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
expanded to include the 26 acute care
 
00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals our four specialty hospitals
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital Ambulatory
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
Surgery centers a design of the
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
commission of
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS and three at large public members
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
that represent the voice of the patient
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
which is very very important as we do
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
this work the commission meets in person
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
with a virtual option for extenda
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances feeling that in-person
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
attendance really does provide for that
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
information sharing and dialogue that is
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
so essential attendance at meetings this
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
past year was very high with 35 to 40
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
members on average
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
participating we use for guiding
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
principles to guide the work of the
 
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
commission and our agendas They are
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
promoting High reliability ility
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
organizations it's
 
00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:33.079 align:start position:0%
imperative as the health care delivery
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
system is very complex and we need to
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
have systems in place that allow for
 
00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
folks to be able to do things with some
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
standardization while also accounting
 
00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
for safety in the face of unexpected
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
events we establish just cultures within
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
our organization so creating cultures of
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
safety where healthcare workers are
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
treated fairly when errors occurred and
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
system issues are examined and balanced
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
against individual accountability adopt
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices to improve
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
outcomes and ensure Health Equity
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
diversion diversity and
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
inclusion in the 20123
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
2024 uh calendar uh commission
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
year there were review and discussion of
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
the most recent Adverse Events data
 
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
which is provided quarterly by New
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DHHS
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
like National Trend New Hampshire
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
experienced an increase in the number of
 
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events reported toward the end
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
of the federal Public Health Emergency
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
to remind everybody which ended in May
 
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.870 align:start position:0%
to remind everybody which ended in May
of

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
2023 as the hospitals and asc's returned
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
to normal operations and experienced
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
fewer Supply chains disruptions
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
refocused their quality improvement
 
00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:51.559 align:start position:0%
initiatives and started stabilizing
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
their Workforce with less res Reliance
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
on temporary contract Staffing I'm happy
 
00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
to to say the number of Adverse Events
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
decreased quarter over quarter
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
year part of refocusing quality
 
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
improvement efforts included an emphasis
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
to staff and providers on the importance
 
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
of events reporting and reinforcing just
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
culture when events occurred to examine
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
system issues as well as individual
 
00:45:21.549 --> 00:45:21.559 align:start position:0%
accountability as I mentioned
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
before factors that continue to hamper
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
Improvement efforts include ongoing work
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
force shortages as you heard from the
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh the healthcare Workforce
 
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:34.559 align:start position:0%
as you know is also experiencing those
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
longer lengths of stay for medically
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
cleared patients awaiting discharge
 
00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:41.559 align:start position:0%
dispositions which create subsequent
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
backlog of patients waiting an emergency
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
departments High surgical volumes and
 
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
pressures on staff to move quickly and
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
less experienced staff who require
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
mentoring thank you Chris
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
so recognizing the challenges of the
 
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
healthcare environment the commission
 
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
focused on best practices to proactively
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
identify potential process failures and
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
identify evidence-based tools to assist
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
our clinicians in hardwiring all those
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
necessary elements for Quality patient
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
care so the report describes all the
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
focus areas but I wanted to give you
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
some highlights of a couple in
 
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
particular could you tell us what page
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
you're on if you are reading we are not
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
read you're not that's why I couldn't
 
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
find it no we're summarizing we we'll
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
give you time to peruse that take it
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
home thank
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
you so as Chris mentioned we are getting
 
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
quarterly updates from DHHS on the
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
adverse event report so we're being able
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
to review those more real time with our
 
00:46:39.309 --> 00:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
uh commission members uh pressure
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
injuries continue to be the most
 
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
reported adverse event so our members
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
took a deep dive into the root cause
 
00:46:46.829 --> 00:46:46.839 align:start position:0%
analyses and demographic data for those
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
injuries um pressure injuries are very
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
common in Healthcare Systems it's the
 
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
most common uh adverse event across the
 
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
country so those multi-disciplinary
 
00:46:57.309 --> 00:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
teams are essentially to wound
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
prevention programs um as our staff with
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
specialty wound certifications which in
 
00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
some of our hospitals particularly in
 
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
critical access areas they do not have
 
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to have those um so members
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
experiencing higher numbers of pressure
 
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
injuries described leading some rapid
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
cycle Improvement programs in their
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals to identify gaps in practice
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
and we are actually continuing that work
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
into this commission year as
 
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
well uh the second most common event are
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
patient falls with injury um so that
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
continues to be a major Focus for us as
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
well especially as the New Hampshire
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
population ages we have an increase in
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
dementia and delirium um so we did have
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
experts from John's Hopkins activity and
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
Mobility Program speak to us uh which
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
was very exciting uh they provided an
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
eight-step framework to increase patient
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
Mobility kind of the use it or lose it
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
perspective that when our patients are
 
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
in hospitals that we're continuing to
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
encourage them to be mobile which also
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
helps to reduce pressure injuries and
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
some of the other Adverse Events that we
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
see um we did see an increase in
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
surgical events particularly wrong site
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
surgery so that prompted another
 
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
in-depth discussion by all of the
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
organizations who had experienced those
 
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
events to look for some common causes uh
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
several themes emerged from that
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
discussion which will serve as guides
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
for our organizational Improvement
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
efforts going forward uh we were also
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
privileged to have the chief medical
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
officer for the Center for Clinical
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
standards and quality from CMS come and
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
speak to us uh to explain their
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
strategic plan and goals for federal
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
health quality measurement and that uh
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
the CMO engaged members in discussion on
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
how New Hampshire hospitals and ASCS can
 
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
be successful with those programs uh it
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
was very nice to hear that directly from
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
somebody at
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
CMS um as I mentioned with the updates
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
that we get quarterly we can be nimble
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
and quickly address emerging issues that
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
our hospitals bring forward um or that
 
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
come through our DHHS reporting um an
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
example of this was a uh when a member
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
who and uh New Hampshire State
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist Dr Benjamin Chan
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
explained their process for engaging the
 
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.349 align:start position:0%
explained their process for engaging the
CDC

00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
CDC
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh to investigate and mitigate a cluster
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
of infections that were involving a
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to treat multi-drug resistant
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
organism that is not commonly seen in
 
00:49:07.119 --> 00:49:08.950 align:start position:0%
organism that is not commonly seen in
this

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
better you're very welcome um so that
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
was very exciting the commission
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledges the importance of workplace
 
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
safety as well and its impact on quality
 
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
and we invited the newly formed New
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Healthcare workplace safety
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
commission and to discuss ongoing
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
collaboration with that team uh quality
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
leaders in the hospitals and the ASCS
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
play a crucial role in staff reporting
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
of workplace safety events and the data
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
collection and we also had uh input from
 
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
one of our public members who urged both
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
groups to include patient and family
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
interviews after an event to gain some
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
information from the patient perspective
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
in those events which was a a piece that
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
we don't always think about when we're
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
focused on our staff so that was very uh
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
important so as we enter our 20th year
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh we remain very grateful to the New
 
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature for this unique
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
body in addition to holding our five
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
regularly scheduled meetings in 2024 and
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
25 we're convening a work group to
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
address the pressure injuries that I had
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
commented on before and to further
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
identify resources and best practices in
 
00:50:10.349 --> 00:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
between meetings to keep that momentum
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
going uh we've got ongoing collaboration
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
and education and we look forward to
 
00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
continuing to drive those adverse event
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
numbers down throughout the state in the
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
year to come do you have any questions
 
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
for US Representative
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
Merchant just my thank you Mr chair but
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
are we talking about strictly this
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
report or this report into open with
 
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:32.910 align:start position:0%
report or this report into open with
this

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
one this one only correct we're not
 
00:50:38.109 --> 00:50:38.119 align:start position:0%
talking about this report here at all
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
that's correct not yet thank you
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
chair I I have I have three different
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
questions um I'll come back to you um
 
00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
the first one is uh really as much for
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
for Mr Williams as yall we talked about
 
00:50:58.829 --> 00:50:58.839 align:start position:0%
it a little bit before the hearing that
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
there's another committee that got
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
established with the words uh quality
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
and safety in it as well that is the
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the department to to
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
host and I think I've been appointed to
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
that committee and and uh there's some
 
00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.710 align:start position:0%
that committee and and uh there's some
question

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
about whether or not that committee that
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
the Department's responsible for is
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to be meeting or if the work of
 
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
this Commission
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
uh obviates the need for this other
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
committee and so I'm I'm waiting for
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
Miss Tilly to come back it's been about
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
a month since I asked her the question
 
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm hoping to get an answer about
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
the status of the of the other committee
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
with a very similar name
 
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
um second this is a real question uh
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
that the first one is more of a
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
statement but
 
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
the on um Health Equity and
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
standardization of care
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh completely agree with the objectives
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
and philosophy what uh has um uh left me
 
00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
perplexed for at least two budget Cycles
 
00:52:09.549 --> 00:52:09.559 align:start position:0%
now as I talked to the department about
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
their numbers is I don't I don't yet
 
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
have metrics on how we're measuring our
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
success and and if we can't measure our
 
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
success we can't measure whether or not
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
we have a problem I I I think
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
generically we can assume
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
that we have a cultural issue and there
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
are some health outcomes problems as a
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
result of of U race language the things
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
that keep us different than the same but
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
but unless we're measuring it and
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
Reporting on it we don't know whether or
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
not we're accomplishing our objectives
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
and so could you could you talk about
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
what metrics you're using and the extent
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
to which you're sharing those metrics or
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
Services is sharing their metrics with
 
00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:03.559 align:start position:0%
you so so we know how we're
 
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
doing I take that or do you want me to
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'll defer that to you Chris okay um
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and I have to
 
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
wonder if you work for CMS um so the qu
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question I wish would
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
be more simple but right now I have to
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
say it depends so hospitals are
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
currently doing the work right now
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
they're starting the work and they've
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
been collecting some data um primarily
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
race ethnicity and language for some
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
time um but they're expanding the data
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
that they're collecting um and starting
 
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
various patient populations and
 
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
examining that data to focus in on where
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
the disparities are so it's a work in
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
progress so right now currently I can't
 
00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
say that that everybody's working on the
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
same metrics but the metrics are being
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
developed so I'd like to propose that
 
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
when we come back next year I might have
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
a better answer for you but that work is
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
being done right now individually by all
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
of our Healthcare
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
organizations third third question this
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
is a followup 2 a uh okay so um to be or
 
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
not Tob I think it's Tob thank you that
 
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
is the question
 
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.470 align:start position:0%
is the question
so

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that you may not know
 
00:54:34.789 --> 00:54:34.799 align:start position:0%
is that uh monthly The Joint fiscal
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
committee receives a a DHHS dashboard
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
and that dashboard gives us a a bunch of
 
00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
different categories of of data that we
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
should know about in the legislature on
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
how we're performing our our our
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
functions and I would love um and maybe
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
this is again for the Department I would
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
love to see that joint fiscal committee
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
dashboard extended so that we have some
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
metrics because I think we're assuming
 
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
disparity and that's a rational
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
assumption but until we can measure it
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
we don't know how to make investment and
 
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
policy decisions so so I think I think
 
00:55:16.349 --> 00:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
we just need to like bring that out into
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
the open so that we can all focus on
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
understanding the real problem and and
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
then and then I do have my third
 
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
question Tito on to three Okay so um on
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
page six there's reference to drug
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
diversion prevention and um the
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
legislature for the last I think year
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
and a half has had a conversation with
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
the uh Governor's Commission on alcohol
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
and drug misuse um about um how to
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
incorporate the concept of harm
 
00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
reduction into our commission's programs
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
and um and so as you're talking about
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
diversion uh I'm I I'm I'm I'm looking
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
at it wondering how this concept of harm
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
reduction fits into your Concepts and
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
what you think harm reduction is if you
 
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
if it's a factor that you're considering
 
00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
in this in these diversion efforts so
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's kind of an open-ended question I'm
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if you know anything
 
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
about the the on National debate on harm
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
reduction the state debate on harm
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
reduction and and how and and what your
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
it I'm happy to take an attempt to
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
answer that um so certainly as we are
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
discussing um drug diversion We are
 
00:56:41.309 --> 00:56:41.319 align:start position:0%
continuing sorry I'm trying to look at
 
00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:44.119 align:start position:0%
you through the speaker um we are having
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
those discussions uh we had a great
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
presentation this past commission year
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
on how we can proactively identify
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
employees that may be at risk and try to
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
interact with them and we do have uh
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
programs in the state to assist
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
employees who may be struggling with
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder um to get them
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
into a a path where they can address
 
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
that and not have to lose their job um
 
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
but that is something that we're
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
continuing to investigate and understand
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about I'm not sure if
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
that answers your question or
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
not it it it does answer my question
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
because what you just by your answer I I
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
know that the concept of harm reduction
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
isn't being debated and and argued in
 
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
your um in your commission um because
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
you didn't talk about the issues around
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
what what people are trying to do with
 
00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
harm reduction so I'll I'll I I won't
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
poke at it anymore I'll just let you
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
know that there's a national debate on
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
on what harm reduction ought to mean and
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
what kind of limits government ought to
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
be putting on these harm reduction
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
programs and that's just for your
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
general awareness I I I appreciate that
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
you want to divert people from substance
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
abuse thank
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your
 
00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:05.559 align:start position:0%
presentation but not yet representative
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman believe I
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
heard one of you mention I think it was
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
you may on the left there uh the term
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
wrong site surgery and could you
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that please sure so a wrong
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
site surgery would be any surgery that
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
was not where we intended to go so
 
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
typically people think of the right knee
 
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
versus the left KNE um typically what we
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
find in the events that are reported
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's very common for spinal surgeries to
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
actually be I would say the most common
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
wrong site situation that we have um due
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
to the leveling of the vertebrae um so
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
that is our most frequent um concern
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
where a there's a certain vertebral
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
level that they meant to go to they went
 
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
to the level below that so that is I
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
think the majority of um the situations
 
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
that we've encountered I don't know if
 
00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
you have any additional Insight on those
 
00:58:58.280 --> 00:58:59.910 align:start position:0%
you have any additional Insight on those
but

00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
um follow follow up okay so it's not
 
00:59:05.549 --> 00:59:05.559 align:start position:0%
when you say site it's not Vision it's
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's a location of the body a location
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant thank you sh
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
um I noticed in the
 
00:59:21.029 --> 00:59:21.039 align:start position:0%
report and I looked at the RSA it's
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
really focused on hospitals and amatory
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
surgical centers is there someplace else
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
in the RSA within the Department of
 
00:59:28.829 --> 00:59:28.839 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services that focuses on
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
long-term care they call it hinant
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
because long-term care is also a
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
healthare setting um I'm just curious if
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
there's any somewhere else in this
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
department or within your organization
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
that actually looks at long-term care
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.589 --> 00:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
care we would need to defer that to
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
good would you like to say I can stand I
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%

01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
antelo associate commissioner yes um I
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
don't have the statute right in front of
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
me but I believe it is our licensing
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
151e um because we have our
 
01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:19.039 align:start position:0%
certification and licensing unit that
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
looks at nursing facilities is there a
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
comparable report once a year like this
 
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
I will double check with um that unit
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%

year so there is also a performance
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
measurement system uh and a a way to
 
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:41.720 align:start position:0%

I was able to reach out um in response
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
to also working collaboratively with
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner Chris anelo um in
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
response to the earlier question by
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
represent Merchant that the specific

reporting requirements and the report
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
before you um were developed back in
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
between like 2005 2010 time frame it was
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
represent P Pula who was actually the
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee at the time and I
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
actually had the honor of working with
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
him around this legislation and people
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
like Charlie McMahon also worked on it
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
as well it was very specific to those
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
facilities that were licensed under RSA
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
151 that related to both hospitals
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
ulatory surgical care settings so that's
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
currently what's in legislation and
 
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
that's currently why the report before
 
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
you uh gives you statistics regarding
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
those two particular settings now with
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
that said the um the centers for
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid services do
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
require for long-term care facilities to
 
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
take very seriously uh the issues of
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events as it relates to the
 
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
long-term care setting uh in our agency
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
even though we're not charged
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
statutorily to to provide similar data
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
that you see in this nine-page report as
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
relates to those other two licensed
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
facilities hospitals and ambulatory
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
surgical care we do follow up
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
meaningfully with investigations of any
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
reports for such things as a bedf fall
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
incident in those particular types of
 
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
facilities with our uh licensing folks
 
01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
to conduct a review for those kind of
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
complaints so we wanted to let you know
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
there is a process in place to
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
investigate and to remediate those
 
01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
actions but it's not built into a
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
similar reporting requir that you see
 
01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
currently in statute as it relates to
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
facilities I thought I heard in an
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
earlier presentation that injuries this
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
is what I wrote down Etc decreased as
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
there are fewer contract agency temps
 
01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
used I think I heard that did you hear
 
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
that were you out of the room I would
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
have to defer to the presenters who had
 
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
provided you that information
 
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
and would invite them to join
 
01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
sure so that would be operative in this
 
01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
report as well and chairman Pearson just
 
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
because we do have a viewing audience
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
here and it is being live streamed
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh through the house uh streaming if we
 
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
could have uh I think that was Miss do
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
diamond perhaps or Miss Herring if they
 
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
could just join us and just repeat that
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
answer just so the viewing audience can
 
01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
good um thank you Chris Herring and um
 
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson to your question I had
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
reported that through 2023 as Adverse
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
Events were decreasing hospitals and
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers had also seen
 
01:12:35.709 --> 01:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
a decrease in contract staff would you
 
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
take that as coincident or
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
positive we were we came to the
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
conclusion that that was positive
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
positive I correct thank you thank you
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
welcome chairman yes representative
 
01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:55.719 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
um it may be addressed in here somewhere
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm afraid I didn't find it yet if
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
it is what is a pressure
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
injury and chairman McDonald I I should
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
have clarified um at the start that I'm
 
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
explaining that we don't have staff here
 
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
to respond to questions on a report
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
however attached are the is the contact
 
01:13:17.229 --> 01:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
information for who could address those
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
particular questions otherwise we could
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
work although you do have a very robust
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
agenda in October uh we could work to
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
having this carried over to the October
 
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
meeting to addressing these questions I
 
01:13:29.149 --> 01:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
just didn't know if you happen to know
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
what it was I can take a venture or I
 
01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
can refer to somebody else who might oh
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
I take
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
it Senator at risk of the New Hampshire
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association injury would be
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who was laying on their back
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
and because of that pressure uh there's
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
a preponderance for for sores and
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
different things so you're supposed to
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
be rotated and get you got to get up off
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
your feet and stuff okay
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
that is essentially correct yes it is
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
injuries to skin as a result of pressure
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
from a medical device or from the body
 
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
Lang on a bon P for a long period of
 
01:14:07.149 --> 01:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
time well thank all we have you then so
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair yes I I I I hear Mr Williams
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
that there's no one here to ask the
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
question but but for the purposes of our
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
committee I I I want to I want to tell
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
you what I'm going to uh try to email
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
over to miss shley and that is I think
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
this report um is is is really good it's
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of data what would be nice is to
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
have some help so that we could
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
interpret it like for example we see
 
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
that the trend is up and that makes me
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
wonder if that's because there's U more
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
bad things happening or we're just
 
01:14:44.629 --> 01:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
getting better at reporting I I think
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
it's probably a combination of both
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
because in previous hearings we've heard
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
that we're getting better at reporting
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
so for the record the team behind rep Mr
 
01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
Williams is not affirmative to I I'll
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
finish in a second represent Merchant U
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
the the the other point I would uh want
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
to ask them is if they could uh
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
Benchmark these categories to uh similar
 
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
States because I I see a bar graph and I
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
I can see a trend but I don't know at
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
what point we we're dealing with sort of
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
um the the reasonable level of incidents
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
that happened because humanity is
 
01:15:27.629 --> 01:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
imperfect or whether or not we we're
 
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
blowing through some benchmarks and we
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
got a real problem so so I could use
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
some help with some benchmarks and it'
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
probably be best to pick the five states
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
most similar to us and not New York
 
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
state for example or California you know
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
but but uh that would help uh interpret
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
this and then finally I I see uh in the
 
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
summary um that they've given a summary
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
but for a legislative report
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh they're not calling out in the
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
summary any major red light you know
 
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
they're not drawing our attention in the
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
summary to here's a problem we really
 
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
want you to see that this is a problem
 
01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't have that in the
 
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
summary and I I don't see any suggestion
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
of potential legislation so so all of
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
those I think would take a very nice
 
01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
data report and turn it into uh a report
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
legislators can interpret and use the
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
chair is going to rule nothing further
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
from the committee and make the
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion that if there are any
 
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations they be sent off to miss
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
shley and next month we might be able to
 
01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:41.320 align:start position:0%
squeeze in uh something that addresses
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
these questions that were just raised
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
and any others that may be sent along so
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
squeeze it in
 
01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
you review of new
 
01:16:59.310 --> 01:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
2024 reporting requirements and other
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
enacted legislation related to HHS
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
oversight committee Attorney John
 
01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
Williams director of legislative affairs
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
will walk us through several bullet
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
points we have here on the agenda about
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
things that I think are going to be new
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
for us and chairman uh pi and members of
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
the committee you may recall last
 
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
session or last year that I had come
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
before this committee and there were
 
01:17:28.629 --> 01:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
twice the number of new reporting
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
requirements uh whether they were
 
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
reports to the committee review by the
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee review and approval by the
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
committee uh so you really had a very
 
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
sizable increase of over 12 um items
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
from last session um this year uh you'll
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
see that there were four uh bills that
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
were enacted into law that do touch upon
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
this committee there's also uh to give a
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
call out to rent Edwards he has IR ly
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
taken ownership of the HB uh 323
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee that deals with emergency
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
emerging medical Technologies and we
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there will be a report
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
from that one that's from
 
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
2022 uh but that's another example of
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
something that's out there in terms of a
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
report to this committee um I can turn
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
it over to represent Edwards if he
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk at all about that group
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
before I get into the five that uh were
 
01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
okay so um it was a a bill um HP 323
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
passed in 2023 I believe that uh is a
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
year late on its inaugural report uh
 
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to have an inaugural report
 
01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't say much of anything other
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
then we think we should uh continue the
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
committee into the future uh it it does
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
have in the statute uh an address line
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
for HHS oversight so a copy will be
 
01:18:54.239 --> 01:18:55.590 align:start position:0%
for HHS oversight so a copy will be
delivered

01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh of this report to this committee um
 
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
but I don't but I don't know what
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
oversite wants to do with it whether
 
01:19:07.149 --> 01:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
we're just going to have it sent to us
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
or whether or not you're going to want a
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
presentation on it and uh for this
 
01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
inaugural report I I don't really think
 
01:19:16.270 --> 01:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
it's it would be more than a two-minute
 
01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
report but and I think I just kind of
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
gave it so um we'll take it as R and
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
look forward to the bill that would
 
01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
really get this thing cranking
 
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
okay so we have we do have the first
 
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
report one October it's coming out we
 
01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
can squeeze that in
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere and chairman Pearson
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
continuing on the bills that were
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
enacted this session the first of which
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
is HB
 
01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
1168 uh it is a study committee a
 
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee uh that's
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the impact of the housing
 
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
crisis on those receiving uh
 
01:19:49.629 --> 01:19:49.639 align:start position:0%
developmental services but also
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
individuals who have been um diagnosed
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
with with disabilities or identified as
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
having disabilities uh the uh study
 
01:19:59.950 --> 01:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
committee has met um at least on three
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
occasions at this point um they're
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
working very meaningfully with the
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
Department with
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
stakeholders uh and uh our anticipation
 
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
is because they've identified the issues
 
01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
as being very complex that they actually
 
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
have extended longitudinally their final
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
reporting date to November 1st of 2025
 
01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
with that said there is an interim
 
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
report that's due to this committee and
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
other uh entities as well on November 1
 
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
of this year and our expectations are
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
that they've already identified some
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
meaningful work that perhaps have either
 
01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:33.639 align:start position:0%
legislative or non-legislative solutions
 
01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
to access for those receiving
 
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
developmental services to housing um
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
particularly I'm looking over at Senator
 
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
gray one of the um uh areas for housing
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
actually involves the around the
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
straford County area so certainly uh
 
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
very meaningful work is being done again
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
a collaboration with the stakeholders
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
working internally in our department
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
several program areas are involved
 
01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
including uh associate commissioner
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
sano's area around long-term supports
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
and services uh and also with the legal
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
regulatory services around our Bureau of
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
Licensing certification and a special
 
01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
call out also to the State Farm
 
01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
Marshalls Office that's been
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
meaningfully working to try to address
 
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
uh barriers that might be um in
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
involving licensing issues to ensure
 
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
that those individuals get access to
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
housing yet maintaining some level of
 
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
Life Safety Code um uh protections for
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
th those individuals um do we see this
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh report being made to us in the next
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
one or two meetings it is anticipated
 
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
that with the tentative meeting in
 
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
November that that's when you would be
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
receiving the first um um interim report
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see it down here I'm probably if
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
you go to the first bullet um under HB
 
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
1168 you'll see inter report to be
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is I don't see it on
 
01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
your draft agendas for the next two
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
oversight meetings and because we have
 
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
so many items if you flip the page over
 
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:07.639 align:start position:0%
you will likely see it oh
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
wow two pages okay all
 
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
right thank you and that takes us to hb1
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
1573 this is a companion bill to Senate
 
01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.629 align:start position:0%
1573 this is a companion bill to Senate
Bill

01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
417 uh dealing with the oversight of
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
children in residential places ments um
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson you were the prime
 
01:22:28.189 --> 01:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill also you have
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
members of your committee here who also
 
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
served as co-sponsors and this is a
 
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
department um um uh item where we're to
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
be reporting on a quarterly basis uh the
 
01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
first report uh on a quarterly basis
 
01:22:44.189 --> 01:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
will be um honor before October 1st I do
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
know that that's being diligently worked
 
01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
on and you will be receiving if you
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
haven't already that particular quarter
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
report so this would be up for a topical
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
item for the October meeting uh and
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
you'll see there is a series of uh two
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
additional quarterly reports with the
 
01:23:02.189 --> 01:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
final quarterly report uh taking place
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
on October 1st of
 
01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
2025 um it's good when you see a
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
termination of the reporting
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
requirements because it does take from
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
this committee at least some items off
 
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
your very long list of over 50 reporting
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
items um that come to your committee and
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
the list does grow um every session but
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
fortunately there are some that do
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh HP 1609 relative to the commission on
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Workforce this is actually
 
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
a commission that's been in existence
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
for well over a decade and this bill
 
01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
essentially extended that commission so
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
it's not a new reporting requirement but
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
it is uh because they were scheduled the
 
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
sunset it was worthy of bringing to this
 
01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
committee's attention the important work
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
that they do particularly on the area of
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
healthare delivery in underserved
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
populations underserved areas within the
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
state and you'll see that they've now
 
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
extended their interim and final report
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh as you'll see reflected here uh
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
November 1st of 2026 uh for an interim
 
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
Report with a final report of November
 
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
1st of
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
2029 it's not on your draft agenda for
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
that for me yet is it uh not quite yet
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
until 2026 sir um so that takes us to
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
sen up Bill 355 relative to newborn
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
screening for syto Megalo virus uh you
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
may recall this is a very important
 
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
issue to to Senator Enis um he had a
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
personal connection
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh with this very devastating um um
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
viral um conal issue and so it's one
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
where the department worked
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
collaboratively particularly the
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
division for Public Health Services to
 
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
having this addressed through our
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
existing Authority Under administrative
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
rules and so you'll see that there's a
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
reporting date of March 1st of 2025 that
